It's organized differently than the website so it's completely unfamiliar. And it's obviously totally designed to sell not help. And yes I'm a paid, signed in subscriber.",

The service simply does not filter matches based on your preferences, age range, distance, etc. It is so misleading to be able to enter preferences and to discover that they are completely ignored not only in terms of who will send you messages but in the actual matches as well.",

I get the want to make money but this is borderline scam and if you want to compete with the other apps I would suggest fixing your pricing.",

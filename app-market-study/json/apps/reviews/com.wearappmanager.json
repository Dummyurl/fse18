Android Wear Manager takes the mystery out of that process. Among other useful benefits it let's me easily see which of my apps have installed Android Wear modules on my phone. It shows me how much space each app takes. It shows me what permissions each app is using. And it lets me launch the Android Wear version of the app directly. Nicely done!",

This takes some mystery out of that. The only major improvement I would love to see is a storage info, such as music etc, so watch storage could be managed. That would make this app perfect (if possible in the same application)",

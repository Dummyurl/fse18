Square takes a few hours, PayPal takes one day, Western Union takes maybe an hour.  So I see this app as playing catch-up with the other apps while holding up my money for much longer then needed. Very unhappy. This has caused me to be late with bills.",

Try promo code JFPAZY and then message me to get started. Update you will have to add your bank card to receive the free $5 dollars but they won't charge you and I will send you the money to get started!",

Having said that, Circle as a stand alone app for sending and receiving money from friends and family is just great with a few sneaky features that help make it fun too such as the ability to send a gif or a little thank you note.   Get it downloaded!",

Like it much better than PayPal although it would be better if when u cash out the money from circle went instantly into your bank account usually need to wait an hour for it to clear but apart from that its great",

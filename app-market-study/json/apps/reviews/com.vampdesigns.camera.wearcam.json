Samsung Gear watches use Tizen, and its apps are downloaded via the Samsung Apps store, or via the SamsungGear app for Android, NOT VIA GOOGLE PLAY STORE. As similar apps are also available there, those of you rating the ANDROID WEAR app badly because you're clueless should go try the software MADE FOR YOUR SAMSUNG DEVICE, and change your unfair rating of this one correspondingly. Your idiocy is mind-blowing. This s*** drives me nuts...",

Handy for nature pics, tricky or dangerous pics where you don't want to be too close, or fun catching candid shots or rare shots where you sit nearby, cam poised to catch the moment.  Maybe if distance range is sufficient you could put your phone on a drone and take aerial pictures.",

I do have apex pro but my droid turbo came with Moto notification thing which takes precedence over this. So I pretty much have to scroll twice to get to apex notifier and that is an arduous task indeed. Also I'm not a big fan of this app being dependent on both apex launcher (to be expected) and DASHCLOCK (not expected) which is made by another developer. Are you guys friends/affiliates or what?",

I did a factory reset before updating to Lollipop and another after the update.  I then installed all applications.  Then I installed Apex Launcher, Apex Launcher Pro and then Apex Notifier (in that order).  External notifications are enabled in Apex Launcher.    I did have one issue with a persistent notification that showed \"1\" unread SMS even after I cleared all of them.  This was resolved by going into the settings for the Android \"Badge Notifier\" app and clearing data.  This isn't Apex related, but I see several bad reviews here attributing it to Apex, so I thought I'd mention it.",

Well after trying several different remote apps I was exasperated, as they either relied on a completely unworkable wifi connection to the TV or lacked basic functionality needed to launch and control TV apps. Finally I found this app, and to my relief it performed the simple functions that I wanted and was very easy to use with great options for customization. I especially love the notification mini-remote!",

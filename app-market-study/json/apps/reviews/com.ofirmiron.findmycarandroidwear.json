        "comment": "I bought the Automatic OBD Device last year and kept getting prompted with the advertisement of the Find My Parked Car app.  So I tried it.  It worked for a while using the free version.  So I decided to buy the licensed version.  I did and now it doesn't automatically detect where I'm parked.  I read the advertisement and it said that I had to press a button to save my parking location.  I never had to to that before, and now after pressing the button the app still doesn't save my location.  The advertisement also says that it automatically detects where you park.  This is not true!!  The app shows where my phone is located (on which the app is running).  What is more frustrating is that the app shows a car picture as to indicate where I've parked.  Moreover, the advertisement says that it will prompt you to save the location.  I have yet to see a prompt even when I have it set in the settings to prompt me.  I'm so disappointed that I paid for the app.  I want a refund.",

        "comment": "Most Professionally Crafted App Of Any Type! This app is intuitive, powerful, compact and fun to use. I installed it on a cheapie ZTE phone with Android 5.1 and tested it for over a week. The app never failed to function. It is beautifully written. I tried many parking spot apps & this one beats them. I like being able to quickly (very quickly) mark my park. Bam! Done! Here Are Some Features That I Especially Appreciate: A) If the GPS on your phone miss marks the parking location, it is easy to drag the icon to the correct spot. <Mis-Mark is the GPS fault, not the app. All of my GPS devices mis-mark in certain areas.>  B) The map is very easy to view and I really like being able to quickly switch from seeing the car, seeing my location or seeing both at once. C) Taking a photo and leaving myself a note from within the app are handy to have when parking where there is no signal. No fussing around between apps. D) Using it offline works well too. If your device already has a map of the area, Find My Parked Car simply shows the map as if you are on line. (Save data time!) The developer/engineer answers questions very quickly, politely and thoroughly.  I like this app!",

While having a time of my own to balance my money-earning tasks and my schooling, I downloaded this app and bought its added features. Six months later, I passed my exams and was able to fulfill my freelance jobs with much ease. This app was very useful and I give it a lot of credit. Its customizable, gorgeous art design and reports can be exported via Excel. Pomodoro works and I didnt feel any stress. Really, thanks!",

Update: bought the extras pack and Dropbox Todo sync isn't working, I guess there are api problems? App is authorized, but todo.txt doesn't appear in dropbox. An error \"Error communicating with Dropbox\" flashes onto the screen for a second. But Dropbox app & website are fine.",

        "comment": "Clockwork tomato is the best pomodoro app there is, hands down. It works perfectly out of the box, but it is extremely customizable. You can change the duration of each part of the pomodoro, determine whether you want to extend a section or move on to the next one, and even set different sounds for each section of a pomodoro.  Most importantly, it tracks the pomodoros you make and gives you statistics on your productivity.  The only thing that I would add is the option to track distractions too,  like Flat Tomato on iOS.   I highly recommend this, and even more the extension pack (it's cheap and it adds profiles and the ability to keep todos).",

The rate of the timer was at a much higher meter than I would like, and I felt a lot of anxiety the entire time it ran. Like was being forced to hurry up. The parameters enable changing the volume, but not the speed. Considering a main feature of a pomodoro timer app is the sound of the ticking, it surprised me that an app with so many features would not support greater flexibility on a functional aspect of the design. Too bad, because I liked the concept a lot.",

Only issue I have is that 2 of my projects were allocated the same color which makes it a bit difficult to distinguish between them in the graphs etc.  Would be awesome if we could customize the colors of the projects (or at the very least not be given the same colors).  And a Gear S2 version (which should preferably sync back to the phone app) would also be great.  i.e. control the clock from my Gear S2, but see logged pomodoros in the phone app.  Just a thought.  :-)",

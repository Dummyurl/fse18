It is exactly like \"stock alarm\" except this lets your set your own music to the alarm:), since you listened last time, I was wondering can you add a dividend tracker to this app, plus also a display of the dividend in decimal  points $, not in percentages. \ud83d\ude01\u263aplease, please would really help. plus if you can add a notification if a stock changes it's dividend. have never found an app to do that, so you would be breaking new grounds.\ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4fthen it would be a 5 star app.",

Add dividends to the total P/L of the stock/fund. 3. It's a pain the @$$ having to add stocks and funds separately each time under each portfolio. It's not easy to use and needs to become more seamless.  Other than these much needed improvements for the actual active investor, this app has potential.",

        "comment": "I really liked the free app & after a month decided to upgrade to the Premium version which has a little more oomph & no ads. Unfortunately, none of my water data transferred over from the free app to Premium. I've already done the back & forth e-mails with Aqualert trying to figure out what the issue is & if it can be fixed (& yes, I followed Aqualert's instructions). I'm hoping they get it straightened out soon because it's a nice looking, easy to use app that's not too fussy...  Update 02/14/18: Still haven't received a response from Aqualert to figure out how to transfer the data from the free app to Premium, so I just went ahead & did it manually. It IS time consuming, but not too, too long if you don't have much to input. Still 3 stars until I've had more time to use the Premium app, but again, it's a nice looking app...much cleaner looking than other water tracking apps & simple to use...we'll see how it does in terms of other glitches...",

I wish I could add all the other drinks I consume so I would know if I should still be drinking the same amount of water or more, this would be a good touch. All the friends I've shown it to were surprised that I could only enter water. I now realise that I can enter other drinks, the only thing I can't enter is alcohol and as I'm a frequent glass of wine drinker it would greatly benefit me and I'm sure others to be aware of how much extra water needs to be drunk. Apart from that the app is wonderful and I've been using it for over a 2 months and have recommended it to many people. Thanks again, please do consider alcohol as most people do have a drink or two of an evening!!!",

It helps meet my goals in fun, informative and accurate ways. From the water notifications sounds, to the funny motivational background choices, self-start/end timers, the FYI reasons you must meet your water goals etc.!

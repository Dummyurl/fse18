Allow keyboard input and yours will be set above the rest (especially now that 2.0 has such an easy to use keyboard).",

Creating and saving notes on Wear works, sending them to phone works, but since typing on phone is much easier and faster, I'd like to do the opposite: to create notes on phone and send them to my watch. Without this function it's useless to me. If you could add this feature, I'll revise this feedback to 5 starts, I would also pay for a premium version because I truly need it.",

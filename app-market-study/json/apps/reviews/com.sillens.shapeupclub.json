But, when you search treadmill on he app to add your work out, it just asks for the time spent on the treadmill, but distance is just as important. I love every other aspect but I'm not sure how to keep track or how many calories I am truly burning on my work outs",

        "comment": "It's by far the best-designed app of its kind. Still looks in places like you guys were lazy and just ripped off the iOS design language - you could try to hybridise elements more, make it more integrated with Android's Material Design.  Content wise, it's full of useful and thoughtful things that don't make me feel like they take away from the simplicity of using the application for its primary purpose.   However, the number one gripe I have with this is its inability to export to CSV. There is a request logged for this you have not updated in 2 years! It's functionality that an intern can push out in half a day, unless your backend is horribly unstructured and more intense infrastructure work is needed.   This would be useful for quantified-selfers, people who hate proprietary databases, people with illnesses who need to keep a journal and show their doctor, data enthusiasts, so many people...   We are on Android, not in the closed garden that iOS is. Give us our data and I will give you 5 stars and recommend your app to my friends in the medical community.",

I like that it supports android auto, reads my music collection from the sd card, and has a reasonable simple-to-use interface. The only problem I have is that the recent version stopped keeping track of where I am in the default \"All Music\" playlist; I need to reselect it and start from the beginning every time.   2017-12-07 - It has stopped working with Android Auto. It freezes when I access the playlist menu. I'm using a MotoX Pure edition running Android 7.",

Few issues that I think that developer can fix and make this app better: 1) Not able to edit the created playlist. User can only create a new list, add more songs into the existing list or delete the list entirely. User should be able to remove songs from the existing list. 2) The \"repeat one\" function does not work properly, it stops playing after completing the entire song. 3) While resuming the app, it freezes occasionally.  4) My pending play list sometimes became empty while resuming the app.",

This sucks when driving and trying to listen to music.  I wrote another review previously, and the developer assured me that the issue had been resolved, and the app required an update, though as of yet, I am still yet to actually receive an update, and even when trying to contact the developer directly, have received no response, even after a month and a followup.  Definitely would give five stars IF the app worked as intended, and so far, unfortunately, at this time, I cannot give that, at least until there is an update provided.",

Exchange/Office 365 notifications are essential.  The setup UI has a steep learning curve, it's not intuitive.  Worth the effort.  Developer responds quickly.",

Being able to place information 'widgits' directly onto the watchface is a great feature so even if I miss a notification I can glance down and see it on the standard watchface.   The rain and weather notifications are extremely useful also!  The only features I'd like to see would be a black/white list for notifications from certain apps (One app I have sends lots of notifications with only a few key words for ones I actually care about), and a way to prevent rapid fire notifications (A cooldown time between notifications or vibrations if they come in fast).",

I SIMPLY NEEDED A WATCH THAT HAD A MORE BUSINESS LOOK TO IT. AND WHEN I SWITCHED TO THE ASUS ZENWATCH I WASN'T SO HAPPY. THE VIBRATION WAS SO WEAK I COULD HARDLY FEEL IT & NOTIFICATIONS WEREN'T VIBRATING. WELL.....AFTER BUYING YOUR APP EVERYTHING VIBRATES JUST THE WAY IT NEED IT TO! YOU SAVED ME A TRIP TO RETURN MY ASUS ZENWATCH!! I'M SO HAPPY & GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MAKE THIS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY ANDROID WEAR USER 100%! IT IS WELL WORTH THE VERY LOW COST! I SEE SOME OF THE REVIEWS SAY IT DOESN'T WORK WITH LOLLIPOP WHICH IS ROLLING OUT THIS WEEK. ARE YOU WORKING ON IT SO IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AFTER THE UPDATE MAKES ITS WAY TO ME????",

I'm sure it's helpful on other platforms too, for some needs.  Great app. Recommended.>>>>>  The lack of documentation made it very difficult to figure out how to use it with Pebble, but once I did, I encountered another problem. I now have multiple smart watches. It does different things with Pebble than the two Android a Wear watches, and while it's useful for Pebble I can't stop it from affecting Wear as well. It's also not quite what I want for my Sony SmartWatch 2. Any way to have it on for one watch but off for another? Five stars if I could use it for Pebble and not for Wear or SW2?",

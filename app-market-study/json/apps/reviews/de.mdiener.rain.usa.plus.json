Since it runs a visual sequence of the rain progression on my screen, I can estimate the time of the rain's arrival and not only that, I can see very easily if the clouds are growing in size or evaporating. Brilliant, just brilliant. Astonishing support from the developer too!",

        "comment": "Many thanks for the latest little update which restored the ability to set close ( 20km or less) alarms as we could in v4. The point about wanting to be able to set the alarm radius less then 15km is because I live to the north of a ridge of hills and the prevailing SW winds often mean the rain stays on the southern side of the hills and does not effect us. THANKS for listening and acting on your feedback reviews. SO good to have such a responsive developer!  (Earlier) Wonderful - just what I need on my phone, an alarm for rain.  The beauty of rain alarm has always been the immediate and local nature of the information - something normal weather forecast apps are not so good at.",

If you still get too many for your specific use case, I suggest you either decrease sensitivity in the alarm settings or apply the search sector (settings, alarm for main location, more).",

When opening my tablet it's on my homepage where I can always give it a quick glance especially when rain has been forecast and I've got washing on the line. The settings are very customisable and the alarm is a great help. Also the developer is always quick to answer any email requesting help. I'd give this gem 100 stars if I could.",

        "comment": "Reply 8/3/17: still haven't had any precip so impossible to test against actual rain and radar hasn't shown any false echoes the last few days so alarm hasn't gone off. My point is that the same radar images are being accessed by this new version as the previous version but now I'm getting inaccurate alarms or no alarms when there has been precip in the area. The search radius seems way too big even though I've set it to the minimum. This creates alarms for precip that don't even come close to my location. The sensitivity also seems off since v5 as occasionally no alarm will sound and precip had already begun. Like I said, I have been using this app for years so I'm pretty familiar with it's operation and this new version just doesn't work as good as the previous version for me. (end reply).  Since update to v5, I more than occasionally get alarms when there is no rain and none or inaccurate alerts when there is. Yes, the radar image will show a false echo for 1 frame - no precip here in the Seattle area for over a month - but this darn thing goes crazy for it. I've tried the default settings, my own trusted settings I have used for years (at least the ones I can correlate to the new settings) and wacky settings just to test with no appreciable differences. I basically just use it for the radar now as the intended functionality has been severely compromised and is no longer useful to me. Was my most used app by far. I wish I didn't upgrade.",

        "comment": "It's a well thought out idea and i like it.  But i feel prehaps you should be able to customize the vibrations on wear.  My email vibrates once and facebook is twice so I'm getting them confused.  Prehaps a more powerful vibration option as well for wear?  Its very good and helps keep track of time without constantly pulling out phone.  Well done",

        "comment": "Works perfectly with my Moto360, keeps my from time traveling. Especially useful when I need to be focusing on work. Much more reliable than using the interval timers on the store for the same purpose. One bug: the bottom half of the configuration app slightly overlaps the top half (OnePlus One with CyanogenMod 12, with on-screen nav bar enabled. if on screen nav is disabled or hidden its fine).",

All other apps and widgets work flawlessly on my phone.  I was hoping for a large widget of 3x3 or 4x4 as displayed in the picture not just a tiny 2x2.",

What I'd like to see is a less dense layout - no gradient or hour arrows in normal mode, and no twilight indicators in ambient mode - but it's very useful as it currently is.",

However:  It is a puzzling design decision (or just a bug) that evening hours around the edge don't honor 24-hour time display.  As I write this, the digital display says 14:52, but the hour hand is between \"2\" and \"3\".  Shouldn't the numbers also be in 24-hour time if I like to display the time in 24-hour?  As for feature enhancements, I would really like a minutes-hand and even a seconds-hand when not in ambient mode.  This face looks enough like an analog watch that my eyes keep searching for a minutes hand and not finding one.",

        "comment": "The app is not as usable as I expected. It has these features that I have use from one time use, which lead me my disappointment. I used LG R  1. Constant heart rate monitor (This will drain your battery around 30%/hr) 2. The Heart rate is totally just for display/monitoring. It would be best if it gets logged to Google fit so at least you would know your statistics on the workout. Since you wont really read the display constanly while doing something. By normal use you usually just go back to the data after doing the activity.  3. Create your workout. This part is confusing when you create initially. And don't make a mistake creating it since you cannot edit. The only way to do it is to delete the workout and start again. Big time sucks!  If not mistaken some of this disappointments comes from the watch build itself. Most times it will read inaccurate. I have been wearing a garmin watch with chest HR strap before and that one was pretty accurate. But this one I know my HR is around 140 but its reading 70. I believe the sweat and movements from the workout gets an inaccurate reading.  Given all of this,  - Not usable on real world scenario.  - I would like a refund!",

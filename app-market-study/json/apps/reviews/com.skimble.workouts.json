Also, you should add some pause with explanation of next upcoming exercise so I can prepare my self for it. Currently, next exercise starts immediately and I don't have enough time to prepare myself (take dumbbells, yoga mat or anything else). And the price should be cheaper than it is.",

        "comment": "Just started using app. It is way better and more functional, for what I was looking for, than any other app I have tried. Very convenient to set up a custom workout. Easy to reorganize to your liking by moving excerise up or down, changing time or reps and copying an excercise. The following are suggestions I would like to see in future updates. Quickly I hope. 1. Be able to add any single excercise found in app to a list. From my created list be able to move excercise to a workout. Currently you need to create a workout. I just want to start a database of excercises I am interested in and move them to where I want. 2. Be able to sort or move created workouts anywhere in the list. If you create a workout for say for Wednesday and then a create one for Monday, the first created workout is at the top of the list. It would be nice to be able to organize the created workout list in the order which you want it. 3. When creating a workout have more options on cover photos. Eg. Monday's workout is shoulders and back. Have pictures of muscle groups you can add as well as pictures of excercises. 4. Why does every created workout say legs under the cover photo? I cannot remove this. It is distracting if you want your workout to show a different muscle group or body part for that day. 5. To be continued. Developer feel free to send me an email \ud83d\ude0a",

        "comment": "I have been using this app for 5 years now. Reading through the reviews I feel most users do not understand all the options they have and the full potential this app offers. Tried several fitness apps, this is the one I stuck with. I train 5-6 days a week. Always with this app. I have created my own workout collections, programs etc on here. They even let you use your own photos and workout descriptions. A lot of workouts on there are free, but I still subscribe to Pro+, because I feel the  need to give back to this app. It has become the only social media platform for me now and my only fitness app. From Yoga to MMA to Crossfit, Tabata, Functional Training, Rock-climbing , weight lifting... You name it, they got it.. A great organizing tool, whether you're a beginner or Pro (like myself). Their admin support is awesome. I absolutely love it and I am fitter than ever, have made friends with great people, much of it thanks to this great workout tool.  Love this app!!!!",

And of the exercises I CAN find, they aren't as easy to setup as I would hope. For instance, I added Hack Squats (no exercise for the machine) but can't specify the weight to use. I can only use \"light,medium,heavy\" as opposed to \"25lbs,10lbs,etc\".  I also can't figure out how to easily do sets of reps. If I'm doing 4 sets of 12 reps before moving to the next exercise, how do I do it? It seems to revolve around one set of reps per exercise.",

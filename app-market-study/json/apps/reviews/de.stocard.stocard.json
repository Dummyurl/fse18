Works flawlessly providing the store has the right scanner to read the barcode. Otherwise it's a case of the till operator having to input the number manually. No big shakes though.",

It works well with the finger print scanner so a quick touch to unlock the phone followed by one touch to open the app and another to select the card. The only way to improve it is if it could tell you how many points you have earned on each card.",

I have asus zenwatch 2 running 1.4.  I have jorsay set with shake detection on with shake intensity high and detection duration 10 seconds.  I've also had it spontaneously read a text out loud 30 minutes after it was received.",

It would be nice if it would read the messages using your Android Wear speaker. I have a Huawei watch and this would be perfect. Please implement this!",

Also, you should have a feature that allows the user to enable this \"shake to\" service only when Bluetooth device is connected like headphones or a car, etc.  Give the user a choice of connected Bluetooth devices to choose.  At least make an activity \"start\" and \"stop\" service so it can be read by other apps like Trigger. I'd absolutely pay for an app that fulfilled the above requirements.",

I can't adjust where each individual element goes, but the Dev said that's something he'll work on in the future. The Dev is fast to reply, which is always amazing to see.  Development has been a little slow for a bit now is the only reason for 4 star.",

The only issue I have with it is that you can't pull the data into Tasker on the fly, you have to create a profile that has to be triggered for the variables to pass into Tasker. Smart Thermostat Plugin is much better for use with Tasker tasks, but doesn't include the widget or wear app. For the time being I guess I have to keep both.",

I have this widget displayed on my homescreen Tablet along with widgets that controls my lights and wifi cameras in the house. Boom!!

My initial review was not very good, and the developer contacted me to see if they could help.  After sending requested information to help troubleshoot, the issue was quickly discovered and an update to the app published within a couple of hours.  The issue has now been resolved and I couldn't be happier.  I am anxious to explore the functionality Calida provides the official Nest app does not.  The developer deserves a lot of credit for being so responsive, patient and willing to help.",

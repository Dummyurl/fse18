I love it, but can echo others with some sort of multi-touch zoom feature and also, a gallery view would be great as opposed to endless scrolling. I have over 500 photos in one of my phone photo albums and viewing with a 4 photo per screen or something to sort by date would be very useful for me. Great app though!! Keep up the good work and improvements.",

        "comment": "Highly recommend. Newton e-mail app is excellent with an excellent customer service. They help me, regarding some information I was looking for, with  solidarity  and efficiency and by the way just tap the icon of each e-mail account you got to open up the full features pertaining your e-mail account. Newton e-mail app is better than Maildroid an Aquamail(got the Pro or paid version of both). Newton runs smooth and fast, there's no issue with the app. Once a year they charge your credit card and I'm willingly to pay for this great e-mail app.",

        "comment": "I have used Newton for a year now, and now I hate it. The poor search capabilities when you have several email accounts is pathetic! If you are looking for an old email good luck ever finding it; Newton makes you many re-search and start over per individual account (I have 17) only to rarely ever find what you need or looking for; and even when I search using a complete email address, Newton returns the most rediculous unrelated results and from junk or totally irrelevant folders and email addresses.   Now the new bug really ended it for me! I'm done typing an important email, written perfectly, and then I go out of the app to copy some text, answer a SMS msg, whatever, (30 seconds) and upon returning back to Newton my entire email draft has vanished!!! Not to be found in the original thread marked as DRAFT or within any subfolders like \"Drafts\".  That's it, I'm quitting this half-baked approach to an email client!  You'd think for the subscription money a Company would at least make sure basic email usage was tested and fully vetted, not Newton and it's way out of the \"be patient I just released my 1.0 stage\", by now the app should be growing with new features and stabilizing.  Not Newton, it's now gotten worse and gone nowhere.  I've written and written support, to no avail.   I quit, going somewhere else to find a multiplatform email solution! Spend your money on a company that puts it back into development...IMHO anyways.",

It can also remind you if you don't get a reply to an email you send. I previously tried air mail and polymail and this is far better. For such a powerful tool it is worth every penny they charge. We pay a lot for other software, why should a good email client be any different! Take the trial, you won't turn back.",

Unfortunately, there's a problem with delayed syncing across all those devices, esp. if I don't use a particular device for a day or two (regardless if it's iOS, Android, Mac, Windows.)  It can take minutes to sync or even fail to fully sync unless I close and re-open the app to force another sync attempt.  Tech support says it's a known problem but the problem seems to have gotten worse over time.  Hopefully, they can resolve it soon.",

I have noticed the sync bug on Windows where it won't sync after being closed for a couple of days without closing and reopening. Please fix this issue. I also noticed that you can't copy an email address. Not being able to copy an email is very annoying and a little frustrating. I have to select forward for a message. Then, copy the email address from the message forward text in the new email. That's absurd. Please fix this issue (or add the feature).  Why am I still rating as 5 stars?   Because these issues are minor to me. I can live with them. The core functions and having a single app on all devices is most important. I am ok with the price, $50 per year and I am REALLY glad you don't make me pay monthly. I do not participate in monthly app subscriptions. If it's not annual I will not subscribe.  Overall, Newton is awesome!  I'm looking forward to additonal bug fix upgrades, especially on the Windows app.",

Hence, there is no sync interval provided. This is an optimal way of functioning which guarantees low battery usage. Furthermore, new emails are delivered to you instantly.",

And secondly, price is absurd. I was convinced that it's worth the price but no way I'll pay 50$ for an email app one shot. Congratulations, you played yourself.",

        "comment": "This is by far the simplest and most efficient way of combining all your email accounts for push notifications, with all the features you would otherwise pay for elsewhere i.e. read receipt / tracking, profile lookup. Inky is / was more expensive, Boomerang is still more expensive than this, and now they have a windows application.   Seriously, quit the beef over the cost, if you want a simple ubiquitous experience pay the cash. If not, move along.   Some things I would ask for are 1) being able customise and set default font and size etc... 2) more integrations such as Dropbox. 3) the ability to insert the signature (or remove it) from within the compose window. 4) A cloud web app would also be great.",

I stopped using it completely once they removed the free option. I recently came back to see if it was worth the cost, as it's the only mail app I've found that actually supports archiving mail from multiple accounts at once. However two things kept me from buying it. One, it's way too expensive and there is no option for monthly payments. Secondly, it doesn't even properly work like it used to. I will randomly not get email and things will randomly not send. So CloudMagic, this time it's goodbye for good.",

Even more valid when you are targeting business users. Take my money! Main problem for me however is the suboptimal handling of threaded e-mails which is a very common use case in enterprise environment. This makes the app rather useless for business. Removing two stars for the lack of development on that part and will leave my subscription expire. Will re-evaluate once this feature gets more attention.",

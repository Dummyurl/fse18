Bug in calculator that after clicking plus, then the first time I press decimal it doesn't register.  I have to always press decimal twice.  I have Google Pixel with all updates.  Update June 1 2017.  Terrible bug in calculator function that resets the number when typing a decimal.  No joke.  If you type 420.64 in the calculator, you'll end up with .64.  frustrating.",

You can just have a few currencies on screen or lots, it's up to you. Well worth the small fee I paid. Actually checked yesterday in town against several exchange rates and could see how much you get ripped off my buying other currencies. I wouldn't be without this App, espeacially as I  live in Thailand part of the year. Only thing I would love is a Text Alert. Great. Update on my review. Been using this app a while now. Excellent app. Would not be without it. Accurate when I was exchanging money in Thailand. Great app and worth every penny. 5 Star.",

Everything is working great except Logo Label is no longer showing any text, not even the default message. It's just a blank bar. Since this feature is not very important to me I have just turned the Logo Label off in the settings. I'm enjoying the watch face very much.",

I suspected this with NAVI, but it is very obvious on this watch face. I have tried tweaking the font settings, but that only affects the card text. I hope that something can be done. I am looking forward to showing this off at the 3rd annual Time Lord Party, lol",

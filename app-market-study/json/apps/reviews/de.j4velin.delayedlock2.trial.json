Will still leave 5 stars for those who can use the app.  Hope the developers can resolve issues that make it unusable on current phone.  Best, most useful application I've ever found. Amazing design with an impressive amount of very useful functionality. Paid for license since it's worth every penny!",

Many more fatures than smart lock too. Much better than the SkipLock app I was using on my last tablet with Android 4.4.4. The shortcuts are useful too. A very impessive app and impessively secure when using 'protect settings.'  Kudos to developer for a great app with a perfectly reasonable try-out period and a price that is more than fair for such a feature-rich and functional app.",

But It seems to work fine on Marshmallow (Android 6.0) on MotoG Rev2.  This is great since I really disliked the experience of using Android without Delayed Lock.  Damm!... Eventually it worked again with CynogenMod 13 on my WileyFox Spark+.. But was not aware it would break again with the Android 7.0 upgrade. Had I known I may have avoided the upgrade. Oh well - lets see if stock Android has caught up with this app. :( Nope it looks like it has not. There is no Wifi unlock and no \"keep unlocked for n minutes after use\"... Looks like I'm going to be typing my pin in all the time :(  Delayed Lock - You will be missed!",

After upgrading to android 6.0 I can use the app again but I have to disable finger print unlock and use a pin or password instead which defeats the whole security this phone offers. TL:DR don't bother if you own a  Samsung",

When I re-enter it, it will remember it for a variable amount of time - anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 days.  Update 9/19/15 - THANK YOU! This new update now works on my Samsung Note 4 running 5.0.1 - much appreciated. I've used this on my Note 3 and now on my Note 4. It has been seamless once I established the wi-fi and Bluetooth conditions to keep my phone unlocked in safe environments.  Update - no longer works at all with Lollipop upgrade.",

For about a week, it would not delay locking while in trusted WiFi even if I tried turning it off/on. Now it does not lock the phone, no matter where I am. I really really really hope this gets fixed. I like this app enough to buy it again if I had to and knew that would fix the issue.",

I normally don't run with a password but I like the idea of having one.  So this is the best of both worlds passwords when I need it, no password when I don't! Keep up the good work Dev, hope you keep supporting this app.  Just bought the full key",

This brilliantly designed app picks up on my chosen WiFi networks and does its job without any need for Location Services (and without any need for the offered free Location plug-in) on my phone, even though I am on a Moto E (2015) with the ornery Android 5.0.2 (Lollipop). No problem here, it turns out. Works perfectly on my home network and another (distant) network, and lets me leave the whole Location Services can of worms out of the picture completely.",

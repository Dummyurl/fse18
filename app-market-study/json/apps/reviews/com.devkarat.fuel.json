        "comment": "I installed this on my Galaxy S7 Edge for use with my Huawei watch and I love it. It''s beautiful and works great. I love being able to see my steps and the weather along with the battery level of both my phone and my watch right on the watch face. So cool and useful.  My brother also installed it on his Galaxy S6 Edge for use with his Huawei watch, and he also loves the features and the way it looks, but he's having a problem with it that I'm not having.  The Fuel watch face is causing heavy battery drain on his Huawei watch for some reason. Before switching to this watch face, he would have about 40% battery remaining at the end of the day when he took off the watch and put it on the charger. Wit the Fuel watch face, he is down below 5% battery remaining by the end of the day.  Does anyone know why this watch face would be causing such high battery drain on his watch?",

Step count was off by thousands,  no option to connect to Google fit?  Only interaction on the face is ability to change the color... Again, beautiful face, needs some work for $0.99",

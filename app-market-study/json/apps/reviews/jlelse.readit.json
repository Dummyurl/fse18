I tap the news tile, then choose sources, and then... nothing happens at all. I haven't seen any articles in 3 hours of tapping things over and over and over again. There are other things about that I wanted to point out that would make it a better app, but without any actual news showing up what is the point?  2 stars because the design seems nice enough, but there are definitely some design issues, and a news reader should probably have some news. At least, I would think. Maybe I'm wrong. Paperboy is still King of the News Readers. Just get that one.",

I don't really care about source but the articles and by utilizing tiles that cannot be reordered, that just make users further away from the articles.. Also it'd be better if I can toggle the full article icon thing by default and not tapping it every time and also changing the size of the fonts..",

It's 99 cents for 3 months to unlock the pro features but no mention as to what they are. Maybe the articles? There's also a mysterious button that says it's only available to pro users.

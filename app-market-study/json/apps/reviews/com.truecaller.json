Rather than backing up everything, it would be better to have an option for selecting what to backup. A lot of people already use Google Contacts for contacts. So, the only thing left to backup is call log, block list and SMS log. It would be nice if this feature is implemented. Also, it would be really nice to have backup over WiFi and an option to select what precise time the backup happens. It keeps using my mobile data always as the backup happens around 17:00 and I'm outside at that time.",

I don't use WIFI on my phone much and even if I did, it would only be at home. This app will however tell you who is calling after you ignore it. You can call back if it's not a spam caller.",

App is awesome.  **UPDATE 26 FEB 2018*    I've kept this app and have grown comfortable with it. I've been able so somewhat identify a frequent secret caller who always hangs up (I know the name associated with the number now, but I'm sure it's a spoofed number and a fake name. When I dial back it's always an error that the call can't be placed as dialed even though I pressed callback, and the name is just a three word phrase with no spaces) I'd like a better answer but it's better than nothing). All around this app is excellent and I intend to keep it as long is it's available. Thank you guys so very much. I've already told people about you. If any app should come pre installed on your phone it's this one.",

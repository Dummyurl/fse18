If I upgrade and don't like it, it won't be a good because it's in app purchase, making it difficult to refund. The best I can give this is 3 stars based off the free versions capabilities. Considering that all you can see is the calendar with no other function, and that there are free versions that offer even a little function, its a pretty generous rating.",

        "comment": "The premium version allows for agenda viewing which I really like, however on the moto 360 the event name is not fully visible unless it is dead center at the widest point of the screen.  A simple fix would be to tab over the events for the moto just a few places to keep them in view longer.  A really cool fix would be to have the event follow the contour of the screen as you scroll! A full 5 star rating when fixed,  thank you! Also,  having more colors to choose from and/or different colors for each month.",

But, after removing and REINSTALLING the app on my tablet the PAID FEATURES ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE. What? This is simply wrong, in my opinion very wrong. The extra features should be available to unlock as a separate paid app so I can reinstall this app without paying again. Summary: THIS IS A TERRIBLE APP, JUST LIKE STEALING YOUR MONEY FOR EXTRA FEATURES. DO NOT BUY PREMIUM FEATURES.",

But Gary Shook has a good suggestion to add steps counter in place of the battery percentage. Since the bars on the side show both phone and watch battery or if they do not perhaps label them respectively allow for that. It's a great watch face very pleased with it. Like the look of it very futuristic. Thanks.",

I have a Samsug Galaxy S5. Thanks, best dial I have ever seen. I have been a timepiece fanatic for decades(particulary automatics) and love now that I can replicate anything I want with software and LCD. Your app is what prompted me to buy a smart watch. I just came across the app randomly and was immediately sold. Thanks! Any help appreciate",

He has so many incredible designs. I can't help myself and switch them up constantly. If you have issues check his website/instructions first... if that doesn't work he is an EXTREMELY responsive developer. Two thumbs up and a Word Up to Tha PHLASH for some awesome designs.",

The only thing it's missing that would make it perfect is a step counter.  Please add one!  Maybe replace the digital battery readout and add a step counter there?  Or at least let it be an option?

        "comment": "This is the best looking watch face i have seen! That being said though, i have a couple of gripes with it. If hands are shut off, their shadows still show. Also, if you reset the phone or watch you have to redownload to get the weather and phone battery % to work again. And the face has no interactivity or function when pressed besides changing the battery display from watch to phone %. For the price i expected to at least be able to access extended weather menu by pressing the watch face.",

Kudos to who ever fixed the issue. Whether it was Asus fixing their app or PHLASH! It's the prettiest face in town. ;)",

For example the right hand gauge and digital representation is set to display the watches battery level but for some reason it keeps switching to display the phones battery level. I have checked the settings and all is correct there, it just seems to have a mind of its own. Secondly, there is a noticeable lag from when the screen activates to when the 'full' watch face is displayed.",

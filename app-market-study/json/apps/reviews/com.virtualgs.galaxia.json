You press the sides of the screen for the ship to go in that direction & keep on moving as well as firing. Press the middle bottom of the screen to stop moving/stay still & fire. Give the game a bit of a chance before reveiwing. If youre looking 4 something more mid90's shootemup try \"space war (android wear)\".",

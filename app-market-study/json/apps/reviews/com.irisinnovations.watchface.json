Your problem may be a common one for Android Wear watch faces -- there is an arbitrary delay between installing on the mobile device and syncing to the android wear device. I've seen as long as about 5 minutes, assuming the watch is connected correctly. Hopefully this was your issue and it has resolved itself by now.",

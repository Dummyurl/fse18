        "comment": "Okay, in short it's great. But a few things. Even though it has family buying available, my own tablet seems to need to purchase it, even though I've bought the full version? Furthermore, the Android TV app is buggy. It can't access video first time round, but if you leave the app, and go back in, it reverts back to a phone mode and it works, but the whole UI is screwy as it's the phone version,  I've lost the nice looking TV UI. As well as that, the picture  I in picture mode doesn't work. Ionly bring this up because you seem to respond to reviewers, which I think is awesome, so maybe you could fix these things? Even if you didn't, still a solid app! If you did fix these, it'd be a five star from me as it really is nice",

The connection works well, I love that you can download your own lullabies and control them from the parent station. One thing I will say that holds me back from 5 stars is when I turn on the video from the parent station, the volume of the lullaby playing on the baby station BLASTS out loud usually waking the little one. Both apps are up to date on both devices. But other than that definitely worth it! I love that you can have multiple parent stations too! Even from work my husband can tap in to see the little one schnoozing.",

Paid for the app on my MacBook and still have to pay for it again to use it on an iPhone which has the same Apple account details as the MacBook which I think is unfair as it's both the same platform. Had to buy for Android, MacBook and now have to buy for iPhone when it's all the same app and company. Glad to give 5 stars if these things are rectified. Thanks",

The feature allowing us to turn on and off the light on the tablet was fantastic for night time.  We have already recommended this app to many people - a \"must get\" for travelers with kids!",

        "comment": "Great substitute for the $100+ monitors you can buy at the store.  It works seamlessly between Apple and Android devices.  We love it, but after using it for over a year, I have found a few things to be aware of: -Be close to a power source. This thing will DRAIN your mobile battery.  I installed the app on my Mac to save my cell battery the abuse.  -Make sure you have reliable Wi-Fi. The monitor only works when connected to the internet and we've had a few cases where we lost connection and woke up to the baby screaming from down the hall (poor kid!) -I JUST learned this today and it's what prompted me to write the review- THE APP SAVES ALL ACTIVITY!  Every time you start monitoring it records every noise made and saves it to your devices memory.  There is no auto-delete setting. I found this because my phone mysteriously ran out of memory and I found 2 GB of it was used by EVERY SINGLE SOUND the baby made on the monitor over the last year.  Devs, if you're reading this , PLEASE patch with a \"delete activity log after __ days\" setting!  If you don't mind dealing with this sort of stuff, this is a great app substitute for traditional monitors. We love running the Parent Station on multiple devices, being able to check in when we leave him with a sitter, or keeping it running if we're working outside while the baby naps.",

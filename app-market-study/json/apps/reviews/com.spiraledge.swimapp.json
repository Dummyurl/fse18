So far it gets the distance correct most of the time, unlike Speedo On or S Health, but it does not always detect my strokes correctly (Samsung Gear Sport). I get freestyle or unknown. At least I can edit this on the website and in the app (took me a while to find out how). Also the app is very slow to load each section. Looking forward to updates.",

I am using a Nixon Mission with android wear 2.0, my hardware button works for theater mode but the app does not start if the display setting is not at always on. I can not change the yards to meters on the watch but can fix this with phone app. Still it is anoying. I tried it in 4 different day none count the whole labs the best was 10% off, it counts the srokes etc. but miss a turn and adds all the remaining turns as a single lap. Finaly ftom a computer I managed to add my watch to phone app but now I have nixon and android watch saperetly and only the android watch works if I try the nixon icon it opens a web describing how to transfer data from a germin watch. Hope some of these can be fixed in upcoming updates. I especially need an accurate lap count and meter option selectable on the watch.",

Surprisingly I can still put the watch into theater mode despite what official support site says - with two presses of the button. I've done three swims so far. Sad to say, the tracking's been a total mess. Using the app to merge intervals and laps, I've managed to fix one workout, but was forced to delete two workouts which were unfixable (where I swam the speed of an Olympic champion, or across the lap in 3 strokes).  EDIT 15/9 - Discovered that the previous problems was due to swimming with hand paddles. If I swim without hand paddles, the tracking seems to detect the laps and strokes pretty accurately (tested across 3 swim sessions), and only gets the intervals wrong which is fixable in the app later. So now I am forced to swim without hand paddles in order to get my tracking data correctly.",

This app keeps crashing consistently on my phone, whenever I open \"Deivces\" submenu to upload my swimming data from Sony Smartwatch 3. I have also noticed crashes on my watch some times while swimming. I created a support ticket. Initially it was dealt by some support guy, later no response from them.  Good app, only if it works :(",

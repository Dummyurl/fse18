        "comment": "This is very useful when you don't have WiFi or mobile data signal for OK Google. Used in conjunction with Wear mini launcher it is very convenient. However, I would like an optimised version for round watch face (LG G watch R) - probably just requires slightly smaller icons! I'd also like to see the dialer as a right swipe action rather than at the end of the contacts! I was a bit surprised at the price, but I paid it so you got me. But otherwise just what I was looking for.",

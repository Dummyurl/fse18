        "comment": "It really works off line!  I used this in New Zealand and my phone doesn't work there but this app worked great off line. What you had to do was start the day off with your phone on wifi. Open the app and make sure your GPS locator is on. Using the app map go over your day's route so it will be in then phone's history. You're good as gold. When you open the app far from home, the locator finds you on the map and gives you the information it has stored. It's magic.  For app use where I live, I find it better than the other apps. While the other apps I have used rely heavily on familiar 'fast food' outlets as the sole location in an area, this app found lots of the free public ones, like parks and shopping centers.  I also found it was real easy to add locations into the data base. So hopefully users can improve the knowledge base. Having used in extensively in New Zealand and around my home in the US, I was pleased with how many locations were in the data base. It even knew of bathrooms that were off the beaten track in rural NZ, even backcountry hiking areas. No app can know all the free and easy bathroom locations, but for me this did a better than fine job.",

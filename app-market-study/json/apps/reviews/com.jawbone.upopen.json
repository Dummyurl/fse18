The app is paired with the band, it seems to be working, but nothing shows. None of my steps! Can you please explain why this is happening? Is UP not providing support anymore?",

Only 4 stars because food tracking can be cumbersome and tech support seems to focus on tracking devices. (While the FAQ is great and thorough, I'm not sure whether contacting support about further issues with the app is appreciated - \"UP App\" is a subcategory of the tracking devices on the contact form, and I got a kinda canned response to a bug report).",

My UP2 strap eventually broke so I've glued it to a latex wristband and it's still working fine.  Not had any sync issues with my android phone for months.  I'll continue to use UP as long as I can.

It's unfortunate that Jawbone is discontinuing hardware development, but assures that software updates will continue.  As others have stated, there is no continuous HR feature.  I only use the sleep and activity trackers in the app.  If I was trying to lose weight, I would use the calorie portion as well.  The app is a great motivator for me and I use it daily.",

I pair it with 'Myfitnesspal'.  of you want a tracker that doesn't look like a computer strapped to your wrist this is a good choice. Previously support was by phone, instantaneous and great. now it is only by email.  good but not as great, hence resting of 4 instead of 5.",

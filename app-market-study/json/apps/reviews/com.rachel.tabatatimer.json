        "comment": "I am able to use this app however it is very user unfriendly. The following must be improved:  1. Start/Stop button. The app will start counting down time immediately when opened  2. Worst of all if I do not constantly touch the watch the app face disappears and my watch face (normal time) appears, whilst the app works in the background. This totally disables me from focusing on my workout.  Finally user interface should be improved. Before reading the app update I never knew I could customize the timings and cycles etc.",

Would be great to have a graph to see how the pressure is while driving to get more data. Real time upload to mobile sync would be awesome. But overall it's an excellent device ad a definite need to ensure safety.",

Some little kid stole one of them as well (looked on cctv), you can easily unscrew them by hand even if you tighten them up with the included tool. Overally this product has been a complete waste of money for me, have taken it off the car and will probably bin it, good idea but flawed in execution.",

This review however is for the app.  The app itself was failed in many respects.    1) i can only have 1 device logged in at a time.  I can authorize other e-mails to view the data, but only 1 device per e-mail.    2) app failed to add the main unit many times, and tire sensors a couple of times.     3) no widget for app to display tire pressure without opening app.    4) app runs in foreground and displays a notification 24/7   On a final note, i increased this review from a 2 star to a 4 star due to customer service.  This review got a quick response which is rare these days.  I still think the app could use improvements, but customer service is greatly appreciated.",

The worst part is your distributor don't even care to troubleshoot for me. My question now is \" is your product reliable in the first place ?\" Frankly speaking, took me almost 5 mins everytime for me to pair with my phone. I was wondering is my S6 having problem?",

The Weather Alert notification is a bit annoying though, as it always states Bright Weather as the notification (which is the app name) but it doesn't display the alert reason.... so it just reads as WEATHER ALERT: BRIGHT WEATHER. The other notifications are more informative, would be great if you can summarise the weather alert to fit in the notification title too.",

It's like that for both my nexus 5 and 10. It doesn't correct itself on its own like other apps. Is there something going on that I can correct other than manually refreshing it? At times even a manual refresh doesn't work. Thanks for your time.",

It looks nice but it needs to be more clear. It has also been freezing up on me lately but not too often.  Also it is seems a bit slow to update.",

I don't know where Bright Weather gets its data from but the forecasts are always more accurate then the other apps I use, and accuracy is what its all about in my opinion. Add  to that a great user experience and I give this app 5 stars.  One thing I would like is to get a more detailed description for today's weather without being redirected to a website, would prefer it was embedded within the app.",

It is a pity though that German umlaut signs cannot be displayed correctly, these weather texts will bring up cryptic signs which are impossible to read.

And there parents and family are still over here in the states.",

I love video calling him. Can you please fix the issues with the camera? When I video call him sometimes I wanna show him threw my camera, but I can't because my camera goes on and off randomly, and there is no indication of this. The only way to know is if the person ur calling tells u. We both have Android phones and it happens to both of us. Plz fix it",

If Allo makes available the stickers found in Hangouts, even if it's done just through the gboard app. Along with the read receipt within a chat be the profile picture concept over the check marks.

You get alerted for EVERY SINGLE MESSAGE either in a group chat or from an individual, with no smart setting to make it only alert you for the first unread new message.

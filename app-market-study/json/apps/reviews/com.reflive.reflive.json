        "comment": "Hello!  This looks like a fantastic app.  I am not able to send a match to my phone.  I touch the \"Send to Phone\" link.  Then I confirms that it will overwrite existing matches on the phone.  Then it gives a message at the bottom that it is moving the match to the phone.  But...nothing shows up on my phone.  I am using a Polar m600, which I believe comes with Android Wear 2.0.  I am able to get other apps to work.  (Nevermind ...I just figured it out)  With Android Wear 2.0, the user needs to manually install the app on the watch in the Google Play app once it's already on your android phone.  Request...I'd still like to be able to add player numbers on the fly on the phone in case a player arrives after kickoff.",

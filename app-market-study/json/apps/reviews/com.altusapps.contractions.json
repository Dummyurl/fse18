If you're planning on timing on an Android Wear device, note that you have to keep the app running (not enough just to have it installed) on a connected device (e.g. phone), otherwise you'll get a \"Connection failed\"-notification. Might be nice to have it start / stop the app on a connected device from your Android Wear device if it isn't running yet..?",

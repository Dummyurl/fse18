Easy install but the video takes forever to load as other reviewers state. I'm not getting notifications of motion or sound - kind of the whole point of a baby monitor. The product does not make me free safe and comfortable while baby sleeps and I'm downstairs. Will be returning product immediately.",

I can typically stream video for about 5-10 seconds before one of the above occurs.

        "comment": "I must say i like this cam very much! Honestly, after reading the reviews here, which were all mostly negative, i was a little affraid, but now after i got it really don't understand such complains... sure its not a perfect cam, but image quality i great, zoom capability is awasome, noise alerts work, air quality feature is super! i can only conclude that the people who complain probably have weak devices, i mean when you have streaming apps on your phone you have to expect to have a device that has a high standard on hardware, this is normal you can`t expect to have the same performance in a low spec phone as in a samsung s8... this is probably why people that have an iphone don't complain, its a high spec.phone. I personally own a xiaomi mi5, its a high spec phone with very fast processor and integrated powerfull graphics processor. Dev team, my congratulations to you for a great job, good reviews are also a goos incentive to keep up the good work i guess ;) There are for sure some bugs, sometimes the image turns black, not often but happens, if i go to settings and come back to live it seems it reload so my suggestion would be for you include a refresh option while on image mode, this would help a lot. The design is beautiful, i would enjoy personally to have it with battery, maybe in the next model!  Thanks again!",

        "comment": "SGS7 Edge.   - Black screen after 5 seconds of live stream. - Unable to connect after restoring from background (after reset it connects). - Live stream freezes and never restores - Air quality not always work - showing just a leaf icon that do nothing (after reset it works).  Camera hardware is ok, quality and idea behind it is great, iOS app is much better (basically it works).  For now this application is really a deal breaker for Android users, it makes huge damage to the great product and Nokia brand. I have few Withings (Nokia) devices, all are perfect apart from this application. If you guys are struggling with resources, time or whatever, give your customers information - should they wait, return product or switch to iOS for now, as this app is not working, was obviously never tested, and should never been published.  Dear Nokia, this app is not a rocket science, if you need any help fixing this, please let me know.",

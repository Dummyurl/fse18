        "comment": "This entire platform is inconsistent. Some days it works great, other days you won't even get push notifications to the watch from any app whatsoever. It can, in theory, function as a media remote (sometimes), but that's only with Spotify and only when the app chooses to function. The Play Music app just wants to attach to Wi-Fi thus defeating any usefulness it has to control the actual device its paired with.  In short, get an iPhone and get an Apple Watch if you want a hands free life with a wearable.",

This issue is not manufacturer related, please check other people's comments on the net (literally thousands are having the same issue). It is due to the fact tha Android Wear app is not holding the bluetooth internet sharing service or something for the watch. When restarted, it works for a while. Please, solve it, you are the smartest people. Thanks Connectivity is a serious issue. As thousands of other people, I have a problem with bluetooth internet sharing (for Android Wear smartwatch) disconnecting without reason.

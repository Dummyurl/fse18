Example: When I receive a BBM message the InformerWear card pops up on my watch and I have a option to respond via the Mic icon,. after I record my message the text box dissappears so I tap on the green \"check\" icon which I assume sends the reply and closes the card?  Nothing ever gets sent I'm noticing.  I've tried this on two separate androidwear watches, one with AW1.5 the other with AW 2.0.  Am I  using the reply function properly??

        "comment": "The app itself deserved 4-5 stars. I'll say that right up front. But... the pricing structure to fully enable the app is just ridiculous. I am always one to buy apps. Support developers! Even if it's an app that works fine as free, I still usually do the in-app purchase or buy the paid version if I really like the app. This one though - $10? It's an excellent add-on for messaging on your watch.but $10 in the app world puts it up there with an Exchange email client like Nine. Full featured launchers don't cost $10. The 99 cent subscription model makes no sense. Why would this be a subscription app?  A developer can charge whatever they want but I can have an opinion. Placing the full feature set under such an out of line price detracts from the app. I bet more people would buy it if it were priced under $4. More people paying probably leads to more money than a few paying $10. I just can't bring myself to pay that. I hope the developer rethinks the price. Then, I might buy it.",

No outline style subcategory levels here  -  it allows plain one level list making, re-ordering items is possible by checking as 'done' then unchecking to move to base of list. I'd appreciate a less long-winded way to re-order items. But good, it neatly allots each list its own tab as new lists are made. I'll try a few competitors before I revisit this critique. My main sniff is that this does what a paper list can do, but re-ordering would take it  a bit further.",

        "comment": "I needed a list app for my Android Wear watch, and this one does what I need. I love the simplicity in design. A few tweaks would get 5 stars from me:  (1) I need a setting to let me choose whether the list is sorted alphabetically or by (the current default) most-recently-changed. If I maintain this as a grocery list, then as the list gets longer it will be harder to find things in the checked-off section and put them back in the unchecked section.  (2) I need longer persistence on the Android Wear device. As it is, the list vanishes quickly, and I have to reload it repeatedly as I make my way through a store -- greatly diminishing its convenience and utility.  (3) Separate colors for individual lists (rather than a single color for all of them) would help me distinguish lists at a glance more easily.  Thanks for the work you've done so far.",

Wal-Mart, Smith's and Dollar Tree store) and  make my list and see quickly what I need from a certain store from my shopping lists. Easy to open and use app once installed into your phone.

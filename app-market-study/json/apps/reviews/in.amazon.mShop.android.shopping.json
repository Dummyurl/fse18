I have stopped buying high value electronic item.   Further, why don't you guys improve your app. User interface is really poor. Filter doesn't work properly.",

Details of each product with pics, reviews, questions/answers. 6. 'Amazon prime' which I've not tried as I think it can't provide fast delivery to our area ( with India post - the only available courier service here) 7.Delivery by India post are slow as hell, it atleast takes 12/14 days. It takes 3 days to reach Guwahati from Haryana and atleast 8 days from Guwahati(781006) to Majuli(785105)!!  8. Easy return/exchange not available in our area (it's to be self returned). 9. False product delivered for a number of times, lots misguiding product details. ***Still the best online shopping service in the world. Thanks!",

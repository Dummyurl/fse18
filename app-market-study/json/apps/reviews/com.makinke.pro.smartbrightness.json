        "comment": "So, I've been testing this app for the past few days and while it definitely works as stated, it also seems to kill my Moto 360's battery! I've tested it: one day installed, one day uninstalled, one day installed, and so on, then compared battery stats. Without this app installed my battery drop can be as low as 1.5% per-hour, with it installed it can be as high as 8.12%! It's a shame as it does seem to fix the dodgy stock auto-brightness. Has the potential to be a great app!",

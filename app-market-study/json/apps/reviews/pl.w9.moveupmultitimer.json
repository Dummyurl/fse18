        "comment": "I live by this app. I use it multiple times a day. I set a 25 minute timer to remind me to look away from the screen for a few seconds. I swipe this one away and have no issue with it.  I set a second timer to move away from my desk every 50 minutes. I have this set to the walk dismissal. My problem is that the step detection is very unreliable. About a third to half the time I have to reboot my android wear watch because the timer just won't detect all the steps and dismiss. Perhaps a workaround could be to add a \"no really, I have actually walked, trust me\" dismissal option?",

An option to adjust notification priority (card vs full-face), per alarm, would be a welcome addition as well. Otherwise, the app works as intended, and quite worth upgrading to premium.",

I don't think they should expire.  I spend approx $1200 a month and you have to spend $1000 to get $1.00 off for gas.  I feel I have earned those points and should be able to keep them.  Maybe you can change your policy to no more than $1.00 off a gallon at one time.  Thank for allowing me to give my opinion.",

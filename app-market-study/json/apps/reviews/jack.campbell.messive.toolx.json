        "comment": "Update 8 Mar 2016. Still using this app a lot and it's really great. One wish though. Would it be possible to have a dynamic vertical axis range when looking at the barometric graph? The reason being that changes in pressure between 900 hPa and say 1030 hPa don't really show much at all on a graph with scale range 0 to 2000. Still a great app, though this would make it perfect!",

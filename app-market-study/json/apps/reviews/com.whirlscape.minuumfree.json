I've always used swipe style keyboards because I'm so sloppy at hitting keys. Imagine making beautiful music on the piano- using your fists.  That's Minuum.   It's creepy cool.  You just gotta be patient and realize it's just a QWERTY.  Try it for a week. It will blow your gourd. Do it just for the entertainment.",

It just removes the need for vertical tapping, and the predictions are astounding. It even guesses things like my crazy email address. Pro tip: use the clipboard for easy access to passwords.",

I have recently just changed phone to a galaxy note 8. The note 8 has software nav buttons at the bottom. After a while of short use, the spacebar and bottom of the keyboard becomes hidden under the navbar and the only solution is to use a different keyboard.   Please address this issue in the next update so I can keep enjoying this fantastic app. Thanks and excellent work.",

Being able to swipe keys to get secondary characters instead of holding down a key (which interrupts the typing flow) is a feature ALL keyboards should have. I just wish you could swipe up for capitals, and swipe down for the secondary characters. The other gesture features are great too. This isn't my primary 3rd-party keyboard, but it's growing on me and may take the #1 spot soon.",

Typically I'm a sworn swipe typer, but the sacrifice of not having that option with this one (makes sense though due to the way the keyboard layout is heavily condensed) it's totally worth it! It's great having all the extra screen real estate back that gets wasted by some of the other keyboards that don't let you resize them too much. Can't wait to see what new features they can come up with.",

Gestures make deleting and whatnot pretty easy, though they by necessity preclude any swipe-to-type style input. The smart punctuation is pretty on-point, allowing the predictive text to function as it should (treating the different words between dashes, say, as different words, instead of just giving up on them like other keyboards).    Now, why remove a star? Several reasons. 1) The theming is kinda weak. Namely the color selection. I want more than just pastels, ya know? This is my main gripe. I WANT A REAL ORANGE COLOR! 2) The lack of some features I've come to enjoy, like searching for gifs straight from the board. Fleksy kinda spoiled me there. This one's pretty minor.   Other than that? It's pretty fantastic. A truly great, and novel, keyboard, and well worth the slightly high asking price for pro. I don't see myself using something else for a while to come.",

Unfortunately, I recently bought a new pixel 2 and this app keeps crashing and stalling, so I'm assuming it's got compatibility issues. I got my money's worth out of it and hope it's supported again in the future. Great product.",

You can shrink it down to the size you'd use with one finger on a phone, so typing is really fast, and, unlike every other keyboard I've tried, it then doesn't occupy the whole width of the screen. You can float it around and put it wherever you want, and as it's semi-transparent you can still see what's under it too.. And if you switch on the bonus panel you can set it to display arrow keys across the bottom of the keyboard. I find them really useful for adjusting the cursor position in very small fonts.",

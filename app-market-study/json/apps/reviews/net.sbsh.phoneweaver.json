Stable, reliable and trouble free. Location function is more versatile in Easy Profile Pro. I tried most of the other paid similar applications, and found Phone Weaver to be practically useful in every day life. You may also try similar ones- Actions Pro for example. PLEASE ADD MOTION DETECTION TRIGGER with Time delay.",

        "comment": "Phone Weaver was the first and, for a long time, only app I purchased for Android. I liked the using the calendar sync (\"Agenda\") to mute/unmute when I was in meetings, and especially the app's ability to turn on wifi when I arrive home - and off when I leave, to save battery. It lost the ability to access any of my location services, and Smart Actions, as awful as it is, seems to work more reliably for the things that it does. I sent an email to Sesma support, and the person who responded seemed to be trying to tell me how to turn GPS on, in my device; provided no other options. (I know how to turn on all my location services.) If location access is restored this will get 5 stars.",

It worked great on my Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 but recently on my Nexus 6 and recent Android updates it's lost its stability.  The phone basically locks up when switching to navigation when I'm in my car. Instead of making it easy for me to answer calls, view my maps and send and receive text via voice commands it pretty much becomes inoperable. I have to reboot, disable the app, set my screen timeout to the max... all while driving to my destination.  Sorry Phone Weaver but I had to uninstall you. Unless they fix the app I'll have to look for an alternative. :(",

A little time consuming to set up, but I like all the options. 11/17/14 UPDATE: Just updated, will check back to see if the update keeps me happy. 1/17/15 update,  everything except Automatic triggering is working.  Won't change at set times in Android 5.01",

Have been using for years until author tried to fix when its not broken. Forced to uninstall and use alternative free apps which work better. Latest update still needs WiFi and will turn it on momentarily but still does not work.",

Turn sound profiles up and down based on time, day of week, calendar entries...  have used to keep late night email and text from waking me, but still able to get phone calls and switches back every morning.

        "comment": "UPDATE: the developer responded and found that my anomaly only happens on the LG G Watch. He's working on it. 4-stars for quick response. 5 if I like it when it's finished :-)  So, as he told me, Stay Tuned...   As I discovered, and the description says, I can use \"OK Google\" and tell it what I want, and XTimer will respond. So, \"OK Google, Set a 22 minute and 30 second timer\" will kick off a timer to time who knows what... Or cares, right?   Give it a try, if you have a G Watch, and if you can't use the Timer on your watch, and it's not a G Watch, please post a quick comment (which will work until there are so many downloads the dev can't keep up with comments).",

I've now pushed \"release1c\" of XStopwatch & XTimer, which works around the problem and should operate correctly on all wear devices. You should receive this update on your device soon.",

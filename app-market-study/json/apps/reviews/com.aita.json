But the latest update of the app became unnecessarily complicated and busy. There are about 2 dozen tabs you have to navigate through and all for things like reviews of airports that are old and dated that are pulled from Google that are completely useless when you're literally just trying to grab quick info about your flight. Most of the tabs that will notify you of anything important require a subscription. The app displays a number of timelines and so forth but none are accurate as they are not updated until after your flight is already over. So unless you love looking at info on flights you've taken to feel nostalgia, this flight has no great value.",

Several years ago many personal assistants were 'internet addicted' and require internet connection to provide up-to-date flight data. AITA was first app with two ways of delivering information over internet and via SMS. The last case is much helpful if you're in roaming. Just imagine, you have a lot of applications each of them is going to spend your roamed internet while you're sitting and starring into assistant to know if any flight gate changes happen or not. Receiving SMS is usually cost-free in roaming even but absolutely has another price if you need to get flight information or share them with your friends and family. Since subscription appeared in app I moved to paid version without doubt to obtain all features were free in the beginning and still on it!",

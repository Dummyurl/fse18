Love that I can take a sweaty selfie immediately after it tells me how much calories I just burned and what it is equal to. Today I burned the equivalent of a scoop of vanilla. :)",

Doesn't log my workout,  dosent log goals,  won't let you add weights to your work outs, gives ludicrously low numbers for calories burned, doesn't count reps using a smart watch on the list. I do like the exercises,  but the not logging my work puts is really starting to get to me. I want to love this app but it's performance is making that hard",

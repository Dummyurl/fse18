        "comment": "I was expecting this app to set a shortcut to the active screen/app so that I could swipe it open whenever I wanted. Instead it is used to keep open whatever app you have in the foreground, even if the screen goes off so it loads up straight away. Useful when you want to save battery and not have to load up the same app time after time but if you could turn the swipe gesture into a sort of favourite shortcut launcher it would be great. The app design otherwise is very neat and good looking.",

It is the only watch face I could find showing the year which was a great addition. I am also very impressed with the color selection options of the watch. All in all a great purchase and app.",

        "comment": "I love this watch face. It gives me time and full date, plus a couple of timers that I can use without losing my clock function. Easy to change intervals for the interval timer. I use timers when I play poker to keep track of my time at the table and blinds, if I'm in a tournament. A battery status and heart rate monitor are just a bonus. I find heart rate monitor not very accurate on my Moto 360, but I understand that it is not the watch face software issue, it is the hardware that it is running on. Hopefully, on the Moto 360 Gen 2 this will work better.",

        "comment": "Wanted a quick working app that runs on my Android Wear watch before a presentation at work, so after it didn't do anything I promptly uninstalled it. Once I got home I tried it again and after some research it's got it to work!  I got confused at the beginning, because I didn't know that it uses Apple Script. It would be worth mentioning that and that you can get a dictionary for any app on a Mac (Google 'Spotify AppleScript dictionary'  for more details). Still trying to figure out how to display a toast after clicking the info question mark. Any thoughts?   It would be great if you could add support for the most commonly used apps like Spotify, Keynote, Powerpoint in the app out of the box (tweakable to change the default settings).  The direct Bluetooth connection would be handy too.   In general it's a great idea. Love the app! Keep up the good work! We, the people, are out there wanting more!",

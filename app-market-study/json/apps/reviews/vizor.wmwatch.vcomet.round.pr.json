Whilst it is a current limitation with the Watchmaker platform, it'd be nice if I didn't have to keep setting it back to 12 hour mode after each watch restart or face change. I've left feedback to that effect on the Watchmaker Premium app. Looking forward to more from this dev.",

For those with a Moto 360, like me, compass is useless because our device does not have one. You could release the result  like update and you will get 5 *****. I can also pay for a specific Moto 360 version with that change. No need to refund the current one. Hope you can make it. Thanks.",

        "comment": "the best watch face I've found so far. Suits my LG Urbane perfectly. icons are easily distinguishable which makes it easier to read the watch with a quick glimpse. Compass is perfect and very useful for me. I have a few suggestions. It'd be great if you can implement them. I am ready to donate a modest amount and 5 stars :) It's very smart to have different sections for different categories such as weather, fitness and calendar. Can you integrate the following: Missed calls and unread messages in the calendar section with tiny interactive icons next to the calendar section to alert the user. Wind speed and direction etc in the weather section One of the most important features for fisherman like me is tide times and swell data, can this be integrated? Nobody has got this. You can be the first! You can have another section such as \"outdoor\" and this would have moon data including moon down and up, sunrise and sunset, tide times and heights, swell data (tide times and swell is very important for surfers and sailors as well). Compass can be moved here too. Then the fitness would have constant/on demand heart rate monitoring, stop watch, steps etc You can do it!!! Please!!! :)",

The moto 360 only brings up the app drawer when u swipe either the top or bottom so if u swipe the middle almost all the time it will seem like the watch is lagging. In this watchface only the top part works because the bottom keeps opening the event tab. Other than that I love this watch face. Especially the weather tab. Beautiful animations all around.....UPDATE, ok now I have a problem...a big one. I change the time from 24 to12 and it won't stay",

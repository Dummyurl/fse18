        "comment": "I want to test the battery drain of Watchmaker and this is very like one i made. That's the only reason I paid for this. It should be free. Far far better are. It would be better to have all hours marked, The date has no window. There should be a choice of turning the seconds off. It's a drain. There's no dynamic shadows, to give a feel of depth to the hands. This is so basic 5mins to code in LA and 30 tops to do the rest. I made it to see.",

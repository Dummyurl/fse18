Because if you are doing it right, you are zonked.  You don\u2019t have the time or energy to fiddle with an app.  No complicated drop-down boxes or repetitive entry.  Weights are properly auto-populated. The timer doesn't block the screen. (Jefit I\u2019m looking at you)  In Beefcake, it tracks were you were and were you are.  One or two single presses to enter data.  That\u2019s it.  Three options to track repetitions should satisfy straight liners and pyramid types.   Yes, there are things missing like cloud storage and Google fit integration. But I hear an Android Wear version is in beta, so development is ongoing.  And I haven\u2019t had a crash yet. The basics are there and they are solid. Some of the importing and graphs are paid.  But\u2019s like 1/3 of a Starbuck Verde per month.  Come on, throw the dudes a buck.",

I especially like the clean UI, and the ability to add custom exercises and make a workout on the fly, or to create a routine and save it.  The only thing this app is missing is the ability to enter in notes for each exercise.  It would be nice to be able to note if you failed on a rep, or if a weight felt heavier than usual.  If a notes section could be added, this app would be perfect.",

Some of them were quite close to what I wanted for my circuit training but it was only once I have looked, tested and tried Beefcake that I can finally say I have found what I need. I am fairly sure there is plenty of things that can be done with the app to make it even better but for anyone doing any kind of circuit training, there is no better app than this one.",

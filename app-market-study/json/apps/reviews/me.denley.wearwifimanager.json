That day I made quite a bit of photos but I had wifi off on my phone and photos were set to backup on wifi only. Tried to enable wifi in blind (touch still worked) but to no avail.  Then I thought there must be an app for my watch to control phone wifi remotely. I went to Play Store on my laptop and I found this app pretty fast. A click and 5m later it was installed on my phone & wear.                         The app saved my photos! I've enabled wifi from my watch, and photos started backing up immediately!   Few tens of my photos from an one time event would be otherwise lost, as the damaged phone is encrypted.",

First WiFi turned on but then wouldn't turn off and there's no direct way that it states to shut off wifi, tried turning on wifi and it doesn't work period.. Maybe better luck if they created location service on and off. Update: received an email from the developer explaining toggle is the on/off for wifi, which is more obvious. Still the toggle is leggy and shows no slash mark on the wifi connection to show disabled. The wifi turns off and immediately back on.",

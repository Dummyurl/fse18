        "comment": "Love the idea. The colour is now fixed but is still grey in dim mode? Is that by design, I'd like it to be the colour all the time, or an option to choose the dim mode colour because grey is v dull. Also,  the hour hand grows grey before changing colour which looks odd. Then I think it would be 5 stars. Thx. Re reply,  perhaps an option and grey by default would still fit spec? Is that possible?",

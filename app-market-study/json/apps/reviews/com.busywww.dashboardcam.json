Still, I cannot give if five stars, because sometimes I don't want to use the GPS. The GPS markings in my footages have no relevance to me, so I would appreciate if I would have the chance of working with this software without turning on the GPS receiver. Until then, I'll give it four stars, with all my heart.",

The GPS was not turned on when the app was starting, and the error message function caused the problems. I will check and update the app asap.

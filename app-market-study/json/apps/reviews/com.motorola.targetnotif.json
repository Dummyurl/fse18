This is just waste of money. even china made smart watches have the same concept which is available for way more less price than MOTO price. If this MOTO has to stand apart among chinese brand, they have to have different working system.. If you can locate only when Bluetooth is turned ON & app is running, what more different u did compared with Chinese makes? Even chinese made has the same concept & selling at less price.

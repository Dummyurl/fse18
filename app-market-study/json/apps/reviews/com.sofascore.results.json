On my previous Android sets i had the option to select notification sound for football matches which was classified into 3 types  \"match info\" had a different notification sound.. There was a different sound for \"scores\" and a different sound for \" half time\" or \"full time\". Now all sports have same notification sound and its difficult to understand what is happening which previously i could understand just by listening to the notification sound that whether it was lineups notification or notification of a goal scored. Please fix this problem because besides this the app is awesome and i only use this app to follow football scores. Please get a fix soon.Release an update for this problem and introduce these options as they are for other android versions because the notification sounds really help to understand whats going on even without opening the app.",

Could you do sth about it? I mean, there are dozen of sports which can be used to bet, but can you make at least one, the track&field, where true fans can just, like the name of the app says, keep score of events????? C'mon!!!! p.s. Oh, yeah, can you make that we decide what part of app opens at startup. For example I would like an option to always see the Favourites bar when I start the app?????",

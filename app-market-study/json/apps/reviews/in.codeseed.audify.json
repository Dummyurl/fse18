But I have one missing feature to mention: p.e. in whatsapp I receive messages in different languages (English, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch) , and all of them are spoken with the default language (English),and it is pretty annoying. This language resiliency feature is present in one app in the play store (@Voice Aloud Reader) which speaks in the language of the webpage or whatever other content in the appropriate language and it would be a great feature if your app has it too. Is it in your plans to implement that in the future?",

I recently had an issue with my Bluetooth hearing aids not turning on quickly enough to relay short notifications. Even though it wasn't an Audify problem, the developers took the time to analyse what was happening and provided a solution.  Outstanding support!",

Occationally it works. Really annoying. It seems to me that my settings keep getting reset to defaults. I regret paying for it.  Previously: \"It worked decently for a while. Had to uninstall it because it no longer works. Kills the sound for all apps on my BT headphones (Bose QC35). I tried to reinstall it but get the same issue. Shame 'cause I payed for unlimited.

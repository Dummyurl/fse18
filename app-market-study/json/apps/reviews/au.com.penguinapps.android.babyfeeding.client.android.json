Otherwise, App is easy to use and very user friendly. So much better than writing everything down. Just wish I would've known about this sooner. Unfortunately, the app stopped letting me and my wife sync and required upgrade to even look at timeline or summary. It was great for 2 weeks and then just kind of cut us off.",

Now that my youngest are 2 and 4 I use it most to track medication, temperature and sickness. This app is wonderful and I'm so happy I purchased it 4 years ago. It has been well worth the money I spent. Not to mention there have been updates added throughout the years that make this app even better. Very user friendly. I used/use this alot when taking my kids to the doctor as it literally has everything the Dr wants to know on it. Highly recommended from this mother of 5!!",

I have Android, wife has IOS and we both had to pay $5 each for the priveledge if auto sync and yet it's not 100%. Also even after paying for \"premium\" they force you to write a review to remove that request that is plastered on the screen.

Would suggest adding some options to be more detailed in the diaper logs, with the chances of it being a topic mentioned at least once between a parent and their pediatrician. Also another great convenience would ultimately be the option to add and customize your own tasks or journals while having the ability to edit and priorities with existing ones alike. I really like this app and I plan to stick with it. Unless of course, one comes along just like this one but with those features included ;) Thanks for the app as is, I must say. Makes my head hurt less than trying to keep track of everything by memory.",

I love the fact that you just have to hit a button and it logs all the details, very user friendly. The ability to change the time after starting a feeding is also helpful because very rarely am I able to hit the button right when I start. The graphs and reports are awesome and have helped us keep an eye on her growth and habits. Can't wait to keep using this as she gets older!",

Buttons could be in the middle of the screen to better reach and turning the phone accidentally should not make you start all over. 2.Selecting date and time should have option \"now\" or \"restart\" (i.e., I start a new sleep but baby wakes up and I need to restart it). Also for adding past events, please, make the end date by default be the same as start date (with possibility to change) - as I normally want to add a past event which is 10min or 30min, there are rarely 5 day events.",

So when I go to the doctor, I am able to tell her definitively instead of guesses and assumptions. Because who really remembers when you're getting up all hours of the night. Highly highly recommend.",

Now I have to pay if I want to continue using some features which I won't do so now the alarm only goes off if I touch my phone so if I'm sleeping I might miss a feeding & I can't see the daily summary anymore which is sad because that was really helpful. I'm a bit frustrated with this because like I said I was really enjoying this app and it was very helpful in keeping track of everything for my newborn but now I think I might have to uninstall it & find something else because the alarm is necessary & it's not working right.",

This app was especially important to restore because I had recorded my baby's milestones in the journal section.  Being a mother of two, it's also hard for me to remember things especially passphrases. Luckily the customer support is just as awesome and was able to help me retrieve my passphrase so I can have all my records again!",

I will eventually buy it because I do like the app, but I think you should be able to have multiple children on the app without having to purchase. There's ads all over the app. I run a daycare so keeping track of everyone can be difficult. All the kids are under 4. This keeps me on track with my own children, and if I want the daycare kids as well. The only thing I would change is the alert every two hours for feeding. My feedings are more spaced out. Maybe an option for how many hours? Other than that great app!",

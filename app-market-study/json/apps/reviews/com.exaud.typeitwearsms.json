If there was a way to select favourite contacts and have them stay at the top of the contact s list, I would award it 5 stars. The keyboard input is a bit limited as it's restricted to phone key layout only and there's no predictive text, but I probably won't use that anyway.",

If possible would be good to have a slightly smaller delete button, full screen fit when typing on a circular watch, ability to swipe away when typing a double L for example so that not waiting for timeout, and better fit on circular screens (top and bottom tiny bit cut off when reading sms). However best interface yet for typing so far well done keep it up",

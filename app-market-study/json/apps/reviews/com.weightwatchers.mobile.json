For instance I cannot scroll to the bottom of long threads without the page refreshing and taking me back to the top of the page. There are other little bugs also. Fix these things and i will change my review to 5 stars. It could easily be a 5 star app if you would make it more user friendly. There are lots of great things about the app. It just needs to be better.",

Connect is fun. Best thing for me. All my data going back in time is all still here. I now rate you 5 stars!   Update 12/9 this was my switch day. Nice surprise. It works. But ... All the foods I created myself need to be done again..Update 12/8: the mobile app is back for now. My switch over day is Thursday. I do like the exercise tracking. Much better. Sunday, 12/6: The mobile app is offline again. Since this is the big switchover day, about what I expected. I wish there had been more transparency and communication during this change over.",

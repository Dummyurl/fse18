It's very easy to accidentally tap an item and it's really hard to tell which item just vanished. Really missing the Dutch language as well as not all of my family members know English very well.  While I love the idea of adding photos to products, I'd really like to be able to see those pictures in the list without having to long press the item. I'd also love an easier way to add a different quantity straight from the list.",

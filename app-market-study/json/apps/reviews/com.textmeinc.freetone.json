Had to call the power company 6 times just to try and complete a single conversation due to drops. Gave up after the last one.  Update:  still dropping important calls mid call.  Very aggravating and not dependable.  No response from the developer is bad",

Not ringing, or any notification someone has text either. Now, even worse, it won't even open at all. I'm really unhappy, and I truly had such high hopes. Please fix, or lose a loyal customer of any years!!!",

This is an annoying tactic installed to bother you and your friends into purchasing a subscription hiding under the idea that its advertising to your friends, when in fact the lack of the  app telling people it was an app was the biggest draw, most people acted surprised and wanted the app as a cheap alternative line for texting, and calls.        The app working like it was a contract phone plan, but instead of monthly payment you pay with ads, Was an inspired idea. I fear the direction this app is going.",

This once was a great app but now has so many adds its has become almost unusable in my own opinion. I've had this app for over 5 years now and it has never been bad till now when I first got the app it was great but now needs fixed to get all the bugs out",

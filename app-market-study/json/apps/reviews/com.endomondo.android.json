Maybe new ui is useful for some sports that I am not practicing? Anyway I really don't like hybrid of map and workout information. If I need map, sliding to other screen was perfectly fine, but more often when I need orientation I switch to some other app with better maps(like OSM). I really miss average speed when I am running and stop button should be there(it is good idea to stop workout after holding button for couple seconds). Also I can still accidental pause workout, so it didn't solve much. Awesome UI/UX on the phone was something that used to distinguish endomondo from its  competitors, I hope you will get again on track. And maybe you should focus more on improving web interface?",

Since last update it does not show me my heart graph of bmp. This is very disapointing as it seems you have to pay to show you this. I have already bought this app years ago (before UA bouhgt it) and dont want to pay some monthy fees. Will have to look for something else.",

I changed my rating from a 1 star to a 5 star based on this alone.] I hate the new interface. It highly prioritizes people use use Spotify. I use Google Play music. If I wanted to add an identified song on Google Play Music, I'd need to back out and go to my song history on Shazam and then add the song to Google Play Music from there. Needless to say, I will be looking for a different music identification app now.",

Nice and quick but struggles with rarer house and techno records.  It's still a solid app and I like the auto-Shazam feature that'll automatically tag the songs from your evening.  :)    UPDATE Dec 2017 It's appallingly bad at identifying remixes.  There should be an option to tell the app it's tagged the wrong song and to try a longer snippet.  With all music now being digital with its own unique signature there's simply no excuse for Shazam to be this bad at remixes.  I'm still glad to have it but it's nearly useless at catching things I listen to a lot of the time.",

Once you are finished looking for your music, which all get deleted eventually, why hide the delete into a 2 click menu instead of a 1 click icon on the same page? The GUI is now flawed, please fix. This is unable to identify music which has been around for 50 yrs, eg Jimmy Rodgers - Today, SoundHound was able to essily identify it so you really need both apps. Update Feb 18. Now the delete is renamed and moved again, as if to make deleting your Shazams even more painful. Just bring back the delete icon ffs?!?!",

Their lyrics usually have some sort of mistakes in them, they are spaced so far apart that constant scrolling is required to keep up, and they have breaks in all the wrong places not in line with where a verse actually starts or finishes.  And the worst thing is, I have paid for the Encore version of Shazam so that there's no ads, but then I go to the lyrics, and musixmatch has ADS.  Dump them Shazam, they're terrible.",

        "comment": "Excellent app!  I tried countless other options and finally found this one which worked great.  I specifically have chosen photos that make me smile - that way I am smiling all day long :-)  Note that you manage the app through the Android Wear app, not it's on phone app.  I'm going to give this 5 stars because I'm thrilled, but I would suggest two options:  a) Add the day/date as an option on the clock.  b) Add folders in the photo selection box - all photos together is difficult to manage.  To make this easy, I use Google Photos only for my watch faces and select them all after cropping square.  Makes them easy to manage.  Again, VERY satisfied with this app.",

Just wish I could tell before I select a photo how it will appear on my LG Urbane as a couple of photos get the heads cut off on the watch.  Don't notice any battery hit either, so suspect it is caching the photos on the watch.",

I turn off my location all the time to save my battery and this app would not stop sending me notifications every few seconds even after I took away all its permissions and ability to draw over other apps and send notifications.  I have no idea what this app even did for my watch anyway, so good riddance.",

Please fix! Don't make me resort to the fruit variety.",

Cannot copy google account to watch, therefore play store on watch doesn't work. Eventhought google play music doesn't exit anymore on the watch.

Not to mention it takes a rediculously long yime to reset it. Then, once it's finally up and running, it takes an act of congress to find all your watch faces again and reinstal them because even though these are already on your phone, they are not recognized so you have to download them from the watch. This wasn't the case when I bought the watch but only after a forced update. Thanks Asus and gooe for making my life even more difficult.

Many apps are working, again -- except text messaging apps I was using (one from Google).  When I changed the font to get a watch face to display the time correctly, it made the on-screen keyboard too small (but now usable with effort).  If I didn't have another Android Wear watch (Sony SmartWatch 3.0) to wear in the mean time, this whole experience would have been extremely unworkable -- and I would have bought one.  Hope they go back to 1.0.  Probably, I would have to seriously think about ever buying a watch from them, again!  The initial experience was great with 1.0 -- but deploying 2.0 well before it was ready was crippling -- and I very much wonder about Asus's judgement.",

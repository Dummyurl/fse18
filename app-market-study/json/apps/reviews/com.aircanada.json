When watching a movie Rouge player randomly plays the same 3 minutes of commercials every 10 minutes which is fine since you can skip them. But then the movie resets every single time. I pad goes to sleep? Movie resets. Lock your I pad?  Movie resets. Plane announcement? Movie resets.",

This was not obvious to me so there is a problem there but it did work after I looked into it. The app does retrieve my information now. Way better.   Thanks for responding.  When a person signs in it should pull up their flights not ask you to submit tracking numbers - useless app - perhaps the writers should try using it.",

Basically spent half my flight trying to get a movie loaded and when I finally did when I tried to remind 30s it crashed and spent another 30 minutes getting started again. BUT it does NOT remember where you left off limenthe traditional back of seats screen. When I checked in it doesn't add the trip to my trips. You have to do it separately horrible",

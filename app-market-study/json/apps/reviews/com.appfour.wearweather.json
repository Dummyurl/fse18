Update 30th Jan  I see developer responded to my review feedback quickly but not to this question I raised by email.   I still have the same issue. I expect when I arrive in the next city, in this case Los Angeles, the wear weather app will continue to show the city I was in and not update itself to the location of my \" current location\"   I do not want to manually define a location or intervine, I simply want the app to show me the weather of my current location.   Can you confirm this is possible? In which case I am doing something wrong and need help, or this is a working as designed.",

The application UI is nice, clean and polished (both Android and Windows). Having extensions for Chrome and Firefox is a plus I don't use yet but certainly useful. And it's actively updated.",

This is even worse and more unreliable in the Windows app. I've reported his by email over 6 months ago but still no fix or improvement.  Edit - all these sites are major and have favicons. Eg. Amazon's icon doesn't appear in the windows app. Other password managers can do this ok",

It has all the features I need except one:  a WiFi only direct app-to-desktop sync without relying on a cloud service (which is what iAccounts offered). Data entry via the free desktop client is easy enough and the app is clean and a breeze to use. Would be good if the app can be installed on an SD card since my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 has only 16GB internal storage. SiC doesn't take up much room so not a big deal.

Best part is in this pro version you can download on all your devices and laptops and desktops and it sync with cloud so if a data is added it gets automatically updated on all your devices within a second.

        "comment": "I absolutely love this app. The design and functionality are exceptional. However, I really wish it had support for 2-factor codes so those could be stored in the cloud across multiple devices (there is an app for that in the store, but all in one would be better than having to have a second app). Overall, I highly recommend safeincloud. Strong passwords are important, and this makes it much easier to manage them. UPDATE: this app DOES support 2-factor codes. That should be stated more clearly in the features description as its a great feature! Thanks for an awesome app.",

        "comment": "Going back to Roboform.  SIC is a good, not great, password manager. 1-star for encrypting important and sensitive data in a straightforward manner. 1-star for a mostly uncluttered UI. And 1-star for letting me store my data.  It falls apart with the clunky browser integration, making quite a few log-ins on the same domain a frustrating task of copy/paste instead of a one-click.  Because SIC only recognizes a specific URL, it can't handle any other log-in from the same domain. Even a two-step login is painful, making you stab the extension icon to fill in the username, then in the next dialog, the password.  Eventually you get the dreaded \"Failed to detect login and password input fields on this page\" pop-up if you try to log into a username only field on the same site after a period of inactivity. And SIC in the taskbar is already unlocked!  Just as frustrating is the developer - on at least one occasion I reached out with a few suggestions to improve browser integration, and his response was so uninviting, I deleted the e-mail response right after reading it.  This thing can really cramp a workflow with its clunky and simplistic browser integration.",

The app as well will not allow you to exit a ride unless you give up your friends and family's names and phone numbers and all their information you have collected, as it will freeze up the app. I see no need to ever give my friends and family to a group of people I don't know for what ever marketing or perverted needs they have. This app is not worth it. Plus to get rid of the ads you have to pay a monthly fee and give up your friends and family info.  Give me a one time fee for the normally free service without ads and remove the contacts requirement.  Then if I ever find out you met my requirements I may come back to your ap. Till then not a chance.",

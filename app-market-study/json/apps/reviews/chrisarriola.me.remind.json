        "comment": "I was looking for some kind of mindfulness bell that would work with my Moto 360. This is perfect.  The author is very friendly and responsive, and quickly addressed the one issue I had with the app -- it had a dependency it didn't need. He responded right away to my concern saying it was there temporarily during debugging and wasn't meant to be in the final product, and it was quickly removed and the app was updated.  Now the app has zero dependencies and does its job well.",

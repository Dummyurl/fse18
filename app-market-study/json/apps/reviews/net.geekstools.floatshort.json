It had been so hard for me to switch app to app because my phone take tons of amount of time to launch each app. If I open one app and another one would take time to open when I reopen it. I am studying and only have one phone to do search with a browser, kindle, email, hand an type writing and constantly switching apps. This app switches apps like MIRACLE \ud83d\ude07This is saving me lots of time(and my stress level stay healthy as well)",

When i activate \"Auto Transparent\", come back to the list of apps, check some more apps to be floated... The icons appeared overlapped.  2. When i tried to move those, there were many icons of the same apps were created!  3. It wasn't possible to remove those! The app got freezed!  It will be extremly helpful, if user can create not only icons for Apps but also... floating shortcuts for ACTIVITIES!!! I hope u will have this in your development plan!",

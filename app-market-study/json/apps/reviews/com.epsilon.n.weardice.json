I'm assuming it's some kind of looping crash or looping logic that's causing the issue. Sorry to say had to reset my watch to factory twice because of this application. Oh and it doesn't like to remove itself. Stays resident when application removed from phone, and just shows a loading screen for thirty seconds or so then closes out",

I'm sorry you had to reset your watch twice, though I can't figure out what this issue stems from. Are you sure this app is the issue? If you're interested in fixing this issue let me know.",

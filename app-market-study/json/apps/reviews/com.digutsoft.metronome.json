However, there are a few problems with it. First, the haptic feedback is late enough that it's rather disorienting, at least on my Moto 360 (1st gen). I would personally prefer no feedback at all. And second, the button that you tap to set the tempo moves after you initially tap it. I think it would be better for it to stay in the same place.",

It does what it's supposed to (be a metronome) and it does it extremely well, I love that I don't have a loud noise going off every beat, but rather a gentle but very noticeable vibration on my wrist. The actual developers are great too! I left a review when I first downloaded this app with a couple features it still needed, and within 2 days I'd received a reply to my review and an update with all those features.  Then last night, right before going to sleep, I left a review with a huge bug, and by morning I had another reply and an update that fixed the bug.

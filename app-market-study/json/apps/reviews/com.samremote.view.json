The app scans For tv every time  you open it,  even if its running in the background and even if its in the notifications. With that every time there is a full page ad you gotta wait a bit to be able to close it. Also constant banner ad below remote which thats fine but scanning for tv eveytime you switch an app and  getting an ad pop up EVERYTIME For what its worth, its  NOT worth it.  The app works most of the time but not hundred percent. In the handful of times i used it, few times got the ad but no tv found, had to kill the app and restart app, then got the ad again and found tv. Smart hub/ home button doesn't seem to work either. Look for another app. When you need to use the app quickly like to mute the tv, it will take you about 20 seconds to the remote after scanning and ads. Redicoulous!",

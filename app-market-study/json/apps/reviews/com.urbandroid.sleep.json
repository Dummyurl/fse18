I've NEVER instigated sleep record but I got a notification this afternoon asking if I slept between (time X) and (time Y) and wanting me to create a sleep record!!?? Pressing Cancel did hide this but it did not get rid of it. And Devs, please don't respond with your generic BS Auto-response, it just proves how useless you are. PREVIOUS: This app is supposed to be able to sound the alarm even when the Do Not Disturb function is active on the phone. It does  not. In the app I have everything checked to enable it to override the Do Not Disturb function and on my phone, from the Settings menu I have allowed this app to override the Do Not Disturb function but still not a single sound.",

Worth the money, a Great investment for anyone with trouble sleeping. Alarm wakes you close to desired time. Reason being it does so when you're in the lightest stage of sleep instead of rem. This way you don't wake up feeling groggy. Alarm starts quietly and builds so you're not startled. You can use your own sounds for the alarm as well.",

I set it to the default 30 minutes but, I'm always woken up 30 mins. early every time! Never on time. Being up early is fine and dandy but, sometimes I wish it'd let me sleep a proper 8 hrs., not 7 1/2!",

My phone is new, their speakers are great, and hearing a metal cat purr is not relaxing.  Second, sonar seems to defeat the purpose of recording yourself sleep. If you playback your sleep, all you hear is clicking beeps. Not only that, but it kept raising the volume on my phone! *I* may not mind listening to monks chanting OM into the wee hours, but my spouse sure as hell isn't into it. Clearly I can just go back to the other setting, but I figured someone should be informed about that fun volume issue.",

Then in the most recent update they destroyed the interface, sleep tracking now stops before you wake up, and I've just been woken up by an alarm I had turned off after just 5 hours sleep on a Sunday morning. Hard to see how I can continue using anything as buggy as this, and alpha testing on your paid users leaves a very unpleasant taste in the mouth. Even if they fix these bugs, how can I trust them not to do this again? UPDATE: The developer has tried to dismiss these issues by saying it's a problem with my phone, and that other people all love the new interface. There was no \"problem with my phone\" until the app was updated, and I've already seen comments from other users saying they don't like it! I've already figured out what happened and exactly why it happened, and it wasn't my phone. Insulting the intelligence of your users isn't a good look. Fix your poorly tested update!!",

This is probably a bug, or you pull data from another source (as I saw this on the wikia page for fighter as well), but battle Master and eldritch knight are missing from the fighter. I would also like to see hyperlinks to other sections. So, for example, I see a reference to another section of the phb and I can navigate there quickly. Ie, I see the word spells it takes me to the spells section. I am interested in the character manager, but would like to try before I buy. A short timed demo would be nice within the app. Otherwise, it looks pretty good!",

        "comment": "Great app. But as others say, the character sheet is where this app falls short. I too think it's overly complicated for what's needed. Yes I understand the need for leaving things open for customization, but there's gotta be a better approach than making it appear more confusing. My biggest complaint though is the spell casting. I mean, wth is up with that screen? When i have 3 1st lvl spell slots, i should not be able to cast 3 burning hands AND 3 magic missles before i get stopped for using up my 3 slots. Cuz i really used up 6 slots. It should be collective, not separate. That is enough to push me to a different app for spells.",

This feature to keep the spells you cast is very recent and we are still working out how to make this work for both wizards and sorceress type of spells. It now uses a wizard approach, where you prepare spells each day. This does of course not really work when you play a sorcerer.",

Also make sure GPS Mode is in \"High accuracy\" in Settings. What Wear watch do you have? Please send me an email so I can correct the error for others if there is a problem. Thanks!",

Matched my vehicles speedometer within 2-3%,  Cool app that really only has utility when you can't get speed from an embedded readout (speedometer).  Will be useful when skateboarding, running, boating, etc.    Thanks Dev!",

Id like to use the app for sailing, but I need it to display 1/10ths of a knot (or even 1/100ths). Also if you added an option to display the latest GPS heading on my watch that would be perfect!",

I've drank so so much water since I started this app. Some days are hard cause with my height and weight they recommend 97oz a day but I'm getting much closer every day.

Additionally, it would be nice to have the ability to automatically set water mounts for certain days of the week when activities occur like workouts, cleanses, massage, or with certain meds when increased water is important. Possibly a manual option to increase by percentage in the daily diary. B+ bc the ads are over the top.",

I would like to see custom water sizes to reflect non-metric measurements. I usually drink pints of water (560ml), which I cannot apply to glasses within the app, instead I must use bottles 1/2 full. It's a little issue but with all the customisation options, it seems odd to not have pints.   OLD REVIEW: Paid to remove ads. Ads were removed. Opened the app again later and the ads are back. I select remove ads and I'm asked to pay 99p again.",

        "comment": "It is a fully functioning app, no complaints just one (the reason why I uninstalled and used a different app), it doesnt show how much water you have consumed. For me knowing so helps me input how many ml I drank from my bottle in case I forget (i use a 750 ml bottle -no glasses). Also it motivates. So I was disappointed when I didnt see the amount of ml consumed",

It doesnt do it automatically which is weird.  I have to go into fitbit app and open the water section for the day, then it is pulled over. Maybe its fitbits issue.  Suggest in the future linking into myfitnesspal since its very popular app.",

You can only set the reminders for time frames with no overlap with days of the week (basically, if you have a time set for Mon, you can't have a different time frame that includes Mon)... I need multiple different time frames, some for weekdays, some for weeknights and some for weekend days and some for weekend nights, and some for off days... My schedule is crazy and this app doesn't accommodate for my schedule very well. (I hope this makes sense.) for instance, my alarm clock app offers multiple different time frames to set different alarms. This would be a nice addition.",

I don't like that. 1 nitpicky things is the containers go from 8 to 20 to 40 oz. I sure you can adjust the 40 down but with most containers being 20 or 25, the pics look half empty. I would like a 30 Oz container to choose.",

The only complaint I have is that the weekly schedule widget doesn't update until late in the day so it'll say yesterday's date. Removed a star because now the widget doesn't work at all, it just says loading. Will give more stars when fixed",

And instead of having 3 choices when placing something new, maybe a default could be for normal activities, and a special button for tasks. This way could increase speed for putting new entry. Besides this, it s the 4th app I ve tested this week and I m going to stick to it because it s as simple, clean and practical as I d like it to be. Thanks!",

Also would like to see option to integrate use Google calendar colors. Add these and you will have 5 star app.",

UPDATE So I've been using this calendar now for a while and at first it was exceptional. However over the past 2 weeks I get warning messages (I have a Samsung S6 Edge) that Wave is slowing my device down whilst accessing network. This warning is occurring 2 or 3 times a day. Maybe a bug update is needed?",

I currently use it and would like that service. 2nd: The NFL (American Football) schedule add-on for three teams I picked did not work.  The feature to utilize this app with the wearable devices is great, which is a strong selling point for me!  I will uninstall for now and hope that at least one of these issues is fixed in the future. I will reinstall then.",

It worked seamlessly when I first got it, but then the widget stopped showing any events. It would say \"Loading...\" and never update, even if I deleted and re-added the app, or deleted and reinstalled Wave. I even did a factory reset on my phone recently (for other reasons) and THAT finally fixed it... and now my tasks don't show in the widget anymore. (Galaxy S5)",

The only down tick is not due to WAVE, and is a result of the creation and use of the Material Theme/Design -- lack of screen space efficiency & too much white space.   Would love to see two additions: a. a dark theme, and b. a compressed theme - to eliminate all the white white space,changing from triple spacing to 1 or 1.5 spacing.",

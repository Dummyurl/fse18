The text to speech is amazing, you can hear who the message/email is from by hearing the name of the application along with a notification sound, who it is from and it reads the whole thing out loud so you don't have even take your phone out of your pocket/bag. It has so many more features than I have mentioned, this the best android wear applications available on the Play Store in my opinion...... excellent!!!",

The app did initally helped with vibration but I could not get it to provide audible notification for messages. I sent 2 emails to app support informing them of the problem and requesting assistance to remedy it. They never returned my calls.   I uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it. This time I got the audible and vibrations to work for messages received and reminders that I set. I have given the app 4 stars because of support's failure to respond to my two emails. It took a lot of work to get this to work for me to provide both Audible and vibratory notification for selected apps.  I have contributed $ to support this app.  ADDENDUM: I got the app to work by uninstalling and reinstalling it on BOTH my phone and watch. Works perfectly now no thanks to watch support. They never did respond to my emails.",

        "comment": "UPDATE 4: Found that clearing the watch app's data suddenly made the phone app work (sounds, vibrations were sent to the watch)... but only for around 15 minutes. Then watch fell silent again. NB: uninstalling/reinstalling either apps didn't work. Clearing both the watch & phone's data though (and then reprogramming all my settings again) made things work again. Going OK for 12 hours so far. UPDATE 3: Custom vibrations, sounds & TTS no longer working on the watch. UPDATE 2: Suddenly sounds are enabled now. Boy, this is some effort to get working. PREVIOUS UPDATE: the apps title is misleading. It is NOT CLEAR that TTS is not available in the free version (TTS suddenly sprang to life after I'd paid for premium). Description & English needs some work - if I'm mistaken then it's  another big/anomaly ... this app has quite a few of them. Finally got TTS to work, but sounds do not play (app says my watch does not support sounds ... yeah, it REALLY does) - Huawei 2. ORIGINAL: Whilst my Watch IS able to speak (eg via TTS/TalkBack tests) this app fails to speak when a notification arrives. The vibration patterns work ok, but there is no TTS NOTIFICATION and no media/sound notifications. In the phone app the Sounds Manager fails to play any sounds. Is this a related problem? App has permission to read notifications, the Watch companion app is installed and several \"Installed Apps\" have their pattern/sound set... but the Watch fails to read any TTS notifications. Shame... I was about to pay money :(",

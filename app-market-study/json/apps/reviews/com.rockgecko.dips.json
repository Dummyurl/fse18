I've taken hundreds of records by this point, and it's brilliant if you are aware of the limitations of your device. Just watch out if you have a flip case with a magnetic fastener in it, and calibrate often. The only downside (not the apps fault!) is that you're more likely to put your nice phone near rocky outcrops, I trashed my old phone by dropping it face-down on a nice sandstone outcrop. Totally worth it though.  Also, this app makes stereonets fun.",

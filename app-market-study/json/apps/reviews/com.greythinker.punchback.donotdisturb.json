And explained that the person they were trying to reach was no longer at this number - the calls continued.   After six months of clearing these calls every day i am deeply grateful for this solution.  Since i can't give you 6 stars, here are 5.",

After downloading the app I saw awesome features but when I officically used the app and set the app the to not allow a certain number to call and leave  a voicemail, it would block the call but the caller could still leave a voicemail. Is there something I'm doing wrong when setting it up?",

Finally, my voicemail notification bell isn't going off 3 to 4 times a day as a result of spammer messages.   The app also extracts blocked numbers from your phone's call log, so you can't even see if they called, unless you check the app's blocked call log. What a relief! A huge thank you to whomever built this app!",

So I can't compare it to other apps because they're not allowed by Android/Google Play store to hangup on calls. Not sure why, other than monopoly = $$. The pop-ups can be confusing or take up too much screen, so I just disabled them. Glad to have that option. So far, so good tho.",

I block it but 9 times a day I get a voicemail from them, I have requested several times to get them to quit but they dont. Even though I block it the get through to the voicemail and the call log doesn't show the number, and yes it's the right one. Why does it block all the rest with the exception of just one?",

Would love to see this app somehow connect with the MYCHART app by EPIC. All hospitals are trying to give patients access to as much information as possible from their medical charts through the EPIC system. This would be an awesome update.",

Once they include more pharmacies and hospitals everywhere, I will upgrade to 5 stars. Update, have been using it for about 3 weeks now and when I visited 2 Doctors so far and it's been very helpful documenting the meds, times meds were taken and doses. It's very convenient and easily accessible. I like the diary feature, it's where I note sudden changes in my vitals. The color codes should be customizable for ones own needs. This app is very close to earning 5 stars.",

Was a bit frustrated when you press take and you need to make a selection, because I tend to forget to record it straight away but the \"shake to take\" makes it a non-issue. Would love if you could set up pets as other members and for medication courses which are not daily, like dog worming or for some people injections. Have recommended this app to others who need help remembering meds.",

But this app is getting ever more pushy and not honoring my settings about popups and notifications. Inside the app I said \"No popup\". It pops up anyway. So I went to Android settings and blocked first popups, then notifications altogether. Guess what? It still pops up! From the pop-up I went directly to settings and saw that \"No popup\" was still selected. At this point I've had enough. If an app won't allow me to control my phone environment, it will not be on my phone.  Goodbye, and good riddance.",

However I have asked for/suggested repeatedly either a 10 HR interval or preferably a fever medication cycle setting you track alternating medications that shouldn't overlap but must be taken on not only schedule that alternates not only medication but alternates the length of time between medications.   ORIGINAL: The only reason for not getting 5 stars is the fact that where you can set the dose it's only single numbers. For liquid you should be able to put the ML or the tsp or tbsp instead of 1.00 etc. They need more avatars or the ability to upload your own or sync with Facebook or G+.  I hope they add the ability to list pills you have taken and allergies to medications. Also they need to add Wal-Mart to their online med refill.",

Before the app I had a special bag that I carried all of them in.  Obviously my brain was functioning at maximum capacity.  This app helped me organize, track and remember all my meds.  I also LOVE that the universe reminds me.  I also LOVE how I can track supplements and other types of meds.  I have my 11 year old twins on my account.  And had my 19 year cat.",

        "comment": "UPDATE: I gave this app 4.5 stars at first, and then 5 stars. I must now change it to 3 stars. Despite Medisafe's many very useful features (plus some cute ones, like customizable alert tones) and its reliability, it is only a so-so app because it is missing one *crucial* feature which I have been asking for since the app was launched.   After all this time, it is STILL impossible to quickly log ALL meds as being taken at one specific time, if they were not taken *on time*. Example: I take Medication A, Medication B,  Medication C and Medication D at 8:00 AM. I take them all together at one time. I *always* take them all together at one time. If you take them at the right time on the dot, you can quickly select \"Take all\" and you're done.   However, I am never exactly \"on time\". It's usually a few minutes to an hour before or after the scheduled time. But my doctor requires me to log the exact time I take these meds so he can better monitor whether I need adjustments to the dosages.   That means that when I take all four  medications at 8:19 AM, I have to use the drop down menu and clock wheel to enter 8:19 AM for each and every one of those four medications, even though I always take them all together!! It's hard enough to take my meds on time in the busy mornings with two small children; how do I also find time to sit there and enter each medication's time manually? Well... I don't. I had a major medical issue because I had so many \"missed\" medications that we didn't know whether I was taking enough or not and I ended up over medicated.   So now I have to use pen and paper to log my meds because it's ten times faster to write \"Meds A, B, C and D taken at 8:03 AM\" than it is to sit there and open every single medication's menu, long press \"choose exact time\" and then scroll to or type in each number for the time and then press OK.  One simple feature request ignored for two years renders this app little more than a database for what meds/dosages I'm taking. Which I now just write in the same notebook I use to log when I take them. And I just use an alarm on my phone to remind me. It's literally easier than using Medisafe, which is just too bad.",

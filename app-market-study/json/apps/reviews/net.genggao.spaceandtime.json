Ambient mode must match actual time (planet needs to be in the correct position), and position needs to be updated every minute!  2.  Option to have full-colour ambient mode, this is a beautiful watch face and needs to be enjoyed in full colour!  3.  Option to choose time before it goes into ambient mode (up to 60 seconds).  4.  Option to select ambient mode full colour brightness level.  Hours/minutes:  1. Hours: How about a star that moves round the clock edge to show the hours?  2. Minutes: how about adding rings to the planet so that the rings act more like a pointer to the minutes?  3. Option to chose minute indicator will be great too.  Animations:  1. Add more: asteroids, comets, satellites, UFOs, etc, moving in different directions.  2. Option to choose which animations to show.  Charge for this, or make the above premium features! I and I am sure many others will pay for it!!  Please reply to let me know that you have received this.  Many thanks, D Ghoshal",

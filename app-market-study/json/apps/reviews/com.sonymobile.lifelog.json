Being able to manually add sleep eg perhaps if taking a short refresh nap would be a great help. The same goes for other events such as when hit phone is not moving or being used, you might be watching TV or on a game consol. Please keep up the good work",

        "comment": "Lifelong has a lot of potential. It's a shame it's not got the motion accuracy of others like Shealth and Google fit. The weight tracker could be improved by adding St and lbs rather than just lbs or kg. The sleep detection just detects the time the phone is unused. An eating plan or something where you can record your intake would be a good addition. Overall the app is worth having but the developers could make it so much more.",

        "comment": "I agree with Anni Koch, the app has great potential. I have seen some unusual occurrences though. For one, I can walk over 4000 steps but the animation shows that I only walked for a few minutes. So what happened there Sony? If I don't fall asleep until after midnight, that nights sleep doesn't show up on the report....it's like it never happened. Maybe I dreamed it!  I do like the animations and the reports though. That and the ability to add the different apps on the dashboard.  Basically, the app will show the steps you take during the day and isn't bad at others but they could be improved.",

For example, according to what it tells you, you can take 30 steps while just sitting at your desk. As for smart alarm, it doesn't care what time period you've set. If you set the period to wake you up from 6:30 to 7:00, but closest REM sleep starts only at 7:50, the alarm will ring at 7:50. I recommend to set no time periods at all in order to be certain that you will be on time at work, school, etc.",

Please sort it out as this app used to be brilliant but for the lady few weeks it's been a total disappointment",

However what could be better is the accuracy of the step counter and the recognition of different activities.  It tends to think going up and down stairs is cycling etc.  It could also definitely do with an altimeter device to say how many stairs up you've climbed.  I agree with someone else that had said you should be able to add your own activities.  Loads of potential.",

On the adverts it shows how it detects if you are staying still and how many floors you've climbed. Yet there is no feature like that on this app. A bit disappointing as any other fitness tracker (e.g fitbit and the apple watch) can track the amount of floors climbed and they will notify you when you need to move. Even if the stair tracking is slightly inaccurate it should be a feature just like on the adverts. Please review these functions.",

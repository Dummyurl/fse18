I also like that switching to pro version without ads is simply a matter of getting a code from developers.  One thing i would suggest is that this pro version code can be linked to user email so that it can be used on multiple devices instead of requiring a new code for each device. Also it is not very clear at first how to update to pro version, so i would suggest including a bettet explanation in the help section.",

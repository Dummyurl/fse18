Be a little forgiving and educate your tech department that just because someone swipes a day down, doesnt mean you have to wait 4 hours to try again. You suck! If you don't want reviews like this, then use the God given intellect you're given to allow mistakes by the less intelligent. Not speaking for myself DF's.",

I like the feedback (vibration) on a win, and it's great that there is an option to toggle this, for those that may not want feedback (vibration) and/or wish to use less power. Finally, it'd be great to see additional slot machines (instead of just fruit), either within this game or as separate games...",

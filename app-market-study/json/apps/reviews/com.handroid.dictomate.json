I LOVE HOW DICTOMATE FOUND A WAY AROUND the Android 4.4 OBSTACLE - GOOGLE CREATED - preventing apps from recording on the extra SD CARD!! I LOVE BEING ABLE TO RECORD PHONE CALLS!!  AND NOW I AM CHANGING MY RATING TO A 5 because the developers just released multi-line descriptors for the NAME of each recording AND for each bookmark!!! WONDERFUL!!  This developer is the most responsive Android developer, I have ever worked with.  THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING APP and for RESPONDING SO QUICKLY to questions and new feature requests!!!",

        "comment": "Overall the app is very good for recording. Excellent recording features. But some of the things completely drive me nuts.  1. No option to change the flippin file naming convention. No matter how good a mobile app is, you will alwaus have to apply some noise suppression and some editing after recording, its a nightmare to find the most recent file by file name. 2. There is an option to save files to SD Card but it does not work. Each time I try, I get an error that SD card is not accessible. Well it is accessible to all the freakin apps in my phone. So every now and then I have to copy the data from internal memory to external. 3. The rename and delete function does not work. 4. Why do you have tiny buttons when you have a large empty space in the recording screen. Why can't you use it for something useful. Show some stats, warn for bad recording, noise, do something for the sake of doing.",

Recording quality is sound, interface very simple, like the rotate 180\u00b0 to make a bookmark automatically, only thing I wish it had lock screen and notification bar integration. Love the updates! Last one gave me the option to upload my recordings on Google Cloud now so I can listen to them from my PC.",

Dictomate should appear in the notification bar when a recording is in progress for easy access back to the app. Also you might be interested in the desktop widget for being able to start\\stop bookmark recording straight from  the desktop. Thanks!",

After trying them, none of the other bookmark tracks would play. 2) Stopped recording after no activity at the 15:20 mark. 3) Widget has no way to pause recording - seriously! 4) When you play a bookmark, pause it, then click play again, playback starts over at beginning of bookmark instead of where you paused it. 5) Timer display scrolls off screen when you have &gt; 10 bookmarks.

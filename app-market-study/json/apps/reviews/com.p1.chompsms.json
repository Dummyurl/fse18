If you don't like the ads buy the pro version. It's the last texting app you'll ever buy.   Chomp gives you a clean functioning interface. \ud83d\udc4d  It's dark mode is awesome!  If I had to nic-pic to find something I don't like,  it would be it's full immersive mode behavior. It's not as seamless as other apps.",

As I really am only using it as SMS app I haven't searched if it has any other features like video calling/group video calling, group messaging (saw MMS but haven't used it yet),  or other features some other messenger apps have. So if you want a easy to use messenger app that focus on texting and allows you to custumize with easy with all the gimmicks this the app for you. Even the ads unlike some apps don't get in the way.",

The developers are super nice, helpful, and give you what you ask for! I'll never use another text app. I've been using Chomp since my first smart phone, and it just keeps getting better without getting rid of the options I loved the most. I don't get worried when I see an update. These people care about your experience using Chomp, not treating you like a dollar sign, so they get major respect from me! #ChompForLife",

I had another app that came with my phone. There were no colors, it was giving me problems every time I would try to send a message, with no response. Well when I found this app, I found a true blessing!! All of what I had been working hard to get was right in this app. The colors are so unique and vibrate. All of my messages are getting where they are suppose to get to. This app is fast and the best thing I like about it is, it actually does things for you before you do. I don't know how it even knows how to do that,but it does. It's remarkable and genius!! When I go to write, my spelling is really not all that good at times, so I depend on the box above my typing to get me through my words because without it, I would be lost. This app to me is a life saver. It gets hats off I tell ya. It's a really good app and so anyone that is looking for a classy and a class A \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 app should get this one, as far as I'm concerned it's the best app I've ever seen or used. Thanks again for making my life much easier and fun!   (+_+)",

Of the other text messaging apps that are easy to use this is the only one that shows the character count so you can see when a message is about to be broken up into multiple messages in for older phones.  Since I have started limiting my messages to the maximum number of characters older phones can handle I've had no problems getting my message through. If I depend on the carrier to automatically break up my long message for older phones it gets mucked up half the time. Thanks to the developer for keeping the character count feature in there. I find it really annoying that other text apps have removed that feature in the name of \"simplicity\".",

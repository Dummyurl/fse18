(Despite it not being on iOS, sadly. But nothing on iOS compares to it.) UPDATE(02/2016):Still fantastic but hasn't been updated in a very long time. No longer syncs properly. Lost a bunch of recipes. No developer response. Wouldn't install anymore, sadly.",

        "comment": "The beautiful Material Design aesthetic is a wondrous delight! The functionality of adding recipes via the Android Chrome browser is simple, intuitive, and flawless. There could be an easier way to delete recipes without having to open the recipe and then remove it, but that is only a minor inconvenience. The only drawback is that you must use an Android Chrome browser to add recipes as there is no extension in the Chrome webstore for use on a computer. A chrome extension would greatly increase the appeal of this app and a broader audience would be able to share/save their recipes to the app. A Chrome app would also be a large boost as the recipes could then be accessed online from any chrome browser!",

I'm just nit picking though.  overall, i really enjoy the app.  the quick importing works for nearly all the recipe sites I use which is nice....the syncing is spot on, the overall UI is fantastic.  I would love to see multiple categories for one recipe though.  (EG: so I could have Zuccini pizza in both \"healthy\" and \"pizza\" categories).  throw it in the unlocked features, and you have a buyer.  even with the slight negatives in the app, I'm still giving 5 starts because its so well done and supported.",

The most important to me, since I forked over money for the Pro version, is that there is zero response or help from the developer. Usually that's enough for me to ditch even a free app, but I find that unacceptable with a paid app. Android Wear \"support\" does not function, which is rather upsetting because that's the primary reason I purchased the Pro version. Additionally, Web clipping has yet to work for me. The free version might still be worth your time, at least to check it out, but I would strongly advise against purchasing the Pro version.",

Leave my fractions alone. Import feature does not work half or less of the time. Has not been updated in over a year. Developer must have abandoned this app, it's a shame it is a decent app.",

This app is less of a way to browse a website's contents and more of a way to save your own recipes from wherever you'd like (which is what I'm looking for). It does this well, but the UI still needs work. Some of the fonts are thin and hard to read, the constantly changing recipe order is annoying, and the instructions section is too dense and uniform to be able to easily read it. The web clipper also isn't very good.",

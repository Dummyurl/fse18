        "comment": "Can't change the default settings on the watch face. Settings lock up whenever I try to open them. Emailed the creator about it and have not gotten a response. Looks cool but settings is a big deal.  *Edit Settings do work through Android Wear app as creator suggested. I was having issues with wear app as well but after an update it's working much better and I'm able to change settings. Thanks.",

I have been using this face for almost a week now and am very satisfied with it, its features are useful and the design is sleek. It's especially cool to me because I do hobby electronics and it remindes me of that one board for the raspberry pi.",

        "comment": "The app description fails to mention that the actual customization options are located in the main Android Wear app. There is NO separate app icon for this watchface on the phone. Needs better documentation on this description page. My two main issues with the design are: 1) It doesn't take the 'flat tire' design of the Moto 360 into account. You lose track of the minute indicator for a full 5 minutes off-screen. 2) While one of the dials can read the current temperature, it is only available in Celsius. We use Fahrenheit here in the US, but this is not an available option. Address these issues (add moto 360 mod that modifies the minute indicator and add Fahrenheit temp to weather), along with better documentation on this page, and it could be a great watchface!",

Connects then back to connect to device screen with no error message.  Lots of people reporting this so if yours works then good for you. Only needed when I typing on certain apps. I have an idea this will never be fixed.  I love my Nexus Player, guess it will be relegated to an older TV when I get Nvidia shield TV.",

If I leave the phone locked, I have to either restart this app or turn the Bluetooth on and off. The keyboard typing also lags between the phone and the Shield. It would be easier to set up a connection if we could manually input the IP address of the device we want to connect with this app.",

It occasionally does and works but not most of the times.   The problem is not just on the Samsung j5 that used to work really well. Same with Huawei Honor Pro 8.   The app tries connecting to the Mi Box and it goes on forever.  Any help is much appreciated.",

All of us have different phones and this is a paying to connect to the TV. Second biggest issue it has, it is to simplistic. It does not give you all the buttons you need to adequately control the TV. At a minimum there should have been the Discover button, input button, volume buttons and a settings button to get to the TV's settings. This app has a long way to go before becoming useful.

How about testing everything out asking the question before leaving a negative review because you can't figure out how to use it. Use the WiFi function instead of bluetooth if you have issues with Bluetooth. I have been using this on my shield for several months without a single issue.  I understand the mouse function would be great but that is the only negative thing. Overall this remote is awesome!",

Needs a minor refresh, perhaps a smooth widget with a volume slider. Or some slick icon shortcuts to things like mute and pause. A universal jump back 10 seconds and skip forward with functionality for all apps would be super handy. Also could really use a dedicated mute button on the interface.  Update the nav button icons with the times. No more silly house. This is your own app Google, give a damn.",

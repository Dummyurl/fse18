Hit the button on the watch and it will bring up the menu run  wear launcher or android wear. Select laucher you will the laucher. I like that you can have apps on the home screen, and uninstalling apps from the watch is a plus. 3 apps shortcuts will show up on face but you can add more and scroll on icons",

I set my watch face and the only way I can get this launcher back is to press the button on my watch, then my watch face is gone and I have to set it again. Maybe I'm stupid, or maybe it's just the way it is, who knows, nothing in the app to explain it.",

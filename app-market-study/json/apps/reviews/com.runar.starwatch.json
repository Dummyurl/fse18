Instead of seconds I would like to see the rim have daylight / twilight / dark displayed, and the sun and moon's positions marked using either true solar time or local mean time. That would make it a practical astronomy tool to boot.",

Given that few watch faces actually do anything apart from changing aesthetics, this one is pretty useful. You basically get a real time map of the sky on your wrist. You can get an idea of how long you have until sunset, whether the bright dot in the sky is a star or a planet, that sort of thing. I am running out of space,  so I'll leave it at that.",

        "comment": "Wish there was a way to have stars but less stars. I feel they clutter up the screen and take away from the planets. Some stars are bigger than others and look like planets. When you have everything on, the screen is super cluttered (Zenwatch2). Also, a little confused on what all I'm looking at as far as the way the planets rotate.. Think there could be some improvements. But its a pretty good face. Sucks there isn't a good square face verision",

        "comment": "Looks awesome, there only are a few things that could be improved on imo. In digital mode, I kinda wish there was an option to have the seconds show as numbers instead of this obnoxious circle-thingy - in analog mode, a real seconds hand would be nice.  Little dots/circles around the edges (only in analog, to indicate where the hour numbers on a normal watch would be - and maybe some minute marks in between too. Then I could tell the time more precisely.) would look way better imo, especially if we had the option to choose between different styles of watch hands.  In addition, it would really be nice to be able to somehow hide the time/date so all you see is the star chart... then it would actually be usable too!  Oh, and one last thing: Having the ability to change the font to something more stylish/elegant/less casual would be great.",

        "comment": "I like it so far and I will almost certainly update this review later.  I love the screen (I used to be a physicist and always secretly wanted to be an astronomer - but was always in the right place at the right time - for SOMETHING ELSE of course - and so I never got to do what I really wanted), and it looks wonderful on my Moto 360.  The single problem which I've encountered so far was in buying it and then getting to use it.  That's why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.  I often buy things for my phone from my desktop machine and have never had this problem before, but when I bought this app from my desktop, it showed that it was installed.  But \"installed where???\" was the question.  It didn't show up on my phone (even after a full reboot and after sync'ing), and even going into settings and looking there the app manager list didn't locate it.    So I got a refund and then bought it from my phone directly - and Bingo, it worked.  Otherwise so far I really like it, and unless it turns out to be a battery hog (on a moto 360 that can be an issue), I'll most likely use it as my primary face.",

This face is wonderful, and totally unique that sets smart watches apart from regular watches. For that I am grateful, with quick support time, and truly a watch face worth paying for.",

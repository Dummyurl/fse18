        "comment": "Ok i have had over 5 conversations with both Nixon Europe and Nixon UK they simply do not appreciate that the IOS app is buggy and also when installed on the Mission Watch the information does not update its very sporadic to ask Us to drop over \u00a3340 or $400 depending wherever You purchased the watch from,that this level of ignoring Your customers is not on i urge other Nixon Mission owners suffering the same levels of frustration to force Nixon to do something about this work in progress app.Very,very disappointing. UPDATE!!!!!!!!The App on the iPhone 6S simply doesn't work on the Surf spots but as before the Snow spots all load fine just doesn't make any sense has anyone managed to resolve this issue?",

I had to return my watch for a few weeks for service and when I got it back, it's working way better than it has in the past. The recent updates to all of your faces make them more usable, and the usability of the app itself and how that info displays on the watch is more stable. Only thing I can request is that there is additional information displayed on watch faces when they are in ambient mode. Other than that, keep up the good work!",

Now, the app is useless for anything other than surf/snow info. Can't even configure any of the basics.   Also, most round watchfaces do not work with the watch. And I have to install the FROM the watch. I can't look for them on play store on my phone like on my moto 360 G2  So far not impressed with the SW side.",

The Mission app and watch face don't push for data in the background and so surf info displayed on the watch is  only up to date if you've recently opened the phone app (which I rarely do). Also, it relies on surfline forecasts which are typically wildly inaccurate for swell size for UK spots. Would be greatly improved if it could drawn on Magicseaweed or Windguru surf forecasts. Tide heights are also all over the shop. It often suggests that the local tidal range is as small as a few feet, when in practice it's several metres. 13/12/17 update - still experiencing all of the same draw back with not solution in sight.",

        "comment": "I'm giving the app two stars because of the following:  - Tide times are very inaccurate; I thought the vertical line on top of the wave profile should flag the momentarily level and time, but it does not (neither on the phone nor on the watch) - I do not get any wave quality like \"epic\", \"good\", etc. (as seen on ads)  All of the above applies to both android (tested on a Samsung J7) and iOS (10.3.2 on iPad Air 2)  Also, it is still not clear to me whether the \"real-time\" surf condition report actually means my watch provides me the current (as in now) info on surf conditions DETACHED from my phone. If that is not the case, then carrying around my (not precisely small) watch in addition to my phone, where I can check the surf conditions anyway, seems like an overkill.  I'm sure you guys can do WAY better.",

I keep sending Feedback/comments to no avail.  Open App, it crashes.  Re-install...try again....crashes.  In sum, I can't use the Snow weather updates for my resorts which is really defeating its purpose for me this winter.",

        "comment": "Hey Nixon... Let me stay by saying you guys have been good to me for close to a decade. I've had to replace and upgrade my tide watches as they've been recalled, malfunctioned or simply failed. With some cost to me and some to you. Finally the Mission. But this watch seems like no more than a glorified remote control with a few added apps like a calculator. Without being a true GPS watch all I can do is wear my watch and press start to initiate the phone. Usually the battery dies before I'm done so....... My time on the mountain is ended by taking out my phone to switch off Strava. And that's ok because the watch is too fiddly and small to use with a glove anyway.  Other than that, wearing it surfing, the water droplets cause it the react strangely on the touchscreen. And don't dare try it surfing with a long sleeve wetsuit. All I feel is the watch buzz buzz as it reacts to the wetsuit arm touching the screen failing to try unlock it. And since it isn't really a GPS, I can't Strava my surf anyway because my phone isn't waterproof or where would I put it and I'm not paying for another gadget.   Most of the time I keep it on airplane mode now to keep some battery life. Going for a run this watch also is seems redundant as I would love to not carry my phone in my hand as I have the watch but that's not how it works.  I get it you're keeping with the times. But this watch is below you. Looks kinda good but rather than smart its mostly annoying and stupid.",

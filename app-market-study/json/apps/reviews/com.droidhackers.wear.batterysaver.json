While the battery life for my Moto 360 was fantastic, and it did do it's wake-up every 10 minutes to pick up notifications, it would never connect bluetooth on demand.  This means all ability to talk to your smart watch and issue voice commands is broken, even when I tried to disable the power save functions of this app entirely.  Maybe this is a bug introduced since the Moto 360 got a FW update last week?  Please fix ASAP, great concept here, thanks.",

        "comment": "Why does this keyboard app was not updating frequently? It would have been better if this app supports more language because this keyboard depends on autocorrect function so countries like in the Philippines where we cannot fully used this app because it doesn't have tagalog.. We can only depend on inputting our own languages so it takes more time in the few months I think before you can be comfortable on using this keyboard.. So it takes so long.. This app has so much potential.. I've been following minuum since it started here i think that was 3-4 yrs ago but since last year im not using it because I was waiting for more support of languages..",

        "comment": "I really like the concept of this keyboard. The prediction works very well and once you get used to typing on it you can type at a pretty decent speed. The main issue I have is not being able to move the cursor with the spacebar. While the amazing prediction removes some of the need for this feature, if you want to go back and correct a word it can be hard to get the cursor positioned correctly without this. Otherwise this is an excellent keyboard,  especially if you use split window and hate how the top window is almost completely off screen while typing.",

Don't be afraid to expand it if speed and accuracy are paramount or using esoteric terminology - which I did NOT for this edit.)  Not bad. I assume most reviewers are giving feedback in same day as purchasing. I say give it time and it will become easier.",

However, one huge caveat is the lack of different languages. I would love to start using this keyboard, but until Danish (and Icelandic) is supported, it is a no go. I bought this app before it was out of beta solely on its promise, so I hope these two languages finds their way onto the roadmap soon.",

Themes are also pretty nice. You can customize the size of both the shrunken keyboard and the expanded one. There are many other settings to fit the keyboard around your preferences. Also they do not take any data from what you type, as all phrases are stored locally in your phone. At least, that's what they say. There are no accounts to sync any info of your previous settings to a new device, so that may be an issue for some. However, privacy is more important.",

Maybe I just can't find them, but the keyboard layout is different on the screenshot than it actually is, is there a way to customize it?

Also swiping for the special characters takes some time and is not always accurate, can a long press be enough if you just want the first or only special character assigned to the letter?

Yes, it does make mistakes sometimes but not all time and most if the time of works pretty good. Apart of this sentence was typed  without looking at the keyboard and most of the time it chooses the right words.  I'm pretty happy with sometimes it thinks that I finished typing a word of it adds the space way too early and that can be pretty frustrating,  but nothing is perfect and this does the job most of the time.",

It even learns your typing and gets better at correcting typos. It's not the easiest keyboard to use but it leaves so much more screen space for your apps that sometimes it's essential. Amazing tool for guys like me who use apps that get blocked by the keyboard.",

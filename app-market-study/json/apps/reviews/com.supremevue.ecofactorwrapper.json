The update provided about 4 days ago seems to have solved my connection problem so I've raised my rating to 4.  If it holds, I'll probably give it a 5.  I would like the option of not overriding an energy event but still control the raising of temps at all other times.  We did get these thermostats free for this reason, after all.",

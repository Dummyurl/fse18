I compared this to a garmin GPS and I was easy 2km/hr fast at live speeds but my average speeds where spot on and th e distance. So nothing wrong with my phone. Perhaps something to look into. Also perhaps atleast a demo version of the full app could be worth it in the long run.",

It is totally unreliable. I could work with the app if support would work with me, but support did not respond after I emailed for assistance.

The app tracked my entire workout and told me every minute the time of the workout, the heart rate, whether it was fat burning, aerobic or anaerobic, and the calories burned. I thought it was great. After the workout, I tried to view it and it wasn't there. There was no workout that I could find. I went to the website and there was nothing. WTF!! It looks like an App, it sounds like an App, but it seems to be Crap. There's no help feature and no customer support. It's a big fat nothing! They talk a good game though!  I guess the bottom line is that the App I used is the \"free\" App, but to get the be paid via PayPal.free app to do what the website says it can do, $5 must must be paid via PayPal. Huh????.",

        "comment": "I can't believe how well this app works!  I have a Moto X and had problems with my Polar H7 maintaining connection with other apps like Polar Beat and Pear.  I was a user of Endomondo but now use this... The audible announcements and customizable training plans are what set this app apart from other more popular apps.  1/9/2014:  Over the last couple of days, I experienced erratic behavior with ALL heart monitor related apps.  At first I thought that it had something to do with my Polar H7, but I'm pretty certain that it had to do with the most recent update to Motorola Connect (standard software on my Moto X).  The software had updated automatically on 1/7, just around the time that I started having problems.  After uninstalling all updates to Motorola Connect, everything works perfectly.",

I could give a rip about social connectivity and \"connecting\" with people for my workouts and your app allows tracking of the pertinent factors.   I hope I can still use the app even if you have to shut down the service.",

It sucks.",

There were a couple hiccups during setup, but the support team is extremely helpful. If you have inlaid door frames, contact support and they will send you free magnets that work with said door frames.   The app itself works great, the widgets are awesome, the notifications work if the alarm is tripped. IFTTT and/or some Tasker and AutiInput integration, and you can really do some cool stuff. I am definitely happy with the purchase.   One downside: OK Google input doesn't work on my Nexus 6. It just performs a Google search for the command.",

It would be nice if there was a \"refresh\", or \"sync\" button, since alarm status and monitor notifications do not always update. Often I need to log out and then back in in order for the app to show me the current alarm status.",

This causes the app to be non responsive and pressing the lock buttons does nothing when it's hung up. I usually have to check online to see if it actually armed or not because I don't trust the app.",

Update 5/28. It was Memorial Day weekend, so I wasn't expecting an immediate response.  Got one Tuesday, and the app was updated  and fixed the issue.  Only complaint is the Activity Log doesn't update real quick. Even pulling the page down to force an update doesn't get new records. Lags a bit.",

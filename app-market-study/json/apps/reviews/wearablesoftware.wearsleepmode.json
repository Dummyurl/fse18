        "comment": "To reply to earlier comments unlike LCD oled which most smart watches and phones use.  Oled Doesn't activate the pixels on black so this keeps you oled screen from firing up and drawing power.  LCD screens do draw power when it is showing black.  As for burn in if the oled are not active then you shouldn't have a problem and most devices rotate the pixels in a pattern to prevent this any how.  Great app so far no problems on asus zenwatch 2 the only thing that doesn't work is ok Google",

Just get \"unfortunately screensaver stopped\" everytime I try to start it. Its also a little strange that theres no icon in the app drawer on the phone.  EDIT:  Definitely not an installation problem. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. It shows up in Wear Apps Manager, but still force closes on watch. Im on a Nexus 5 LPX13D, if that matters.",

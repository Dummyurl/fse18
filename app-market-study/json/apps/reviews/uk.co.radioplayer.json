        "comment": "Before the latest update it was just about perfect with the ability to change radio stations with the steering wheel controls in the car which with the new mobile phone law of 6 points and a \u00a3200 fine was the main reason I use the app. Now it's just like all the rest with the risk of breaking the law if I want to change radio stations, can you please sort this?  Update. Hi thanks for the reply, I have tried all the things you mentioned but still I can't use the car controls with the new update. I connect my phone via Bluetooth to the car radio system and so long as I click the favourites tab on the Radioplayer app I could select each station by using the steering wheel controls. Since the update it has not worked but this morning I searched for the previous version )March 2017) of the app in apk form downloaded it, installed it and now can use the steering wheel controls again to select stations. Kind regards",

It would be good to know a bit more about how you're using the app. Are you using Bluetooth to switch stations (this should still work), or Android Auto (this should still work), or Car Mode? The latter is now easily accessed via the playbar (black band at bottom of app). Tap to expand it, and tap the icon with 4 squares.",

You are not bombarded with ads. When via car Bluetooth you can use steering wheel controls to skip though my chosen favourite stations. When I get out the car and get back in the radio starts again automatically. If I switch to a different input the app will automatically pause playback to save data and auto restarts when you go back to Bluetooth source. Top radio app for sure.",

With this app on my Three network handset, I get strong, steady streams all over the UK. The app's also great for picking up local stations from afar on my travels. I like that I can use Forward/Next on my car's steering wheel control to cycle through the stations I have set up as favourties. I find the Chromecast support and the sleep timer genuinely useful too in the home. The only thing missing that I'd like to see is an ability to sync Favourites lists across multiple devices. But as it stands it's a true gem, this app.",

        "comment": "One of the best radio apps available.  Although, it has a tendency to crash - resulting in me having to uninstall, then reinstall the app.  I often enjoy listening to 'catch-up' programmes, however, it sometimes crashes for no apparent reason and, when I try to restart it - it just goes straight back to the very beginning of the show I had been listening to.  Additionally, if I pause a show for a few minutes, when I attempt to get back to the exact point of the programme that I had stopped at, it keeps saying 'Sorry, that catch-up item is not available at the moment.'  Consequently, I have to wait several hours to access that particular programme again.  Very frustrating.   The concept is great, but needs a bit of tweaking for it to be functional and more user friendly.  Could also do with a timer /clock on the app, making it easier to navigate to a certain point during a 'catch-up' programme. Definitely room for improvement, but still remains a personal favourite of mine.",

Also appears as one of the top battery draining apps. Even askng android to put it to sleep doesn't stop it! Never used to behave like this",

Funded through taxation but firewalling all their material like a private business with profits to protect. Can't have it both ways. Its time to cut the BBC loose and let it go head to head with Netflix and Amazon Prime. All previous programming of an educational nature should be immediately placed in the public domain for free access, anywhere. Afterall, it belongs to the UK taxpayer.",

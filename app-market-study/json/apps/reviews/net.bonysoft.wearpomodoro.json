        "comment": "Edit: time remaining now fits on the screen. Great work. Original review follows: On my moto360, the text doesn't fit in on the card preview, so I don't see the last digit of the minutes remaining. And when the vibration occurs, the card still says \"one minute remaining\" for another minute or so. But other than that, works as advertised.",

        "comment": "THIS IS THE BEST! I would gladly pay for more features though.  Not only it it works flawlessly.  This tiny app sets the long and the short breaks automatically and continually.  My favorite thing is that there's no need to keep tapping Start like most Pomodoro apps and even PC apps. That is super useful to hopeless procrastinators because I can't extend my 5 minute break. I have to rush to keep working on my Pomodoro, which is already running. Genius!    It could have more features though. Like a PC/phone companion to log the pomodoros, customization to set the Pomodoro blocks, data export/import, Dropbox/Drive compatibility, etc.  Great job!",

        "comment": "I've tested a few pomo apps for Wear and this is by far the most convenient one. However now I realize that the standard 25/5 timing is too short for me so I want to change it. If there is a settings menu in this app it's too well hidden. Looks like until it's there I'll have to switch to another app :( Other feature that would make this a 5+ app would be automatic start/stop on schedule. But, regardless of anything, thanks for this awesome app!",

However, if you do want to change the location, you can go into the settings and enable VPN Mode. This will open a prompt where you can directly add in coordinates for the location you're choosing. Let me know if this works",

I had to open the Remote Control app on my phone and experiment to find the only way that worked: opening the keyboard and hitting the Enter/Done button. Otherwise it seems to work well enough. Being able to see where the app thinks my device is located when in the daydream view would be nice. Does the daydream show more detail in premium mode?",

I have 40\u00b0 set as hot and 12\u00b0 as cold and I just got a notification saying it will be very hot at 15\u00b0. Thought this would be fixed long ago but kept the app around and it still hasn't been addressed. Daydream also is just in nonstandard (I refuse to validate it) measurements with no option to switch to metric",

It's weird that you're getting a notification for 15\u00b0 and I'll definitely investigate why that's happening. As for daydreams, I'll also check that out. It should use whichever system you pick though.",

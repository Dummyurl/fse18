However I have two suggestions: it would be nice to change colors for each screen (not really a complaint but hey I'm a big fan of customization). The second tip is to improve the interface just a little bit more by giving us the option to go back a screen just in case we make a mistake. Maybe a simple swipe back might be enough.",

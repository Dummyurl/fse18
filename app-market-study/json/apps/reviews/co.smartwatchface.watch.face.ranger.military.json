        "comment": "I really didn't start enjoying my Android Wear watch until I installed the Ranger watch face. First of all, it has a custom square face that fits my watch precisely. It truly is always on unlike most watch faces. In addition to the time in regular and 24 hour format, it provides not only the day and the date, but also the temperature, the weather, and the status of your watch or phone batteries. Other watch faces seem limited in comparison.",

        "comment": "(I should have read the short review by Mr. Austin before buying it.)  Its a beautiful watch face. Really nice looking and presents data perfectly.  But...  The compass and battery complications (while extremely useful and one of the reasons I bought it) will burn through battery like there's no tomorrow.  Disable these and you'll be fine.  But then, of course, your phone stock face will probably do the job equally well (with a much less \"cool\" quotient of course), for $1 less.  Buy it to show off/use, once in a while. Not for regular use.",

It might be an Android Wear issue too but adding the ability to lock down your configuration would help a lot.",

I've edited this review a few times, praise, then frustration with battery issues on AW 2 and now back to praise. Until quite recently (11/17 edit here) my 2nd gen Moto 360 with this face wouldn't make it through to even afternoon, let alone evening. A recent update though (not sure when it was) changed all of that and now I get to the end of TWO DAYS and still have 30% or so battery left. Really, remarkable fix guys. Thanks!",

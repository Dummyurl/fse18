This app will keep it from launching random apps and stopping your music while you run/cycle in the rain  I would love to have a \"Sleep time\" version of this app, with only the time. Have \"Baby Time On\", date and \"swipe up ...\" text removed. Maybe lower the brightness to minimum too. My usual watch faces are too bright for night time. And when I move, they accidentally brighten up to normal mode, flooding the bedroom with light and waking me up.",

It doesn't stop 'swipe to open' apps - namely Mini Launcher and Bubble Launcher - not sure if this is just an impossibility of Wear, but if it could be done this would be 5*. Also is tricky to unlock sometimes, but would rather that than too easy.",

First, the watch face flashes into view each time the screen goes from off to the lock screen, which is still too interesting for my three-year-old to resist. Second, it seems to want to keep the screen on most of the time, even though I have \"always on\" switched off. It also seems to light up on a wrist flick, even when I have the watch muted, so it should require a tap to light up. Still very good, though.",

If the time could be changed to the 12 hour display (am/pm) instead of 24 hr time that would be great. Also, it once activated, the screen remains in ambient mode (which can KILL the Moto 360). If the screen timeout could be fixed, that would be huge! Those two fixes would equal 5 stars. Great app.",

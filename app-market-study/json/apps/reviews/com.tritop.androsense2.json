        "comment": "Promising and useful app for researchers. One table for each sensor and GPS table structure are just great: clean and organized. However, if missed some features: collect data in background, multi-sensor logging, settings for data collection rate and maybe window size. I suggest to move the \"Log\" buttons to the first screen (the would work as check-boxes) and one START button to initialize the data collection.",

For now Androsensor has far better ui and functionality.Although here graphs and GPS NMEA are unique features. Also not all possible sensors are used.",

        "comment": "This new version is much better. The scrolling display is easy to read, and the GPS feature is fun. My only complaint is that the zooming feature does not zoom about the origin, but rather about the middle of the plot. So if the data ranges from 1 to 10 and the plot is from 0 to 1000, zooming gives me a window from 450 to 550, which is not particularly helpful. Platform:Nexus5/android4.4(KitKat) sensors affected: magnetometer, accelerometer.",

I will say that it was excellent when I was in the US tracking the hurricanes, Katrina, Irma etc.  Consistantly better than other apps on my wife and daughters phones",

The problem was NOT about accurate weather reporting but that tha app has a set response to good visability which it always interprets as GOOD driving weather. This could be DANGEROUS. It should take into account of ICE and HIGH WINDS too. This is a SAFETY MATTER so please address this promptly with an update.  Hope this updated review helps.",

Otherwise, this is a fantastic app whenever I need to tune my guitar!",

I also got really good results in a noisy room by pressing the watch bezel (gently) against the neck to get a reading, and then dialing it in. Not as quick, but it worked. Also, as the noise died down, it seems like the vibration from the tuning peg transferring through my fingers were helping it. I'm sure this is stuff that you know, but still pretty neat.

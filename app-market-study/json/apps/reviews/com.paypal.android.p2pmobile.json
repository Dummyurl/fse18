Twice now my account has been limited for \"sexually oriented content\" and things that could be considered \"obscene\". I didn't realize kate spade or tiffany's themed bridal shower items or \"it's a boy\" or \"its a girl\" baby shower items fall under that category. Let alone sports decals with kids names on them. This time my account has been permanently limited and there's no phone number to talk to the individuals I need to speak with. Those you can talk to by phone can't do anything for you. I've emailed those who I'd need to speak to about this and they don't reply to any of the emails. Once you're account is limited you can't get any money from your account for a minimum of 180 days. If you're looking to run a small business with PayPal I strongly suggest against it. Go with a company that doesn't randomly accuse people of things.",

        "comment": "Have been using PayPal for years on my phone and Galaxy S2. Now, I can NOT use it on my tablet because it tells me to update the app. When I try clicking on the update link. It goes to the play store and that says the app is not compatible with my device. Running Android 7.0 on both devices but only works on my phone. Can't find out what's wrong from customer service and can't use the app. WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THIS????",

I encourage everyone that updated this app to the latest broken version to call them as that may be the only way to get them on it asap.

        "comment": "App is completely screwed up on Galaxy Tab S2 since a recent update. I couldn't update it (said 'this version is not compatible with your device') although it was already installed and working fine. I was also receiving a pop-up telling me that I needed to upgrade, but when I tapped on the upgrade button it just took me to the Play Store where I received the same message. I'm also unable to leave comments for the app through my tablet (getting an 'error retrieving information from the server' error). Something in a new release really screwed the app up and until it's completely resolved, I will be leaving my rating at 1 star. I rely on it when I use my tablet and it's completely useless right now.",

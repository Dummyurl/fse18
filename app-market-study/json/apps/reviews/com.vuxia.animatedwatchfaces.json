UPDATE: lowered my original rating because i still have not seen any updated faces. i paid the full amount to have all the faces and have seen nothing. these are great faces and look nice but stick with the basic faces and don't waste your money.",

There is one problem I have found on my moto 360: the time is not centered horizontally on the face; it's off to the right. Fix this, and this is an easy 5 stars!!",

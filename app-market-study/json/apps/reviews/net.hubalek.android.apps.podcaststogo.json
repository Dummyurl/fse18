However, there are a few specific things missing from making it a \"GREAT\" app.  Firstly, it does not play video for video podcasts; this app is audio only. Secondly, there is no easy way to \"fast forward\". To bring up the \"scroll bar\", you must first pause the currently playing audio; then the scroll bar pops up. Of course, after you then click play, the scroll bar never goes away.",

I wish the search/keyword  were a little more evident.  I was also hoping that I could have the option to limit the number of podcasts to store, for example, maybe only keep the 2 or 3 most recent, to save on storage, but I am sure that could be provided in the future.  It looks like they are working on saving to external SD card so that will be great when implemented.  One question, after I mark a podcast as read, is it deleted?",

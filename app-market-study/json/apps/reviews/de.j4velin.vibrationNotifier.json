Skype created the notifications in the bar and I selected to add it manually..  I had other notification intercept things running but disabled all of them including android wear's own stock application. The only application with notification access now is this one and even with doing all that and resetting my smart watch and having skype spammed (my phone is on vibrate only) and I have the \"send to android wear device only\" checkbox checked, I still get nothing. I really like the design I just wish it DID something. This is probably a rare case as My device is actually a samsung gear S2 or whatever flashed from Tizen to Android Wear ...",

I'm a bit deaf so it helps a lot. Only thing I would like to change about the app is to have it done in seconds and not milliseconds as it would be easier to use. But Great app so far",

        "comment": "I have mixed feelings about this app.  I feel like the free app app is deceptive. If you want to actually use it to change the vibrations on your watch you have to purchase it. I uninstalled the free app immediately and downloaded \"Feel The Wear\" where a number of their functions are free. However, Feel The Wear felt like it weakened the strength of the vibration on my Moto 360. (The problem I'm trying to solve.)  So I came back and decided to buy this app.  It's very simple, easy to use and straightforward.  It doesn't intensify the vibration (but I don't think anything can).  And the feature to keep notifying you until you respond is perfect.  For a buck that's not bad.",

But when I click on the settings it has a setting for it to vibrate on the watch even when the phone is on silent. It won't vibrate on my watch when the phone is on silent though but I need it to. I just paid for this app and it wont even work for what it says it will.",

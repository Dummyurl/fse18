No major syncing issues helping me stay OmniFocused when away from my computer.   Cons: Still has more features it needs to add. Missing the ability to set custom due dates and custom repeating options. Also I would really love there to be a calendar view option.    10/ 24/ 2016 UPDATED:   Now Steve won't respond to emails. It completely won't work and he won't get back to me so it's wasted money. DON'T BUY.",

Steven got back to me very quickly about my questions and suggestions - which is quite impressive! As a new application, it needs some work (which he is obviously doing!) but is still quite usable - I think it is fair to say that this is an investment in a good app that has the promise of being a great app. As long as we don't have to pay another $12.99 for the next version, it is money well spent! Update: This app kept promising but never came through. The developer promised to make all sorts of improvements and its still barely functional with basic things like repeating tasks. I'm so tired of this app I never use it anymore.",

I really missed Omnifocus, though, so I tried Quantus Tasks.  The first version I tried wasn't working well enough so I switched back to Toodledo, but then they did a lot of work on Quantus Tasks that I went back to it and even paid for an upgrade to Omnifocus 2.  I use QA for two main things: seeing what tasks I have to do and entering simple tasks.  It does a great job at both of these and I haven't had any problems.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does not handle repeating tasks very well, and I have to make sure I don't check them off  the will be closed without repeating.  Aside from that QA works well and the developer is actively adding features.  I'm glad to be back on Omnifocus, with the help of Quantus Tasks.",

This app does that perfectly and seamlessly.  It's not a fully featured client, but that's not what I need.  I use Box so I am grateful that this has WebDAV support too.  Good job and please keep developing this app!",

As a developer you've been incredibly responsive and have rolled out a few nice updates. I appreciate your roadmap and your commitment to making this even more robust still.  Thank you.",

When I add something to my inbox it freezes the app. Currently my projects list is empty on my phone despite having dozens of projects on Omnifocus server. Steven at Quantas has yet to respond to any of my messages. This app is so buggy and hardly works for me at all on my Nexus 5. I wonder how it got all these positive reviews. I hardly post reviews on apps but this one is very poor.",

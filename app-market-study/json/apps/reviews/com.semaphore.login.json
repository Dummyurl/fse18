This app is so convenient for the fact that the client can find the time and day that works for both of us without me spending my time tying to accommodate their schedule. It's a lifesaver! I have shaved a few hours off my work hours by using VagaroPro. Also, I am able to make notes on each client and keep track of inventory. I do spray tans so I am able to track the colors I use and notate which ones are their favorite. Definitely recommend this app!",

        "comment": "Compafing to all other scheduling software Vagaro has an edge by providing free \"book now\"  integration with Yelp. There is some minor irritating things to be fixed like - Vagaro states that Credit card processing is same as Square but they charge you yearly Master Card fee that Square does not. Also there is room for improvement in \"daily deal\" section. Would love to see \"last minute deal\" option to be able to fill specicic spots on the fly for ur day. All in all it is a great tool and essential to my business as independent massage therapist.",

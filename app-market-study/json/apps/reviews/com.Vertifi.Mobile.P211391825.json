        "comment": "When I first used the app to deposit my checks on my Nexus 6, everything worked great, but the last few months the app and the Nexus 6 have had issues with the back of the check being too dark. I believe there is a bug that is causing this, as the check image is very clear. I am not able to change the brightness on the back and it kicks me out. I have tried many different backrounds and none work. It takes sometimes 30 minutes to find the right distance which is usually around 2 feet above the check. I find this to be unnecessary and suggesting a bug in the app or flaw in the submission program. I can provide most checks over the last year and assist in solving this via email or in person.  Response: I am deeply disappointed in this response. I will not accept a form letter reply, knowing what I have previously stated was not read. I am well aware I should be much closer, but as I stated before, it will not work on the back unless I am at least 2 feet away. THERE IS A BUG PREVENTING ME FROM DEPOSITING A CHECK DUE TO THE BACK SIDE BEING TOO DARK. I CAN NOT ADJUST THE BRIGHTNESS AND IT ALWAYS KICKS ME OUT. I DID NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE 6 MONTHS AGO AND I DO NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH CAPITAL ONE BANKING. IT IS AN APP ISSUE!",

They won't load, then if I press the reload icon they take up to 10 seconds to load and I am connected to my fast home WiFi. Also the app doesn't allow me to delete messages after they're read. The ATM/ branch locator is helpful but the hours get listed horizontally and much of the info is cut off and non-viewable. I would also like to be able to change the default view on my account transactions to 90 days bc I always want to see more than the default 30 days and I dislike having to change the starting date every time.  The check deposit works flawlessly, though. Kudos for that.",

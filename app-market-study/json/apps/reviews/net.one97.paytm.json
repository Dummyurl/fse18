I am contacting them from last 3 days but they didn't solve my problem and i also message them on Help & Support but i didn't get any reply. I am facing a problem in KYC verification. Whenever i try to verify my KYC it always shows error. I am using Paytm from last many years i never expect that type of service from Paytm. I am very disappointed with Paytm.",

Query ref no: 54312563 Now they are saying to wait for 14 days , and if not received then contact to bank.  If they are not able to refund or recharge then why paytm is looting people hard earned money.  There is no any customer support. Totally fake app",

Couldn't book ticket only becuse of you people sending alow OPTs. Moreover taking so much time log in also. And when booking tickets through your app it IRCTC account verifying but nothing happens. Please provide connecting account to IRCTC app permanently. Saves time to log in and pay.",

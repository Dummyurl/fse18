Without these crucial bits of data, it's practically useless as an expense tracker. I can never remember what the money was spent for when I look at a contextually deficient list of amounts and dates a few days later.",

Also, if there's a persistent notification that can be accessed to bring up the expense calculator, it would make the logging task simpler and would improve its relevance. In addition, the UI seems too simple; might lead users to believe that its functionality/utility is limited",

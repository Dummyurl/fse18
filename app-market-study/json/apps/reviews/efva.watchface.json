I don't know what might be causing it,  unless it's the quotes that randomly appear.  I love what the quotes have to say,  in fact that's one of my favorite parts.  However they don't stay long enough to be able to read the tiny text.  I guess it's a good thing they appear often.  If the battery issue is fixed I'll gladly change to a 5 as this is my favorite!",

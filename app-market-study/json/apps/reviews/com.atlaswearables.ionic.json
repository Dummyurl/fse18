Update - this thing once had potential but now it genuinely sucks. They've essentially abandoned it for their next tracker. The app hasn't been updated in months and neither has the firmware. Not even worth the $50 you can get it for on Amazon now.",

        "comment": "It's perfection. The perfect work out tracker. Freestyle is the way to go. It automatically detects what exercise you're doing and counts the reps. If you're doing an exercise that it does not recognize you can set a custom exercise and teach the device to recognize the movements but it does take about three times of teaching it for it to pick it up perfectly sometimes four times that's not a problem. This device works perfectly I am on my second wristband 2 the reason why I'm on my second one because the first one I bought I carried it around in my backpack everywhere I went and it caused a device to quit working properly. I think it's because since this is a motion detector that if you wear it or carry it around when you are not using it it jams up the sensing mechanisms and detection software so I would like to let everyone know and I think you should let everyone know that this wristband 2 should only be worn during a workout when you're not using it put it in a place where it's not going to be moving around I'll just keep it on your wrist all the time or keep it in a backpack. I only wear it for your workout teach it what it does not know when you are not working out put it in a place where it will not move and the device will stay working perfectly and if you are teaching it a custom exercise and teach it to where it's high-quality at least 3 or 4 times and delete the medium and poor quality teaching. I love this device and I strongly recommended and endorse it",

Less than 6months old and handled with extreme care, even had a soft bag to store it. Obviously update broke it. DO NOT BUY.  Update. Hangs at synching in app even if it connects it NEVER SYNCS FIX IT quick or I will change grade on amazon too.   OLD REVIEW This can become the best gadget EV =) +ups+ 1. Fantastic overview to quickly see muscles that need more focus 2.Fantastic details on history even showing velocity 3.Awesome teach mode -downs- 1.Android back button does not work in app and we android users HATE to be forced to use in app (apple style) back button ;) 2.Syncing is very slow (20~30s) 3.When selecting exercises from the long list and choosing to watch firm video, the list jumps back to top of list when going back, it should jump back to current selection to prevent scroll mania 4. Scrolling is very choppy. Sometimes nothing happens, sometimes it scrolls a full page 5.When creating routines you should be able to say how many sets, instead of creating I.e. 4 entries/sets one by one with same data.this to minimize scrolling and save time (or copy a row). 6.Phone heats up like crazy when using app, something is using loads of cpu. 7.my band don't seem to recognize bar exercises like chins 8.App is now SUUUPER  when moving between historic workouts and menus 9. Videos take forever to load even on 4g and wifi.@proposal@Add possibility to touch muscle group in overview (I.e. One you have not trained a lot) and based on that selection, give example list of exercises and allow to create workout from that list.perfect for both beginners and old school that needs new exercises This band and app has great potential, fix above and its 5 stars easy =) I'm really hyped about its future and glad I tried it and if it continues to develop I'm sure it will be a success.a scratch resistant glass is a must though, mine is already slightly scuffed after one gym session. Will try to find screenprotector for the non curved part at least.@LOL@reading the description here in ANDROID play store it says wireless sync with iPhone5 and up...hahaha what about us android users.

        "comment": "After the updates, this product is better and more functional. Originally gave 1 star and thought it was basically an expansive heart rate monitor. Seemed to have so much promise, and it is finally getting there! If you want this, read the reviews so you know what you are getting. Will review again once more updates are done.",

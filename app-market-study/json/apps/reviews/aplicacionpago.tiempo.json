        "comment": "Works with android 4.04. Good presentations of forecasts: the continuous graphical display in landscape mode is very well designed, clear, simple but with complete information. Needs the Google Play Services hog to display maps, but don't require it to display forecasts. Many settings are adjustable. ECMWF based Forecasts as good as others (southern France Mediterranean), and sometimes definitively better than ones based on GFS and WMF models. Data consumption reasonable. Data for the favorite locations is stored for future use (even without Internet connection). One negative point  (hence 4 stars instead of 5): only 10 locations stored (Winfinder, Windguru and Meteoconsult don't have this limitation). An other negative point, shared by several other weather applications, is the lack of date an time of the prediction (Winfinder and Windguru show the date and time of the weather model run, while Meteo Consult and many others don't show this info).",

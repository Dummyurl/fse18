Amazing really, hadn't used this app from Google for a long time. Only thing missing is unit conversion and currency calculator.",

I much prefer this to the stock calculator on my s8.",

If you have an equation you're typing in and want to clear the whole thing (before hitting enter) you have to delete every single number one by one and it makes it sorta time consuming. Maybe I'm just overlooking this? I would love that too be the case because I enjoy the app, but it's just missing that one button.",

Please add complex numbers, quaternions, matrices, arbitrary radix (or at least binary, octal, hexadecimal, and sexagesimal), polynomial solution (or guided simplification), differentiation, integration, and general algebraic manipulation. Real calculators use postfix application of single-operand functions. Not doing so makes it awkward to do calculations in multiple steps (which is sensible to check for errors): tap to insert prefix operators, and tap again to add closing brackets, each time risking mis-locating the cursor. Maybe for people who don't check partial results (or who've never used a real calculator) this isn't an issue, but I find it really awkward. Also, eww yuck, commas between thousands. And the paged swipe thing is just weird too. Please give me the option to uninstall pre-installed apps, or at least mark them as \"hide, don't update, and don't remind me about updates\".",

Also, I liked the previous color scheme, that's gone too!  However it still beats the EMUI one that comes with my device! \ud83d\ude09",

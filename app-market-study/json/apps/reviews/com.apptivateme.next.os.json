I feel like I finally know what's going on in Orlando. $7.99 / month is totally worth it to keep in touch with the community. I already pay $15 / month for the NY Times, so I think this is reasonable. If we want quality journalism in the city we love, we should expect to pay something for it.",

But lately, I have grown frustrated with the app. Often when I open it, it seems to get stuck. When I get email news alerts and click the links, my phone opens the app but can never find the right story. The ads are really annoying and intrusive, given that I've paid for a subscription. I think the OS could do better. The NYT has an excellent app, and the WaPo app isn't bad either. (The NYT app even displays reader comments, which the OS app has never done.)",

A better choice, but at a cost, may be the Orlando Sentinel's web edition with full graphics. It's offered free with a traditional home delivery paid subscription. This feature bypasses the app altogether, arriving by email around 5:30am every morning. It is smartphone friendly and very convenient. I love it! (Contact the Orlando Sentinel for details. If subscribing, be patient during the sometimes tedious email setup and learning curve...but worth the effort.)",

UPDATE: They released another update, but now, instead of all articles being considered premium (a likely mistake), you are now only able to view 10 articles a month for free. So essentially no change but to confirm that the app is worthless. I'll be going to a new source for news I guess.",

It's like no one is bothering to figure out what constitutes top news vs. breaking news.  The same story appears multiple times with different dates.  Sometimes photos appear with no text.  Sometimes a photo icon that shows up in story link does not show up in larger form when you open up the story.  Compared to other newspaper apps, this one sucks.",

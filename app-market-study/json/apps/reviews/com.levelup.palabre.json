I have finally found my solution.  I have a wide variety of interests. The problem is, how do I explore topics without getting bogged down with the sheer volume of information being thrown at me? Solution? This app.  I added each one of my YouTube subscriptions and other sites as RSS feeds into feedly and organized them by genre. I then added them onto this app and added a widget to my homescreen. Perfect organization.  This also has a widget that lets you view your feed based off of your twitter lists! No other app I could find did this. On top of that, the widget has images! Just absolutely exactly what I was looking for.  So far, it is smooth and functioning well for me. I'm sure it does even more than I have discovered.  This app is awesome.",

The first week after I installed it it worked great and I considered it to be a worthy successor to Feedly, which I've been having problems with for a long time.  That lasted a week. Now I can start the app and read a few articles before I start hitting slowdown. First the article scrolling will either freeze or go really slow, and then when you back out into the feed it'll continue to do the same thing. On top of that, using it regularly crashes my phone. When it freezes, it freezes my entire phone, either hard rebooting it or forcing me to restart it.   With a little extra work and a few extra features this could be an amazing Feedly substitute. But from what I've read in the reviews, it seems that these problems have been going on for awhile and likely won't be fixed. Time to look for another substitute.",

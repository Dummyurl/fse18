        "comment": "I like the easy way of executing tasks on the phone from my wear but I think a few minor improvements are welcome. First I would like to bookmark tasks in order to execute them faster, now it's just an alphabetic list of the tasks. This could be more efficient. Second I would like the app to close itself after executing a task, now it just returns to the list of tasks. I thinks these are minor improvements that would make the experience more refined, something I expect of a paid app. Nice job!",

        "comment": "This is letting me bypass the whole IFTTT/Pushbullet workaround I've been using to fire Tasks on my Phone from my Watch. Only a couple of issues I noticed: 1. Firing a Task automatically launches the Tasker for Wear app on the phone. IT'd be nice if it didn't do that - I have been using a wait/kill stipulation to get it to leave though. 2. When I created a new Project I was getting an error. I had to play around and it fixed itself, so sometimes it seems a little unstable. Nonetheless, this is awesome.  Updated to 5 Stars. Dev appreciated feedback and implemented it in to the application quickly. Great support!",

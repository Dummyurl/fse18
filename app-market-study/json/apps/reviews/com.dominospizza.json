I don't order a lot of pizza, but when I do I usually order two at a time I think this type of Kickback for app users only would benefit tremendously I know the developer doesn't work exclusively with Domino's but it would be nice to at least get a recommendation for this change to them. Thank you for your time. You have a wonderful day! Chad",

The ability to reorder a saved selection is great especially since you can just start with it and modify it from there if you want anything different, and it saves whatever coupon you were using. The pizza tracker is extremely useful (even if it feels like a timer that automatically transitions between states without someone actually triggering it manually), particularly for when it tells you when the driver left the store with your pizza, you can get the feel for how long it should take. The only change I would recommend would be a map which shows the driver's general location to get an even better idea of when they will be arriving, which us great if you don't plan to be hanging around within earshot of your front door (e.g. upstairs/downstairs or outside).",

Very clean layout. It has the ability to store locations and payment details; as well as,  gives you coupons and ability to earn towards free pizzas.  It's reliable and well integrated.",

Do I bask and bathe in the glory of all that is pizza? Yes. YES. YESSS! If i had only one food to shovel into my gullet for the rest of eternity it would be Dominos. If dominos were a person, i would totally kidnap them and force them into servitude to forever make me delicious affordable treats. And have you had the lava cakes? Jesus. Christ. I dont know what i wouldnt do for one of those chocolatey bastards. They are so good, if your not ready for it, it can very well drive you to crazy depression due to the fact you cant be the lava cake itself.",

        "comment": "Definitely a convenient app. I do like that they have coupons that apply, though even if you don't apply them the price is the same so is it REALLY a coupon? And EVERY TIME I order on the app and purchase additional sauces, they never bring them! If you are going to make people pay extra money for sauces, then it would be nice to actually receive them. I love their food, I've just had this complication with the app for over a year and maybe adding a way to leave notes/messages on orders in the app would would be helpful.",

It will also show you was of saving money with suggesting special offers you may not have been aware of. With it's online Order Tracker, you'll always know what the status of your order is and that, in itself, makes the waiting time feel like a breeze. GREAT IDEA Domino's!! .. overall I give this app the full 5 stars. And recommend it to anyone looking for a simple but extremely helpful way to order a pizza.",

        "comment": "This is the notes app to get, especially if you are a Dropbox user. Not much to say really. Works wonderfully! The only thing o_O I could wish for is to be able to save a note without closing it. I have now been using this app for a couple of years and it's on my very small list of must-have apps. A great addition is that you can access you notes in your web browser also. The only thing I miss is to be able to print notes from my phone. Just buy it. It's so worth it supporting development of this great app! After another couple of years this is still one of my most used apps. Just updated and better than ever. Please make the web interface searchable! I keep updating this review since this app is one of the best and most used app on my phone.",

Works as expected, although ever since I updated to Oreo it closes after adding/editing a note or unlocking the app. Hopefully it'll be fixed soon",

        "comment": "I like it. But I keep getting conflicted versions from todo lists synced with Dropbox, despite the fact that I'm only editing and viewing the files in the app on a single device. So why are there conflicted versions? Perhaps this happens when I edit a list while offline and then the older Dropbox version is considered to be conflicting while in my opinion it just should be overwritten because it's older. This is a bit of an annoyance.",

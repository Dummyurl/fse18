The ambient screen dims and the only thing to disappear of the sweep second hand. Battery life does not appear to be affected but have not had app long. I will update if any significant findings. The problem I have with the analog watch faces, in general, is the hands cover the info at certain times. Suggest make mini distinctive hour and minute hands at the outer edge so as not to cover any info.Thx!",

You are right regarding the hands overlapping the widgets in analog watch faces. We have an idea on how to resolve this and we're going to suggest it in the next version.",

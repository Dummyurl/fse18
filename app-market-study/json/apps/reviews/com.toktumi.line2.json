You need to clear your cache, make sure you turn off your automatic backup and restore on the app and then un install and re-install again. That took care of my issue.",

If you create a ticket at support.line2.com we'll help you figure out what's causing it.

        "comment": "As of 16 hours ago, Line2 has been down due to a DDoS attack. Not acceptable, nothing in place to protect from this type of thing. Feeling very disappointed right now. This could go on for days, maybe longer. On the edge of transferring my number. Other than that, was liking the app.  Update...Since the latest update, my Line2 app does not receive incoming messages or calls when away from my wifi network. Arghh! I have to place an outgoing call to receive my incoming messages. Arghhh! FIX THIS PLEASE!",

Cannot select my own rington anymore - only phone preset ones :( 2.when selecting tone-key options, the screen supports a screen width only, and if you have to enter more selections: you don't see anymore what you're typing. 3. When you are on tone-key pad- you cannot amore terminate the call easy: have to go back to the main screen first.",

It might work better in an office setting, but very poor over cellular phone (especially when not connected to wifi).  They would not prorate any refund at the end either.  Overall, poor experience.",

I have an app sugestion: a note pad in wich you can acess your notes on the watch(I have found one that does that yet) with a key board thats is like a rotary phone. What I mean is a rim that you rotate and then tap the middle to place character. I hope you use my suggestion, and thanks for a great calculator.",

Since running this watch face my watch has run out of battery in half the time it usually does, this has happened two or three times. I don't know if it us this app, but I haven't installed anything else in that time period. Nobody else has mentioned this so I only mention in case it helps the developers.",

I prefer the digital read out because its easier to read..would be great if the the analog theme also had a small digital read out at the top (so to not interfere with the cards, and moto 360 flat tire.)...  A must have for future releases is the ability to use on white faced designs in the day and black at night. Its just too hard to see the black in direct sunlight.  Cheers!",

And after installation, battery went from having 25hrs to 19hrs available.",

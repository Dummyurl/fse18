I am making this plea to the developers - PLEASE REPUBLISH v2.4 AS A DIFFERENT VERSION IN THE PLAY STORE SO THAT THOSE OF US WHO NEED A FUNCTIONING APP CAN GET ON WITH EVERYTHING ELSE WE HAVE TO DO. Whilst the newest version doesn't seem to be crashing as much, WHERE HAVE SAVED TRADES GONE?? Seriously guys, this is ridiculous for a company that does so well in every other way. Once again I'll be relying on sideloading a backup of the old app and trying to avoid it updating. I'm an optimistic person so maybe we'll see a result in 2018...",

Because there is a big difference between the rates of sending banks and those of the receiving banks. When you send $s to some European country, the latter banks exchange the $s at much better rates than the US banks. But World First only saves you same money compared to the US banks, but make you a loser against the European exchange rates.",

I have converted 5,000 USD to KES and sent to my wife. They have a option to buy money from every country on main website and after you buy it saves your order and notifies you when the exchange rate is the best. This means you can buy at good exchange rates and just keep switching currency on their website make money each time by buying low",

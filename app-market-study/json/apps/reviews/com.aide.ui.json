If I hadn't been able to do the majority my programming while on the go, there's no way I would have made it through college. There's no question that without AIDE, I would not be the programmer I am today. In fact, I probably would not have been able to pursue programming at all.   Thank you AIDE developers!!",

Now you can't even save a file without having to pay. And the popup saying that you should buy the premium version comes up every few seconds. Also the support for this app got much worse over time. In 2014 there were updates nearly every week. Now this app only receives an update every few months. Please stop squeezing this app for money!",

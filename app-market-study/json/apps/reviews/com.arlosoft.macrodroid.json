However I have a problem in my device (Xiaomi Mi Note 3)  as it is unable to activate or deactivate mobile (cellular) data and battery saver even though I did ADB hack as explained on macrodroid forum. Mobile data toggle changes how it looks but data isn't disabled or enabled and battery saver doesn't even change the toggle. I would like to use this app very much as I think it's great, but I still haven't started to use it properly because of these problems.",

I am very very very very *INF happy that you added the features!!!!!! I wish you the best of luck and hope your carreer may be successful in devolping code!!!!! You macrodroid team are a genius!!!!!!  (Old message (you wont need to read this but anyways): Please add a way to see the x y positions of floating buttons using a variable It would also be good if you could use actions to control where a floating button is And please add actions that can change a floating button's image Also it would be a good idea to add actions where you can do something once the user touches on the floating button and one that does something when the user stops touching the floating button)",

Even i gave this app the autostart permission from my device settings, the app doesn't work. It autostarts normally as any other app but the macros doesn't function(even if the app and macros are enabled). I have to again open the app to make the gestures work. Please do something to fix this issue as fast as possible and then i would give 5 stars\ud83d\ude09",

Most useful app I've found in ages, with a bit of imagination I've achieved many personal macros, personal to me can't see anyone else wanting em. Example I want to cut back on smoking I made a macro to help me. Currently I see no limits to what I can achieve with this and its so much easier than tasker et al AND it can use taker plugins BRILLIANT",

I use it to automate sending texts when beginning my commute to work and upon arriving, setting do not disturb when I arrive at work, disabling mobile data when connected to WiFi, etc.  Love it! Keep it up Arlosoft :)",

        "comment": "Congratulations to the developer. This is a very helpful application. One has to get to understand the concept first. This is easily achieved by reading the help file, trial and error, and/or looking at the available templates. Once you have written your first macro, you just can't stop. The free version is restricted to five macros. Purchasing the app at a reasonable price (my opinion) unlocks unlimited macros. It is money well spent. I've bought junk apps for considerably more. So, go for this one, and enjoy your Android phone on a whole different level. There are other apps out there that claims to be able to do what this app can do. However, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You decide for yourself. My mind is made up.",

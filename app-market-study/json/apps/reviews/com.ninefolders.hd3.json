When I try to sync it forcefully, close full application remove from memory, it still does not come back. The emails are showing on my outlook at work but doesn't show in here. Is this known? It's not frequent, but it happens. Is there a solution in this case?",

At one point, it had been the best, but this is vastly superior to Type mail, and every other email app I've tried. The UI is snappy and responsive; options are clear and easy to find; auto-discovery worked for ALL FIVE of my accounts (this left me speechless); and my activesync accounts work as expected. The app has an overall level of polish that is disappointingly rare on Android. Bravo!",

This is beautiful yet powerful and does a wonderful job letting you see emails in a clear conversational view thread. Have you ever seen the total disorganized mess that Yahoo and so many others do once an email thread has 5 or 6 dialogues in it?? Its almost impossible to even find the last contribution. Just awful. With Nine you will NOT have this problem. In conversation view, emails are succinctly presented in a clear layout almost like text bubbles. Support is great too. Everyone else just give up already.

        "comment": "I have been using Nine for 5 days now and so far I absolutely LOVE it. It is well thought out and is the first email client that can accommodate my wide variety of email platforms including Microsoft OWA. The rich text capability is wonderful - both for emails and signatures. While these are definitely not showstoppers for me, there are just a couple enhancements I'd love to see: 1) The ability to add folders when filing an email. It is a bit cumbersome to leave the filing dialogue, go to settings, add your folder, then reinitiate the filing of the email you want to store in the new folder. 2) The ability to see total number of items in the currently selected folder (not just unread items). 3) The ability to open a folder and at that time, have the option to sync it (rather than having to go to settings to select the synced folders).  Outside of these enhancements, I am really loving my new found ability to see all four of my email accounts in one client!",

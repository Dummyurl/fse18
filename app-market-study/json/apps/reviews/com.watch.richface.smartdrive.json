I have to use the notification tray on my watch. Also it takes a bit to figure out how to actually make the app function. You have to keep re syncing your apps over and over before it actually sends the settings to your watch. Other than that, great app.",

Also you can't see the time when music player is on the screen.  On the time screen when you get a notification or use wear play music player the notification bar covers bottom half of the screen and also you cannot see the time (minutes). Terrible, I would NOT RECOMMEND buying this app!! I suggest you put date on the bottom of the screen, so when you get a notification you can see the time.",

If I need to contact customer service for initial setup it's not working right to begin with.  -Response to dev:   What does work?  The time, the battery state for each device. What doesn't work?  24hr setting, google fit info - I've NEVER seen the screenshot in the ad, weather - I've NEVER seen the screenshot in the ad, I've not discovered how to change watch face color, tapping the screen does nothing most of the time. The icon to get to the other items is size of the head of a pin but hour and minutes sweep dials on each side take up a quarter of the screen - because seeing the huge numbers in the middle isn't enough. I really thought this would be more configurable and actually work.",

I purchased the premium version and installed this watchface on my LG Urbane with brightness set to 2 out of 6, and Screen Time (the time before Ambient Mode Displays) set to 5 seconds!!  That was less than 30 hours ago. Today,  I set it as  my default watchface for first time of use  and i wore it a full 8 hours at work (sitting at a desk job)!  My Watch battery is now at 33% (usually has over 56% left after a 9 hr workday) and on closer inspection, the 4 center digital CLOCK numbers are NOE burned into my screen !!!!! So there is now a center square made up of 4 large dark ovals!!!  I'm am not at all happy!!!!  No other face installed ever burned into screen no matter how long I wore my watch for..which often was a lot longer and much more active!! My beautiful screen is ruined!!!! Be WARNED!! Unlike other faces, the center CLOCK digital numbers do NOT  move and DON'T  DIM. Just gets super bright in ambient mode!!  causing the  BURN IN!!! FIX: Add option to lower brightness in ambient mode!!",

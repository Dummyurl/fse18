Deducted a star as despite paying for premium i still get pop up ads.. no one likes ads especially those of the pop up variety. Ad's are acceptable on free apps but not on paid products",

I then have to restart watch & phone to reestablish the connection for a transfer of 1 or 2 faces. Yes, that's a fix, but a very annoying & time consuming one.

Theses are not showing up in my gallery,  only in the file so I cant use them when building a watch face and I dont have the option to go into the internal memory on the app any more to retrieve them from the beautiful watch folder.",

With the latest update, almost every watchface shown on the app homepage costs at least $.99. What was once a playground full of watches I could use is now a giant advertisement. This has reduced new watchface discovery to almost nothing. There was always a section devoted to selling bundles up top, but that was it. This is no more and I am no longer using this app.",

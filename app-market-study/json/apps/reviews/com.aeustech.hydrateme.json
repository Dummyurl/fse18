I like the 5 minute snooze if I'm not able to drink water I can snooze it and attempt to get it done within 5 minutes and no fear of forgetting. Very easy to adjust to fit you.

If I am target I still get the alarms which is annoying. I would like to set when I should drink and if I input that I drank water then I should not get the alarm. Keep updating please it is a beautiful and clean design.",

I was trying at night to set the alarm for next day between 8am and 7pm and i couldn't. You are able to set the alarm on only during the specified time frame otherwise it won't turn on. Please fix it. I gave 3 stars as I have just turned it on and not received an alarm yet. I will soon change it up or down. EDIT i change rating to 1 star. App drains battery too fast plus it does not notify everytime it was supposed to. I uninstall it. Better use recursive alarm.",

But at least specify whether it's 8cups, 8 8oz glasses, 8 liters, 8 gallons.  Just saying s inking more than 8 can be dangerous is silly if you have not specified exactly what 8 is.  I set mine for twelve (8oz glasses) and I get a warning, which again, is silly because I'm 6'1 and 232lbs.  Lose the warning or be specific. Also, it should keep the previous setting of 12.",

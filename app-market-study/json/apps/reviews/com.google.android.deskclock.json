How about adding a feature where alarms can be grouped? So you have alarms for work that are all turned off or on by a master button. {{Is it me or the alarm fill screen alert has shifted up quite a bit?}}",

Other than those 2 issues I really like it.",

What I meant to write is this app only allows one (1) downloadable alarm sound tone.  The user can select multiple alarm sound tones from the in app provided list.  Unfortunately, if you prefer to download your own alarm sound tones you are limited to just one. Why?  Since my last review an update moved the alarm names to the right side of the days of the week.  Although this is more aesthetically pleasing it still does not address the fact that both the week days and alarm name sometimes fight for space on the same line which can  hide part of the alarm name.",

Used MoveUp timer but really like the full screen feature of the stock Clock app. Unfortunately the sync between phone app and watch app is quite poor. Although the timers set up in phone trigger a notification on watch once finished (and phone app allows to set up multiple timers simultaneously) but there is no way to browse the running timers from the watch. Also, if the timer is set from the watch, it does not get synced to the phone app.  EDIT: alarms stopped triggering all together. Happens quite randomly.",

        "comment": "I really don't trust that this app will wake me up in the morning... since I updated it, the snooze function no longer works. Worked fine for a long time, now it's just a useless app on my phone waiting to be uninstalled. Timer and stopwatch functions give out no sound when activated. Very frustrating. If only 0 stars were an option.",

I was supposed to wake up at 8am this morning for a meeting and it never rang. I even checked afterwards I it was set properly and it was. It just didn't ring. This happens very often. FIX IT.",

The first time the alarm goes off you have to open the phone and swipe left to snooze. If you swipe right (because you aren't awake enough to figure out or remember which is right) then alarm is off and you can sleep for a few extra hours. Your boss might not like that.",

        "comment": "I think this is a very nice app. Sadly 90% of what's offered , you have to purchase. I tried multiple \"free\" meditations only to come back for day 2 and discover they were now locked and I was redirected to a page that said I now had to pay for it, even though the day before it was free. The fee for the subscription content offered is too high. After listening to the multiple meditations I was actually able to listen to (for a day) they all began to sound the same. Excellent idea for an app but needs more variety.",

Now you can barely use any features without an extremely expensive subscription. They have about 3/25 of the programs available for free so it just isn't worth using anymore. Otherwise a nice interface, easy to follow system and nice guided sessions",

And it has made a difference in my life normally I use it first thing to start my day but sometimes if I need time out it's what I use. My stress levels are very low now... Thank you for the app   One of the best I have tried cannot decided on the yearly subscription would prefer a one-off payment. I did it yearly subscription unlocks so much more. Life is a lot better for mediation and this app is brilliant at getting me to that every day.",

The daily meditations are really useful and calming, giving practical advice and guideance for a calmer more mindful existance for todays busy lives. The  sleep stories are brilliant for someone like me that has trouble sleeping and frequently Im fast asleep before its finished.   I never knew this app when a lot of the content was free.  However I believe this app helps to relax me and has a positive impact on my life and wellbeing. The cost I feel is value for money for everything that you get and believe my wellbeing is worth it.",

I can did pay for it once but can't get it to work now.  I'm starting to look around for other free apps like this. It helps the kids fall asleep , which helps me get sleep.

It was really helpful and helped me calm down for the day and I was looking forward to taking the next session.

If you have the money to pay for the contents of the app this should be perfect for you! But if not you might want to look for another meditation app that has more free courses.",

I wasn't sure about using an APP to start meditating, as i was already practicing for some Year, but it provides some very good programs. Besides this also includes calm music for different purposes. Also includes sessions talking about meditation and other topics related ehich are also fine. If i may suggest something.it would be to have available Meditation 8 week program of the book from Mark Williams and Danny Penman. I'm considering to pay for a year of unlocked features as i would like to use more often in my daily practice. Well done.",

Leaving the screen on, turning off do not disturb and using headphones but it still works inconsistently. Please fix this!",

        "comment": "One of the best apps I've ever had. It's a gem that just keeps getting better the more I use it.   I saw an advertisement for this app on Instagram a while ago. I was amazed when I downloaded it, simply by all the ambient sounds that I could listen too. Until today that was all I used it for. Then, for my New Years resolution (less time on social media), I finally uninstalled Facebook from my phone and have replaced my mindless morning scrolling with the Meditations that are offered. Session one is done, and I can't wait to see what else this app brings.",

And I'm so overwhelmed with the welcome message when you open the app \"take a deep breath\". I am taken away immediately when I read that. Really love the app. But I still find it expensive.",

It opens up to a beautiful view of water with running water and bird noises in the background. There are different meditations to different things and each one is short so you don't have to spend forever getting 'in the zone.' I definitely am more aware of myself now and look forward to doing more.",

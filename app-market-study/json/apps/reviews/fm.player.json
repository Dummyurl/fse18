It likes to cut out chunks of sometimes up to a hundred episodes of a podcast at a time, right out of the middle, and keep them unavailable for weeks. No amount of restarting ir wifi fiddling has fixed this. They just come and go. I'm afraid I must try new apps, because I simply cannot listen to my podcasts here.",

I can use any other player for 30+ hours and they don't turn my phone into a hand warmer.  It appears they are aware of issues. I hope they are resolved soon. Just don't fall asleep without terminating the app manually, it's otherwise a good app. System warns of battery drain caused by player FM generally when the app is not playing sound and is closed but still running in background (often when sleep after episode is used)  Tried to send logs, but I'm unsure if they went through.",

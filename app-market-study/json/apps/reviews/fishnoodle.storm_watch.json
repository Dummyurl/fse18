If you like your mobile devices sharing a common theme, or you just want something that looks particularly flash, the Thunderstorm Watch Face should be one of the very first watch-faces you look at!",

        "comment": "So ive been using this watch face since the day i got my watch but now switched on to something else.  Why? Well because its boring. Very very little things to change watch faces   needs a major update with different faces and better working battery level indicator. Its all great but not able to change things up.  Least when i have it on my phone its just ment to be a background show of lights to improve on just regular still pictures.   But watch. The watch face is the star.These are like indie movie stars",

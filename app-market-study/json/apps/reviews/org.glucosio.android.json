It doesn't do calorie/carb counting like a few of the other apps, but that's actually a big plus for me, since I use other apps to do that, and prefer an uncluttered interface for simple tracking.",

        "comment": "I'm new to diabetes.  I'm new to the App,  I've had it about 4 days now.  Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong or is it the App?  I wish I could give this 5 stars.  I like everything about it but this problem below.  I use the weight data entry option.  Pretty simple, settings are on pounds and indicate pounds in the results.  But no matter what I enter it saves the numbers right in History but displays the graph results wrong by hundreds of pounds.     The entry cell for weight entries always reads exactly what I enter, then I save it the same way I do my glucose reading.  The Graph and History are not even close to what I entered.  My weight on the graph  goes from the 300's to the 100's one day after the next randomly.  That would imply I lost 200 pounds overnight.  I go into History and look at the entry and even edit it despite it being the number I originally entered.  When I edit it and save it, the saved number is +/- 5-7 pounds.  Then when I look at the graph it shows me in the 100 pound range.  I'm in the mid 200's.  Point is, none of the numbers match the entry.  Edited numbers always save wrong.  Does someone have a similar experience and or solution?",

Others just didn't think of all the requirements but this developer has really listened to every single 'tip'. He must have been in a great 'frame' of mind when writing it.",

However a more convenient way to pause the clock would be better. Maybe touch and holding with haptic feedback so the umpire does not have to look away from table. Well done.",

It was still a personal experience with the restaurant you were ordering from even with the middle man. Now its just a bunch of rude third party delivery drivers who dont deserve even the 10% tip. How infuriating is it to call the restaurant about a driver they have no control over..",

        "comment": "On multiple occasions, despite recirving confirmation emails that my order had been placed and my credit card had been charged the restaraunts never received an order. Aside from the numerous hours spent waiting on food that wasn't coming I had to then worry if my card had been charged for food I never received. When I try to contact support I get no answer. Service offered is not provided and support is non-existent. Do not use this app or you will waste time, patience, and potentially your money.",

No one responded when I opened chat. Left several messages asking if confirmed or cancelled. Restaurant said it never received my order. Why have I been charged. Total waste of time. I would give them a zero if I could.",

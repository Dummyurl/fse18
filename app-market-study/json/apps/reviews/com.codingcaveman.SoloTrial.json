Sorry but that's a kick in the teeth for those who purchased the original. Update - developer responded but not in a consumer centric manner. Won't be using the app that I previously purchased. Clearly there's not even an incentive to upgrade.",

Now it's $3 too. I asked dev for access to it again and was given sob story about taking money from his kids mouth and I should just buy it again.  Save your time and your money.

There is still no easy way to load a chord/lyrics set, one has to use the unreadable overlay. The audio engine that sort of works has a noticeable delay between touching the string and the sound, and it sadly does not and likely will not support Pebble. So, while there are some improvements over 1, it is not exactly a wow product for me.",

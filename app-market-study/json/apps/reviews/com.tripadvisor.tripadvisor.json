With all the fantastic reviews and photos from other travelers like me, TA makes it a breeze to find the perfect hotel, restaurant, or local attraction. I honestly don't know where I would be without this app. Also, writing my own reviews is a fun and enjoyable way of helping to share my own experiences in the world. 5 stars!!!",

Doesn't remember your credentials so you need to put in your email address and password every single time. You cannot update a listing due to some glitch that will let you delete text but won't let you type.  On top of this, TripAdvisor as a concept is a joke. Watch a documentary about a guy who became number 1 restaurant in the whole of London even though he didn't even have a restaurant and not one single customer set foot in his business.

Keep is good up to a point then it just takes too long to jump to a note quickly. 1st  review: This is a cracking good Note app and I use it on all my devices. I would ask for only two things to be added - Folders to contain my different  subjects and a start page with an alphabetical index of folders so that I can jump directly to my required folder and thence to my note.",

Actually, I'm falling in love with Google keep. It's easy to use. It has plenty of customized and productive features.  I don't know why I'm facing some lag like scrolling, late response etc. But, To be honest, I haven't face that kind of lagging in OneNote.  Please, fix it. At last, I wish it could have unlimited entry capability like OneNote.  Thank you.",

I really like to have a desktop interface for entering data massively and quick, while having an up to date counterpart. I also like to have a simple design. The search behaviour is also well done. I do hope the app keeps improving while retaining simplicity.",

        "comment": "When a reminder goes off  it alters the position of the note in the list from where I carefully had it... it gets moved  to the top so I have to move it back to where I want it.  I STILL get duplicate notifications - usually if one has fired and I go into the app subsequently it then fires again and there are 2.  Also, can the default reminder time be 8am tomorrow consistently. Sometimes it is, other times it isn't dependent on what the time is when you set it. Poor handling of 2 devices - deferring a notification on 1 doesn't on the other - and when you do dismiss it on the 2nd it cancels the deferred time set on the 1st. Of all google apps, this is the buggies and is getting worse",

Many times when I sync an album to the watch it will load and say \"sync successful\" and the album will show up on the watch with no photos in it. I try deleting and syncing again -- doesn't work. I have to delete the app on my phone and watch and reinstall to fix, doing this every time makes the app finicky but still very useful in class :)",

You can do this trick for a fresh sync on the watch. Also, make sure that you are using the latest Google Play Services version. In case you need any help, just send us an email.",

So many other similar apps I paid for and this is free and by far the best period. BTW I do not work for these people and rarely if ever write a review unless they're in the gutter or they're very best.",

This happens on both the S7 and the M8.  ++++++I've been using this app for a while, both on my S7 and now on my M8 that i'm using as a media streamer. On the M8, every now and again songs will skitter and skip. The M8 is wired to my network and my media server has tons of fire power and fast drives (7200+). I have gapless playback turned off and the cache is set to 2000 on an external SD card. Would be nice if this can get resolved.+++++",

This process of corruption has been getting worse with each subsequent release of the server. What does this have to do with this app?  Without the server this app is 100% pointless.  Support is also absent.  You can visit the forums but don't expect answers even to common questions such as repeated and predictable database corruption.  There is no solution to the issue and the suggestions only work till the database corrupts again.  Do not use.  Do not buy this app until the author fully addresses the corruption issues.",

On the other hand,  it doesn't drain any faster while in use,  so you just need to remember to force stop the app.                       ....

A recent bug I have discovered relates to Chromecast usage and switching back to normal (local/online) use.  After stopping Chromecasting, the app will sometimes give a \"failed to load\" error when playing content normally until I force stop the app.  I have duplicated this issue on 3 different devices (Nexus5, S7, OnePlus3T).  Keep up the great work!  Edit: disabling DLNA resolved the issue.  May want to disable by default.  Thanks again!",

When you look at a photo, it Should be one of the first words to come to mind, or at least the 5th, but some of these pictures are just so freaking terrible. Just play it. You'll hate this game because how the hell are shirt sleeves representative of clothes? You have to play to understand. This is the worst game that I cannot stop playing. I have to look up half the answers because the picture is a monopoly board and the word is \"house\"... like what the heck guys?!",

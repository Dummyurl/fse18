I love the gesture-based control, making it easier to control my Podcast Addict app.   I've only just had this app for a few minutes, so I'm withholding the final star for a bit, since there's some delay between fast forward and rewind.

The only downside is I have to use the voice commands: \u201cOk Google\u201c, \u201cStart music boss\u201c. Yet it would be cooler if it could take over the \"Play music\" command and go right away.

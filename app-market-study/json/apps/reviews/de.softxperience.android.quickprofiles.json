But this app is really at par with Nokia profiles. You can create new profiles & customise as in Nokia, even better. Really handy when you need to set volume levels at once. A big thanks to developer.",

When you change the profiles that show up as shortcuts on homescreen, they don't change till you swipe the screen ... this wasn't the case before three updates. One tap on the profile and it would change asap, not now  2. The names change to stock name: 'Quick Profiles' and discard the ones that have been given. Pl fix this.",

I purchased PRO thinking that would change it, and I still have the older interface. I have no idea why",

        "comment": "Runs Great on my HTC One-X Quad Core.  Worth the price!  Finally, an APP that instantly turns off my Ringer Volume AND the Alarm Volume after creating a Profile I called MEETING.  So many APPs turn off or down the Ringer Volume but fail to control the Alarm Volume and I hate it when an Alarm Goes off during an office meeting.  To mitigate instances where I may forget to re-activate the NORMAL Profile I created (ringer and Alarm returned to 100 percent), and inadvertently have my morning alarm volume disabled, I use Timeriffic to automatically turn my Ringer and Alarm volume to 100 percent at 2000hrs daily.  Being able to create Profiles for Home (volume and alarm 100 percent, blue tooth off, wi-fi on, screen brightness 15%), Car (volume and alarm 100 percent, blue tooth on, wi-fi off. screen brightness 100%) is great!  I recommend upgrading to the Pro Version, you get a set of icons to display when selecting a profile, and the selected profile's Icon appears on the home screen, making it easy to verify which Profile is active.

But worst thing switching off from app - like on old Windows XP - Are you sure that you want to switch off TV?, you will lost connection. Every time you should confirm the same, yes, yes, yes I'm sure.... Developers-designers added more clicks, swipes, they don't like straight easy ways, hate app now!",

Only option is to open the app, navigate to select media to share and send to TV (takes longer and it's so many more taps to get to) please bring back the option to share content via the share menu on S8+ devices.",

Because when it comes to smartness, believe me it's a hoax. My Smart TV is not even capable of remembering wifi password. The moment I switch it on, it requires me to re-authenticate by entering all the passwords again. Plus I bought my TV in Feb 2018 from authorized showroom and they sell me 2017 model with assurance that I'll receive upcoming update, but now LG declares that it'll be updating only 2018 models with WebOS 4.0. Now one can imagine how much cheated I'm feeling right now. I spent around 50000 bucks on my new TV. All I want to suggest is to go with a dumb TV and make it smart via Chromecast or Picast and yes, don't go with LG Products.",

I have my dad & son's appts along with my own, work and personal things to manage and often times I need to look back on days. On this alone, I'll have to delete. Love the concept and it did help me in many ways, visually organized my days but I need more: it: link to emails if I'm prepping for meeting and need to refer to it.",

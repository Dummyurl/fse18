It seems if I'm in a low signal areas it take even longer. Would be good if i could create shortcuts to open a reward card directly and have it happen in a timely manner.",

Photos are *WAY* off center from the viewfinder mask and there's no way to crop or correct - have to guess and compensate manually, takes many tries. Apparently very limited barcode standard support - won't scan originals and result looks nothing like original.",

        "comment": "The Rewardle section of this app is great, letting me track how many points I have and where. And I'm also glad it's upgraded to store other rewards cards. However, the interface for this part is not easy to use: when adding a new card the list is huge and can't be searched so requires scrolling through the list, and once added they don't automatically sort (e.g. Alphabetically), can't be searched, and are really big so takes time to shuffle through. Finally, the barcode scanner has a lot of trouble focussing on the card if not flat on a surface, so most of the time I have to enter manually. Otherwise, I like that I can empty my wallet of cards.",

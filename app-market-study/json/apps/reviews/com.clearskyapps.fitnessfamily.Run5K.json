        "comment": "It is a great program. I have a few of the apps they have and they are all great. I do not ise the tracking distance since it does not seem to track correctly, could be due to the constant cloud cover over my area. I also don't use gear so I cannot vouch for that aspect of the apps, though it does say it supports at least a few.  Being a former Marine coming off an injury they have helped me rehab nicely. Used these in the past to get me ready and stay ready for fitness tests. Only complaint is that now each one is pay to use and I can't do a bundle price. Is that something coming in the near future?",

        "comment": "Great watch face. Looks really cool and info is shown well. My only criticism is that the sector view can only be used to show hours or months, both of which are fairly redundant since the same info can be seen by just looking at the time or date. I think a good use for this bar would be to show a timer counting down or to show seconds.  Update: I recently went on a flight and I found a slight issue with this. When the time is updated by the phone. The sector view is updated but the hour stays the same as before it received the update. So after a 2 hour time change my sector view was at 6 bars and the actual time shown was 4 o clock.",

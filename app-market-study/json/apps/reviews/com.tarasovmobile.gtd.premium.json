You need to benchmark Everytask app. It is very old app and not user friendly UX, but it has every thing about gtd.",

When used with the web app I am able to organize anything and everything that comes up.  The only thing I would ask for by the developers is better widgets.  It would be great to have a widget which displays a project like One-step Actions.  As it is right now, I am not able to use the current widgets because they don't have features that I would use very often.",

The beauty of the app is that you can add thoughts and tasks as soon as you think of them, and you know where to find them! No more post its and jotted notes around the office. If I could ask for one addition to the app it would be to be able to see gmail/outlook calendar items within the app itself - this would make choosing due time/dates a lot easier if your week is often full of meetings.",

I've checked in a few times, just to see if maybe something got reworked. FINALLY, it appears that the dev has worked out the kinks, and it works pretty... Pretty... Pretty good. UI could use some tweaking, but who am I to complain?! Well done!",

Alternatively, allowing reordering of devices/buttons (including the voice one) would be a fine answer here.  - Support unlocking doors - I can't think of the occasion I've had my watch and phone without my keys and wanted to /lock/ the door.  Ideally support both, but if you can only do one, let me choose unlock. - Limited use case - single-toggle-mode;  On opening the app, toggle a single thing (like say, my lock) automatically - a la open app, unlock door automatically, done.  All around it's pretty good, but with my home devices always listening anyhow - the thing I want my smartwatch to be able to do is manipulate my smartlock.",

Scrolling through 15 switches if you don't want to use voice is no fun. Still appreciate it and will support the developer to encourage more updates to the app!",

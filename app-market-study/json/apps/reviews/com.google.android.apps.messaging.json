I'll receive duplicate notifications, no notifications, or my phone will vibrate like I'm receiving a message when I send one, with no option to turn that off. Google please fix this or I'll have to get another messaging app.   Great app, needs to have the ability to like/Love a message. Also needs better integration of knowing when someone's typing and to be able to text anyone with the app over WiFi like iMessage. Then it'll be the best around.",

How can you hold the phone one handed and take a picture when the button is in the MIDDLE of the screen (especially in landscape)? Also, can you please add the ability to change backgrounds and balloon styles like the stock app? I have to agree about the RETURN key. Please bring it back.",

That being said, I don't always get all the texts particularly from iPhones and sometimes the text will be half of the next text mixed with part of an older text? It's pretty bizarre. It makes it not particularly reliable when it only works completely some of the time. Fix that issue and it'd be a great messaging app...",

        "comment": "Wish you could change background on the messages. As much time as we spend texting, people like to have the ability customize or give a theme to their messaging app and in order to use some of the features of the Gboard you need to use this app for messages. I don't want to change the colors of every contact. I want the ability to change the colors of all of them as well and the message bubbles and background. I don't think that should be to hard since almost all the other message app allow that.  Adding the ability to personalize this message app would make this the best app. I don't know if I will use it bc of that. I would rather be able to Personalize my message app over using the features of the Gboard that only work with this app. Silly maybe, but when you text all the time but only use a feature once in awhile it makes a difference.",

It chooses at random who it will NOT send a text to.   Ex: Today I CAN'T send to Mike, yesterday I COULD send Mike, and tomorrow it's POSSIBLE  that I can send to Mike?  Between a few different minor things that add up to frustrating, I will Not get another pixel",

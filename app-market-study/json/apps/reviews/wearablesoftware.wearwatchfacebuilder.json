Edit - App seems a bit more stable with the original System DPI. Could still use some more documentation regarding expressions. Seems like there are more possibilities here, than are presented in the actual list of available expressions. Edit, runs flawlessly on custom ROM.  Seems to be a week ahead of my calendar though, could be an issue with the whole week 1 starts on jan.1. or the first monday after jan.1. Turns out this is also dependant on the ROM I am using.",

        "comment": "This does the job as intended but doesn't really offer anything exciting and actually seems less featured than its rival Watchmaker pro,  it lacks shadow effects, tinting linked to time or other numerical value to allow colour changing over time and more. I'm using the free version and really do not see incentive to buy premium other than being able to save more than one watch, but since I don't find it particularly inspiring even on advanced mode, I think I may just go back to Watchmaker pro.",

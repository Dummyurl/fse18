Then I did a Google search and found this app. It's everything and more that I wanted! I absolutely love the Indefinite and Indefinite+ options. I haven't thoroughly tested the watch for battery life with the app (it will obviously not be too great if always on), but it will serve exactly what I need. Well worth the money. Thank you for this brilliant app!",

Sorry that app installation in Android Wear has remained a sometimes complicated procedure for so long! Gladly, all of that will change with the upcoming Wear 2.0 update, which allows to install apps from the Play Store directly to the watch.",

I looked on Google and saw this app. It's a paid app but from good reviews I'd though I'd give it a try. This app worked great no problems  At all. Was worth every penny.  Thanks to the person(s) who ever developed this app. (Phone freaks) It's appreciated.   Ps: works on Huawei watch.  If you have this watch, screen burn in shouldn't be a problem. The programing moves the screen face slightly pixel by pixel.  Thanks",

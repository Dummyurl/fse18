I personally don't use that motivation stuff and so wouldn't mind seeing an option to disable it. EDIT: I had some queries about some things and they have been answered very quickly and usefully. Thanks.  PS. I also find the step counter on Cinch to be more accurate.",

The exercise recorded under calories comes from any other Fit enabled applications (e.g. RunKeeper, Runtastic, or manual entry into the Google Fit app).  Step differences between the apps is due to using different streams of data.  Cinch seems more accurate to me, but let me know if that's not the case for you.  THX!",

Even if I set the tracking to \"never\" green light will still be ' active ' on the watch.  Good to have (optional):  - By default app shows average heart rate per hour. It would be great to have 2nd screen like table with last XX heart rates.  - Need zones for heart rate, so the watch will vibrate if we have to high heart beat on \"workout mode\".   Once it done, 5 stars  app !",

Tapping on the Android Wear app doesn't stop it, Tapping on the app \"check HR\" doesn't stop it.   Please let me know, other than that great job!",

It gets reported out each hour so I'm guessing Cinch takes an hourly average.  This is perfect because I image my Moto 360 only has a 25-50% success rate in terms of measuring my pulse.  Thus, the hourly average looks like it smooths that our.  I'll probably pay the $1.99 or whatever it costs to keep this permanently.  One of my favorite Android Wear apps.",

No Point in being able to set the order only to have it immediately change. Have ended up looking for wrong buses before now and arrived late. Annoying!",

        "comment": "In principle, I like this app. However some improvements are needed! (#1) - All bus timetables are not available. This is hit and miss, depending on the route e.g. H25 bus timetable, not available! (#2) - Adding a bus to the widget needs to be clearer! Every time I have a need to add a new bus, I have to search the entire app to work out how to do it again. Please use a '+' symbol instead of the 3 dot crumbs icon, it would be clearer. Also, perhaps add something to the tab where my routes are stored to make it easier to add from that tab. (#3) - I have and use 3 phones. I'd like for my experience of the app to be account based, so that logging in, pulls down my settings and stored buses from the cloud. Save me having to make changes on each phone. My updates should sync across all devices seamlessly. (#4) - The app sometimes crashes when searching for a bus or road name that is valid. Please fix this. Thanks for these long overdue updates. 5 starts coming when updated \ud83d\udc4d apart from these fixes, great app!!!",

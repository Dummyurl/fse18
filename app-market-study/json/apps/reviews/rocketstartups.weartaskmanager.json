It's also not clear what the app is doing to my watche but it has definitely boosted battery life and has sped up the whole wear 2.0 experience on my ticwatch s. In that respect, how can I complain? I definitely recommend the app.",

Only issue I have is I have TouchOSC sideloaded on a Moto 360 and when I kill it and try to reopen it it still takes me to the same screen, and without a back button I get stuck on that screen. I can still quit it and use the watch as normal but I have to restart the watch to get back to TouchOSC's main menu, where I was hoping this app would properly exit it so I could relaunch and be back at the main menu. Other than that it works great.",

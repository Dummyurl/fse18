Can see the app on my phone, but not in Android Wear, the settings don't stay set in the app, and it doesnt ever shiw up not on the watch. Restarted both, resynced the apps, nothing.  Guess that's why there's a refund button.  Read some of the previous responses and got it resolved. Very nice watch face.  You might want to fix that installation process though.",

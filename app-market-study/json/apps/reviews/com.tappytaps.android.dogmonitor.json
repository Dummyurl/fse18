The dog station keeps disconnecting after one min and can't then reconnect without someone clicking on dog station again. Unfortunately my dogs do not know how to useca smart device. Our Internet speed is fantastic. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.",

Having a list of her noisy and quiet times are really useful. It's an amazing alternative to the expensive monitoring devices out there. The only feature I wish it had would be a 2 way camera so she could see me too.   The downside, I had to purchase the app from both Google Play and the App Store. My phone is an Android, and I don't have another Android device so I had to use my Mac. And an FYI, this won't work in BlueStacks on Windows because of the cam and mic functionality, and has issues with other Android emulators as well.",

Works great between Android to iOS as well. Please please please add wide angle support for LG phones and others that support it. It would make it so much better on video to see the entire room at once with a wide angle camera. A Windows/web client would also he valueable but I cant complain with the platform support as it stands. A dedicated video button would also be nice since running a VPN or Adblocker seems to stop the ability to view video. Ideally a voice button, photo button, and video button rather than let the app decide. Thanks.",

I do find the microphone a little sensitive but if you use the video feed you can see what's really going on and the image is fairly clear (and really clear on WiFi). We do not speak to our dog through  it as this would just upset him but it is great for checking in to make sure he is ok. It's a bit of a battery drain at the dog station end but then this may also be because I am using an old mobile for that end.  However, it is very unreliable and frequently loses connection, even if you are inside the house on the same WiFi connection for both stations. Earlier I had a great video feed of my dog, I decided to stop the feed to save battery, now it cannot find the dog station. When it does find the station, it tells me it cannot connect to it. This is very frustrating and makes me feel anxious that  I cannot check my dog as often as I would like to. For a \u00a35 app, I expected better reliability.",

This app is draining my battery because is uses GPS location constantly without any option to control it. At the moment the app has been using GPS for 2 hours and 40 minutes and I have only taken it off the charger 3 hours ago... it's using more battery than my screen! Please fix this and add an option to pay for a pro version.",

        "comment": "This app is amazing. First of all even though this app takes a comedic turn on the weather, it is still more accurate then the weather channels themselves, go figure. Second, the app itself is just hilarious, giving an amazing amount of humor on a day where the weather might have you down. This app easily dwarfs other apps that tell the weather not only with it's comedic theme, but also with it's accurate weather forecasts. Another small, but funny detail I would like to talk about is what the app said when it asked me to rate it. The app gave me three options, the third not being important, the other two options are very funny. The option I could choose for giving the app a rating was \"fantastic, I love this app\" or something like that, the first option only becomes funny when you read the second. The second option which you could choose if you didn't want to rate the app was \"frankly, that's a piece of ****\" which was so funny and made my day with how they customized the choices of whether you wanted to rate something or not. Five Stars!",

I think it may be from a developer not fluent in English, because some of its grammar and/or wording is off. Plus, in the timeline graph of predicted temperatures, the labels are celcius when truly the graph is a representation  of fahrenheit. (The graph shows 50\u00b0C and declining. 50\u00b0C is about 120\u00b0F...the true temperature now is about 50\u00b0F) A little more variety in descriptions could be good too...  Submissions of descriptions could expand the app and make it more user interactive.",

The AI language needs a little more variance as well, after a few days of the same weather it repeats itself and the whole app losses at least some of it's charm and appeal at that point.",

        "comment": "Live in FL and my app says no clouds and no rain? It's severely cloudy and grey and raining right now..I wish I could send a picture.. even the radar has the green and orange rain on it. But 3 stars cause it is pretty hilarious and I do like it enough I'm keeping it. With FL weather you pretty much have to look at/on 3 different weather channels or apps to get an average on what the day is going to be like anyways.",

        "comment": "Works great for knitting. Perfect, actually. I would prefer if the + was bigger and more centered on the screen, but it really doesn't matter because even having the ability to keep track of my rows while knitting from my watch (instead of from my phone) is extremely convenient. On my phone I'd constantly get sidetracked by other applications, get locked out and stuck entering my lock code every time I wanted to just add a row. What makes it better is that I can then save the tally \u2764\u2764",

        "comment": "[Update: Abandonware. Replaced by \"Magic Watch Face.\"] I love the design aesthetics of this watchface. And it has just enough customizations to make it feel personalized. Importantly, on my Gear Live, battery life is exemplary with this watchface. Unfortunately, the transition animation between active and ambient screens doesn't always finish, so about 20% of the time, the ambient screen displays the wrong time. So as a watch, this watchface fails.",

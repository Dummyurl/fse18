        "comment": "So I was reading the help site and it mentioned a WiFi trigger. I didn't see it in the app but thought paying for the Unlock Features would enable it. Not only did the IAP not enable that feature, it didn't seem to enable anything. I tried asking for a refund but never got a response.  The Profiles are also a little clunky. I wish they had the option of only setting specific categories. I never really want my Media volume set to something specific. I just want it what I have it set to last.   I do like that it allows me to separate my Ringer and Notification volumes on my Pixel XL without root.",

        "comment": "I purchased this app to separate the notification and ringer volumes. Free version doesn't have this. Paid the $3.99 and it didn't appear to have added this feature. After hacking through the options, it seems that it may have added it.  Very confusing layout and not sure how to set it up.  I would choose another app for addressing something as important as ensuring that you don't miss phone calls. ... After further use I figured out how it works.  My I comments were due to Operator Error (me).  It's a pretty good app.  A few small enhancements, however,I would it much easier to configure and view current settings.",

Even though the app widget tells me there should be volume, when I go into my settings the ring is on silent. Will have to uninstall until this is fixed. App is great otherwise.",

It used to be easy to see which profile was enabled, now I can't see it at all. Also, when swithching profiles it now changes the ringtone on the first SIM to default. Yes, I know I can specify the right ringtone in each profile, but this is a very poor solution, because every time I decide to change the ringtone I will have to remember to change Volume Butler settings. This didn't use to be an issue. One way to fix it would be to use a setting that does not affect the choice of a ringtone in any way.",

But after the last update and went from a five-star app to a one or two star app. The last update took away route alternatives. and now the ability to pan around the map and find an alternative manually isnt really an option either since it keeps snapping back to the direction it wants to go instead of letting me move it manually and just recenter  when I'm done. Hoping Google fixes it and I'm sure they will but for now 1 star again",

It like picked a route for you and then it skips the hour and gives you alternate routes in the next hour not for right now you to really have to know what options for public transport are to figure out the best route. It's like the app gets confused.",

Additionally, it never gives me the fastest times. I'll start to follow the route, notice it's too slow myself, take a different route, and the time will drop on Maps. The location sharing also is terrible. It won't update for 19 hours sometimes. No sure what happened with this app but it's awful now.",

How are you going to use this for navigation when you can no longer make a distinction between roads and land? you know dark lines on a map are there for a very good reason? so we have an idea where it ends or begins. you make it all as close to white as possible then no one can tell where they should be turning or ending at.

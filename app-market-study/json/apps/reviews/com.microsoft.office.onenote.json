        "comment": "It's a great note taking app that integrates well with PC. The sync is INSTANT! It lacks auto titling for handwritten only notes, which makes it rather confusing when I don't put any title directly. Perhaps using date, time, and location for any new note is great. For SPen it lacks pressure sensitivity and that's all. I like the two pen color option, it makes everything done quicker. The app should also utilize the always use Rules Lines on new notes like the one on PC. But the most important feature is sorting notes based on date modified. If that can happen soon then it will be perfect.",

Especially, if you have a wide homescreen, you can make good use of its widget function. The only drawback I have realized so far is that there is no way this version and the PC's one can synchronize, and I hope this would be fixed in a near future. Thanks for a wonderful app.",

I can sit and do my work on my phone and then when the computer is free I can print off the same work that I have done! But one thing that I think you should improve is to add more editing details for example a letter size or font of it on the phones please!!! Thank you for the work that you are doing! I really appropriate it!",

        "comment": "It's a great app! I've started using it for professional reasons, as a personal/work diary. It works like a physical notebook when you have different tabs, only here you can have sub-tabs, which is great. I would suggest adding a few more sub-tabs in case one needs to expand their notes, the way a tree branch grows. I love the yellow text highlighting function, very helpful to make your notes stand out, and it's great you can underline, change to writing to bold or italics. I would just maybe also add the ability to change the font size and type. It's great as a personal diary too. You can upload pictures (from your gallery or you can take one there and then) and write underneath them. You can title your tabs, and the date and time is recorded automatically. Great job to the team who developed it. Would also be great to see the changes suggested above maybe. Thanks!",

Not good for typing content though due to issues like being unable to easily copy and paste content using Swype keyboard shortcut gestures and general touch typing responsiveness. If you use Onenote primarily for storing existing content you find on the web, then it'll get the job done so you can finish on desktop. Definitely not a mobile only app though. Would be nice if there was a full screen option as well since the menu bar takes up quite a bit of screen real estate.",

When I'm typing text on a Galaxy Tab S3 and attempt to go back and insert or correct something in a previous sentence, as soon as I begin typing the cursor jumps to another place in the paragraph. Usually it jumps to the beginning of the paragraph, sometimes it's random. Sometimes, as soon as I begin writing the entire paragraph is deleted. Please fix!",

The eraser only erases some unknown area 4 inches to the upper left of the pen cursor, not the one you're pointing at. After a while the cursor constantly jumps to the beginning of a note while writing somewhere else. Ink does not appear right on the S-pen cursor anymore but a tiny little bit to the left of it. Performance has generally become worse, as the app hangs a lot more. The 26 February 2018 update did not resolve any of those issues!",

        "comment": "Update 28/2/18 - There seems to be a bug in the latest versions since early February where handwriting strokes disappear randomly when it syncs to the desktop.  sometimes it loses letters, sometimes parts of letters.  Result is some of my notes end up unintelligible, and I have to work hard to decipher them.  If this continues I'm worried I may lose something serious, not happy with this  Update 9/2/18 - Latest version is really poor.  Drawing on my tablet now shifts slightly as it resolves the drawing, and this takes half a second to do.  So you might start writing a word, and the first few letters shift while you're writing which is very distracting.  Its much slower, and occasionally the drawing stops working on a pen and you need to change pens then switch back again.  For drawing this is a much poorer version than it used to be.    Original review: App works well and is good to use. Nice to be able to handwrite on the screen.",

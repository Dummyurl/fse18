Please don't treat us as though we are too stupid to be able to understand.

I already have problems with the way you calculate the bill and called multiple times with no resolution. Now you've made things even more obscure by hiding the usage information on the app. It's obvious your claims of being \"transparent\" are now untrue",

He said they were getting lots of complaints. 2 months later  powershop still hasn't listened to its customers. Time to move on.  I cannot believe they removed the cost per unit? WTF! How are we meant to know what we are spending. You have removed the thing that most customers used, very silly. I'll be making a phone call about this.",

Also hourly usage chart doesn't work.",

It's deceptive and doesn't allow us consumers to know how much we're spending per unit at the point of sale. I'm switching energy supplier, this is dodgy and not transparent enough.",

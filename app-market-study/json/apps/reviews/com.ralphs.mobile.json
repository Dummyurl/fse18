        "comment": "Apparently Ralphs (Kroger) has decided to ignore the long term users of this app, and continue serving us this mess. This last update addresses none of our (YOUR CUSTOMERS) arguments, and only adds more items I have no use for. After my last 2+ hour ordeal of fighting with this thing I've decided to start using \"Flipp\". I can even use \"Rewards\" cards with it, but here's the kicker... I'm finding things that I buy less expensive at other local stores than your sale prices, and I don't have to use a card. Since I don't buy gas at Shell on a regular basis, I'm not really missing out on \"Rewards\" (except a maybe free \"Cup Noodles\", or something equally unimportant). I'm tired of complaining about how you have ruined a once great app, and having it fall on deaf ears. After 10+ years of shopping almost exclusively at Ralphs, I'll be spreading my money around elsewhere. Show me that you are interested in keeping my business by getting this app back to a user friendly state, and you'll get me back. I don't really WANT to go, but as it stands now, I can't keep wasting my time with this.",

It doesn't even show a 'Free Friday' category and well... it's Friday! Tried to click on the link from the main page that says 'Free Friday' but takes me to a blank coupon page. PLEASE FIX I LOVE THIS APP AND I LOVE KROGER",

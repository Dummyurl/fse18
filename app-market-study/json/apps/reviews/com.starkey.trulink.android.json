There are limitations for Android users on the hearing aids themselves that should be pointed out by the providers when we purchase Starkey hearing aids.  Apple has the market on streaming audio and media on these HAs because they have put the development in and made it proprietary. \ud83d\ude15 As a faithful android user with hearing loss, it really sucks. But the app works and functions properly.  So there is that.",

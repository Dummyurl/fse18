I can always find what I'm looking for and I'm so happy that something like Pinterest exists because every other app that is similar isn't anywhere near as good as this app!!!!! If I could give it a million stars I would!!! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9c",

Not cool, ok. SLOWEST (thanks to f* ads) and annoying. The help center suggestions doesn't match the solution and the issue persist. USED TO love it, NOW I HATE IT. That's not how we liked it.",

And when you attempt to address the issue. Their help center definitely not helping the matter. And appearently Pinterest doesn't get rid of all of the copyright stamped photos that account holders post.",

Particularly when I get messages/shared pins that are nowhere to be found in my inbox, then I have to start a new message to a particular person just so that it opens their message window and I can see what they've sent.

When doing a Google search you get a specific result or a zillion results but they are all about what you searched.

I love to go in and see recipes and what people thought of them. Now you switched it all up. Fix this and I'll give you 5 stars as long as you don't mess up something else in the process. Still my go to app for hair tips, decor ideas, recipes and so much more.",

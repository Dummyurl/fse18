Take Outlook for example. I also hear you can use this to make calls and texts while only connected via the Internet so handy if you don't have cellular signal. Highly recommended.",

It's not a connection problem I would like to have this fixed, but it's no big deal most of the time. Still a really great app!",

        "comment": "Good app.  I use when overseas to have US number local #  I can be reached at. Doesn't cost anyone to call me.  Cost for me to call is cheap, pennies per minute.  This is one of the few VoIP that  do calls, texts, text  pictures, and is fast. AND works over cellular or wifi.    When in a foreign country I get cheap local sim card,  and the text me VoIP works over cellular 3/4g. Most don't.   I purchase my # and keep it as long as need .  If interface and ads were cleaner and totally removeable, id give it 5 stars. It still has offers showing, and isn't real clean.   For some reason, notifications don't always work when receive call or msg.  Also, it doesn't do group messages well at all. It sends out separate messages to each recipient.  On incoming, you can't see who else was on it and respond to them too. It will hang sending to multiple people if photo attached too, only first recipient goes out.      Fix these things and it would be awesome",

When you send a picture, the recipient gets a link to follow to see the picture. This doesn't happen with text now or text free. These people have no clue what they're doing. When I started using this app I started getting a pop up in Google Chrome telling me my phone was infected. Stay away from this text app. My favorites are text free and text now. Both those apps do not put ads in your text messages",

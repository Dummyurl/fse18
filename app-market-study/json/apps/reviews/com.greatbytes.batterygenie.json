        "comment": "Not working reliably enough for my use. What would help is some detailed documentation about how it works. I have a wifi tablet that I want to monitor. It has multiple users and the wifi is switched off overnight. This wouldn't be uncommon. And whilst it does generally work that is possibly because someone will turn on the screen which seems to wake it up. But it shouldn't need the screen to be active - the purpose of the sw is to prevent people picking up the tablet and finding a dead battery. Also I am not receiving Chrome notifications. That could be at my end. But there is no assistance to help find out where to look inside Chrome.  However, it is worth a try to see if it works for your situation. But give it the full month to see if it is reliable. It wasn't for my purposes.  Only 2 stars. Based on the principle that if you pay for an app then it should come with detailed instructions and support.",

Rename with chrome extension does not work, just pops up something and closes it quickly.  When the trial is over, if those two things are not addressed, it's not worth even the $0.99, sorry.  One idea for notification: if the battery drains too fast while my screen is off (like 5% in 30 minutes or whatever, configurable) notify me that something is eating my battery, so I can reboot the device. Will be REALLY useful.",

I just updated the app and it's working beautifully! Love the app with the coupons and fuel points! Please chill out on the clock list promos, there isn't a Kroger that offers it within 50 miles of me so I couldn't care less. Thanks!",

You can make grocery lists and order on Clicklist too. My one complaint is that one of the recent updates has caused the weekly ads to be cut off on the bottom. You can't see the bottom edge of the ad at all.",

        "comment": "I enjoyed the fact that this app kept me focused on my list. It also saved me a lot of time. Pick up was quick fast and easy. However there are quite a few problems with it still. There's not nutritional information for every single product. For many of the products, I can't see how much food there is in a serving. I also cannot see how many servings are in the container of food. Finally, I can't see the nutrition label. For several of the products, this information was blurred making it unreadable. When I first opened the the app, I could see what aisles products were on and now, I can no longer find the aisle  Information because it has disappeared off of my app.  Also, when I called customer service they couldn't find the information either. They also couldn't get the app to show nutrition information on every product. They also couldn't get it to show what aisles products were on for in-store shopping. It's also a real bummer that I get special coupons from Kroger for being a loyal customer, but those paper coupons can't be scanned into this app.",

I like that I can search digital coupons and add them to my account/card. However, I don't like that it's so cumbersome to add the clipped coupon item to my shopping list.  It's way too many clicks...its an extra step to add them to the clicklist and another step to add to the shopping list. I wish if you clipped the coupon it would automatically add to my shopping list.  Then go into the shopping list and decide if I want to use clicklist or just use the list to shop myself.  It's so annoying that it almost makes me not want to shop at Kroger.",

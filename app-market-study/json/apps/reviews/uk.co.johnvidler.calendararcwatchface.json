One question,  my notifications don't stay visible on the watch after it dims...  Is that something with the watch face?  My stock faces didn't act this way. Also agree,  need ability to increase font size and battery meter icons. Thanx",

I'll be adding a toggle for that behaviour in the next release though (with font sizes too), if you prefer to keep them on screen. I did it that way mainly to try and avoid burn-in potential problems on OLED screens.",

For my old eyes,  I'd consider the numbers on the time 'Medium' but the Day of week, day of month etc 'Small'.  The current events view should mostly likely have similar text size options.  Would appreciate a Small, Medium, Large, Maybe Extra large option for text sizes.  .   If given a preference I'd most likely not show the 'Arc' branding.  My watch is the LG G Watch.",

My main grump - I added an \"Exchange\" account type to track work emails and appointments.  This works for the Albumen watch face (which apparently uses the native Google Wear integration).  However, this watch face is unaware of it, and due to its UI, I suspect that it accesses the calendars directly using a different API.",

I'd like more options for the complications, like \"signal strength\" or \"exercise\" or what have you. I'd like a better \"low battery mode\" for my watch-with-no-battery.

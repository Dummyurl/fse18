Very upsetting when motion deteted goes off and you can't  see why. Takes at least a minute to a minute and a half for the movement to show after detection goes off.  Very dissapointed  in sytem",

I can turn the sound on for a camera, call the phone, and I hear it ringing. Video is also there. But the app says the system is offline? I try restarting the OPU (remotely) nothing changes. Of course not, because it's \"offline\". Need an update to fix this. Otherwise love this system on a budget. SERIOUSLY!  FIX the false OFFLINE status! I can't do anything but view video when this bug occurs (which is probably once/week lately)",

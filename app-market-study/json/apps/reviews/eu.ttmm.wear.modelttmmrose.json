This has found a great balance and has found its way to being my main watch face. I would love to be able to choose the color of the outer and inner ring separately though.",

Idea of having nice design is to show it off, don't want blank screen so not using \ud83d\ude29 hope it can get fixed soon, until then 4* for design but can't give 5* until can use it (know it's my choice not to but I want to! \u263a).",

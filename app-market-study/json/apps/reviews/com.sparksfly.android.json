Also find navigation very strange, needs to be more simple/typical. Great idea and still the only app i can find offering these features. Just not executed terribly well at the moment unfortunately :(",

It says its logged on. Everything looks green-go. But nothings there. And yeah, the navigation a little weird--no way to get back up the tree sometimes. Also can we expect other social media apps in the near future? g+? WordPress?  Edit: No, don't get any updates but twitter now. I wanted to like it too. So pretty.   But its dead, Jim.",

If I still have to open the fb app, what's the point of this one?",

I mean it's a great idea but really only 4 connections ....why did you even bother? You should not have launched this app until you had at least a 10. And on top of that, why would I sign into this app to see Facebook and then I only see my own stuff instead of the stuff that's been posted on my timeline by friends and family?  Totally not whats its made out to be in the descrip.",

Now facebook has limited ALL 3rd party apps from seeing your contacts. BTW if you connect more than one feed (facebook) you start to see the real benefits of Sparksfly. We working hard to add more networks Sparksfly everyday.",

(2) I do not see all the people from my social networks (in order to make routines) (3) I create a routine and they tell me there is no content when ik there should be. There is far too much drama in just the start up of this app..I'm so disappointed because I was really excited, I thought this app would've been great :(",

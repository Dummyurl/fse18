Please make it where gmail mobile allows you to create new folders or delete some for organizing emails without having to use a browser.  Also, please allow a sharing of emails especially in regard to newsletters so they can be shared to apps like G+ etc. from Gmail. I don't have sync problems with other email services like I have with Gmail. Chronically. Google Photos is wonderful, other Google groups are good, so please do something about Gmail and G+.

Fantom unread emails, it shows that there is unread messages but there are none available. Shows emails previously deleted. It has gotten worse since last update. Will not delete email from yahoo account,  they just reappear like magic,  but its not funny. I really don't know why people complain because Google will not listen because they are too big to really care what their costomers want they know much better than we do. Most recently cannot add new or existing Yahoo account",

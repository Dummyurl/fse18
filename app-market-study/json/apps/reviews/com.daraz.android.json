This was for a friend of mine and i had to face a big issue because i was unable to gift it on time. I lodged a complaint two weeks ago and is still waiting for the respond. The service was utterly useless and the money paid was not worth it. I would never recommend this site for anyone looking for quality products with good customer service.",

I immediately reported about it but wasnt followed up. Few days later I was informed a representative will contact soon but that was that and I never heard from that phone number. I went to their office and they say its not their jurisdiction to exchange and the courier company will take care of it within 3 days. I waited another month and again went to their office. Then I was given the address to the courier company and was refunded. Total time wasted=2 and a half months. Also they never pick up their mentioned customer care phone number. I seriously recommend to buy only cheap and use and throw type of products from this site. But I am rating 2 star because we can always compare the price with market rate.",

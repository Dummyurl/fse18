My first and only problem surfaced in 2018 on transition to new android 7.0 phone. Developer diligently worked and quickly solved problem. Much more flexibility in this app than I can ever use. 5+ stars",

It's still not a case of offering a Google search pop up as you type in the address field like Google calendar but you now just tap the search button and get a Google map window pop up to search in. In some ways this is better as you can drop pin for the address if you're unsure of the spelling. The android wear face is simple and functional too displaying events around the clock face. And first class developer support too. My current default app as a result of all this and much much more goodness. It isn't the best looking calendar but the functionality makes up for it.",

EVERY update had been reliable and has caused ZERO issues with my phone. I cannot say that about any other app I use or have tried, and that alone is highly commendable! I use the highly customizable scrolling agenda on one of my home screens, a monthly calendar on another, and a yearly calendar on yet another screen and simply could not imagine anything better. When I need to input a new appointment I can copy the original appointment as a new one, simply change the date-time-and notation, and save it before the secretary can hand it to me on a card! I could go on and on. These guys have done an incredible job with an impeccable attention to detail. Yesterday my doctor asked me when I had a certain test done and I had no idea. It was years ago. So, as I have done many times before, I did a simple search, and within a minute gave her the date of my last test two years ago, along with every other time it had been performed, and by whom, going clear back to 2011! She was shocked. Thank-you so much for the incredible job you have done with this app through the years!",

I don't understand how it could be rated less than 5 stars. Anything or any option you may not like about this app you can change it. I keep finding new stuff everyday. They thought of everything. Just found button for adding current time and date stamp to the notes portion of an appointment: so handy! Again this app is the best. With stock Google calendar you can't even duplicate an event. With this app you can duplicate,  send as a text, email or delete an event so easy. Don't get me stated about the search feature. Awesome! It's the only calendar app that let's you search for partial words. If you only know the first name of the person in the appointment and the number portion of the address you put those two in the search field and it will be found. I have almost 6,000 appointments in my calendar and any search takes less that a second to show compete results. Again amazing app. I know I'll continue to find more things about this app that will make it even better but for now it's wonderful!",

It was stable and worked perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Android 4.4.2),and on my LG G4 (Android 5.1.0), and ran perfectly on the same LG G4,  now with Android 6.0!",

And the developer, Dominique, very quickly answers any question which I have in an understandable way. I also like that I can view and/or print multiple or individual calendars which only show the info which I want to show. Well done my Friend!!",

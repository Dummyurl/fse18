        "comment": "You guys need to write a better algorithm to allocate cabs in busy areas. Its taking a lot of time to get the details of the cab after we hit confirm.   And also, you should provide some compensation of any type  for the time we are made to wait before the driver cancels the ride. Some drivers are making us wait for 15 to 20 mins and then cancel out the ride stating no reason at all. And we have to go through the pain of booking another cab again.   It would be great if we are provided with an option to switch to another cab if another cab is available and is nearby.  Its a great app but we need it to be an awesome one.",

And also, when booking multiple stops, its not working as well, it won't let me book. It doesn't show the last stop and it doesn't compute the total fair. It only shows the map and that's it. I already reinstalled it many times and still doesn't solve the problem. Already clear the cache and still nothing.",

It also doesn't locate where you are so your Uber can pick you up from where you are exactly instead of having to walk to a spot you didn't pick yourself. I'm going to try Lyft and see if that's any better.",

Explained my situation & got forwarded multiple times only for them to tell me there's nothing they can do.

The driver is kind enough to told me when i just booked the Uber X, that the price that showed in the app just the estimated price, but... it should wrote estimate price (but there's no). And in the details of my trip in my email, it wrote the distance 89 kilometer, i was like.. whaaat??!! But from the airport to my home is like 29 kilometer and i pay the toll too.. I feel this so unfair, i like uber but yesterday was really bad experience, i feel decieved. what i like from yesterday is the driver (even that he's different person from the picture)",

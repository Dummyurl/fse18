However, this means I have to rotate my CAR or AndroidTV to hit pause?  My car doesn't have an autorotate mode, nor does my AndroidTV.  A couple simple changes and this would be my goto player.  I love the simple interface.  Fits my old school personality well.",

Unfortunately this app plays all my 4.3 ratio videos in 16.9 and makes them look ridiculous. A very basic player and having to keep turning the phone into portrait mode to access the controls is absolutely ridiculous ... uninstalled.",

Wow was I wrong this app does not even identify itself to Android that it handles media files so if you want to open media from an external app forget about it you have to drudge thru your filesystem. Thank goodness for the two hour Google Play Refund Policy! On the plus side the interface is pretty.",

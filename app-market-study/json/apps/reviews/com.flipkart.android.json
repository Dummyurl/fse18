I want to gift it to my mother on her birthday and these stupid things are happening.   No COD on Redmi Note 5 pro.....! are you jocking....? What do you want...? Should I pay an amount of about 14000 and if there is any problem in that product, will you return that amount as fast as we paid...? Well I don't think so... Why should I give you my whole salary of a month for 2 days... Are you..",

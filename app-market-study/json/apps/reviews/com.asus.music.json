On a few occassions it wont project the sound out to my BT speaker, had to enable and disable BT a few times till it works. The EQ control is good, maybe thanks to the good audio hardware bass is maintained even at full volume on headphones.",

But when I close and open it again, the error happens.  The second bug is when the song is played, the display time of the song doesn't run. It stuck on 00:00, although the song runs well. For the beginning until the end of the song, it still shows us 00:00.  The third bug is when I play one song, and then I click back, the song that is played on the screen is the song below the song. For the example, I play \"I Love You\". The song below \"I Love You\" is \"Zombie Everywhere\". When \"I Love You\" is running, the screen shows \"Zombie Everywhere\".  I don't know how to explain it clearly, but I hope Asus fix it and it will be perfect.  The last, please add 'instrumental singing version' built in.",

It's not really a shuffle if I already know what comes after a certain song. And even if I try to listen to another song, it plays a song I knew was coming still, it doesn't shuffle them at all; like a mixed up playlist or something.",

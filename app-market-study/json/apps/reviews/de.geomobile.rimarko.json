On Moto 360, it keeps timing out, so you have to reactivate the app by swiping up, then swiping left, then pressing \"Open\" to see the list. I have reported to developers. But for now,  it's easier to just use your phone.",

No more having to take out my phone, check my list, put phone away, get some groceries,  take out phone, check list again, etc, etc...I can't wait to see what else it can do. Adding items from my watch would be the bomb...hint...hint",

        "comment": "One of my favourite watch faces to use on a daily basis. The reason I gave 4 stars is that it seems to have some small issues. If there are no calls or texts it doesn't make sense opening the popup. For the stopwatch I get an empty laps list which makes that functionality rather useless. This would be a bonus, but adding a color picker for to create or edit themes would be really nice. Another bonus would be to have the number of the steps at the end of the blue bar giving that that space is not really used for anything. Great jobs guys, another watch face well worth the money.",

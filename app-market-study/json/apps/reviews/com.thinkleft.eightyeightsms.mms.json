Not on sending but please put sim indicator where the message has been sent or received (sim1/sim2) that would be a big help, since dual sim can set the default sim for sending in the main Setting so no need for it. Just help us not to be confused where the msg rcvd or sent like the stock Messaging app. and this is perfect plus elegant! And please add Signature too but a signature like what Textra does wherein you can create multiple, and choose separate it from text editor!",

Most texting apps will let you clear the notification, but it still shows as unread in the app.  8sms lets you clear the notification with a swipe or mark it as read.  Only missing feature is scheduled text.  I would also like to see a little number displayed on the icon when I have unread text.  Many other messaging apps do this and gmail does now as well.",

Offers what other messaging apps don't, which is the ability to have the app turn on and off your mobile data when group messaging or receiving pictures or videos. If you are like me and don't often have your data on,  this feature is very important. That feature alone drifted me towards this app,  but it is also easy to use. It would be nice for this app to have a little more customizability when it comes to the interface, and I wish it displayed unread messages number on the home screen, but other than that,  it is a great app.",

Love the dark theme, and ability to delete all texts at once... but all my incoming mms picture messages are compressed before receiving them, coming in at very low quality (video as well) even after raising the mms size in settings. Outgoing mms my recipients have no issue with quality but sent from them to me its an issue; I cant even read the grocery list my old lady sends me...

This JB/KitKat layout is probably the best minimalist.  It's better than Google's SMS/MMS app called \"Messaging.\"  Although Google's \"Messaging\" is nice, I'm not a big fan of the whole Material Design in Lollipop.  I prefer the older JB/Kitkat layouts of the SMS app.    Because I go back to this app so much, I donated to the developer to show support.  Why? I believe that even if items are given out for free and I tend to use the item frequently, then it is a sure sign that I should donate to support the developer.",

On lollipop, the only way to change a senders notification tone is through the stock app itself. The only thing changeable on lollipop itself is their ring tone.  So I would love it if you guys would add setting for each sender. It most messaging apps long pressing the senders name in the messages list will allow you to change their tone. Something like that would work, or just any way to change it at all.",

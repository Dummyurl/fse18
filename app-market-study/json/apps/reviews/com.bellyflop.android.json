Why not showing business category on the map, just blue and red pointers? Why not showing the business name when clicking the blue marker? Anyway, I think this reward plan is dead.

Should be able to type in a location or address or the name of the restraunt and find it Even while off line like several other apps like this have. Also app does not say how many mbs it plans on installing. Also not much use for it around my area did a zip code search only 4 places have it. Also checked other areas around me all I have total is 9 places between 4 diffrent zip codes.",

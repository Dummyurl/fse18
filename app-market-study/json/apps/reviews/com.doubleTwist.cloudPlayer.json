For instance my ringtones are in the player and I want to remove them but I can't because it deletes it from my phone. Basically a really good app.    Update: Still having problems with Android Auto. Of course no one wants to admit they're at fault. Time to find a new app.",

Much more than even a robust SD card could handle, especially if I want that SD card for other types of storage. After searching many, many apps, this one did what I needed it to do. It streams from my OneDrive perfectly, and when I need music on my device for faster access, I can do that as needed. As a professional musician and music educator, I need this app. It makes my life happy!",

I've set it to autoplay when I plug in my earphones and when I do that but forget to turn on wifi or data (I've allowed it to play using mobile data) first, the app literally freezes my phone. It appears to rapidly skip from one song to the next trying to play but fails and ends up hogging the phone memory and processor. I can't do anything at that point except to restart the phone. 2. Sometimes it fails to go to the next track on my playlist and simply stops so I have to press play again for it to resume.",

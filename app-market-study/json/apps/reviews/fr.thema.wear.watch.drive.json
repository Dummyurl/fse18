I've been looking for a watch face for my new moto 360 sport for a couple weeks now that has the ability to see both the watch and phone batteries, step counter, and weather that uses the standard weather app on the watch. (This one has way more options than these but these are the most important to me)  This is the first one I've found with all these and then some with no glitches that I've seen in the several days that I have been using it! This is the watch face that ceases my quest for the perfect face, I've found it!",

How long has it been on? I left it on the counter for 2hrs and it's still on. Seems like an obvious battery drainer. Switched faces and it immediately turned off. Hope they fix, because otherwise i like it.",

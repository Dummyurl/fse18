        "comment": "Very poor functionality compared to the great desktop version. Buggy timer, often times desyncs and causes massive time logs because it kept tracking time. I had a 250+ hour log one time and no way to undo it or edit it correctly. Slow to load and can't turn it off once you started tracking time. Good ONLY if you use the phone app alone, not alongside the web one. Needs a massive rework.",

Currently, however, the android app is very unstable for me, and as been for some time. It works, but you have to wade through several crashes and restart it to accomplish any task. Toggl desktop rarely works behind a proxy. The site works great, but is a website, and cannot offer the smooth and efficient user experience the applications can.",

        "comment": "It's an okay app for its core functionality. Even though I understand and agree with the limitations for visualizing the data in the mobile compared to desktop, I believe the mobile experience should be really focused on quick start/stop timer interactions. The only facilitation I saw was the stop notification, but none for quick starting a timer. A few really simple ideas would be:  - A default project just like there is on desktop;  - A simple (and please, small) widget that is configured for a specific project and can be toggled from the home screen;  - A public action defined for other apps to quickly toggle timers. Especially useful with launchers like Nova for defining custom gestures in home screen to toggl.",

Either this app was made years ago and has not had a visual refresh or the developer actively turned off tablet support and rotation. Get your act together Toggl, would be better to have a wrapper for your website. Uninstalled.",

Minor issue: Google login button doesn't respond. Huge issue: slow sync. Often results in accidentally mutated records or trashed changes. Example: start a task on Toggl for Web. Then open Toggl for Android, press Stop. Toggl will realise too late that it's due for a sync and you'll have stopped the task that was running last on Android, destructively updating its end time. Request: make Top Projects optional. I never use them and would rather sacrifice the screen space to a search bar for my many projects.",

They include:  - Letting the app go landscape (on my tablet if I have it slotted into my wireless keyboard, it is very annoying to have to rotate it when using this app. No other app on my entire tablet has this issue. This is not a difficult feature) - Add a \"syncing\" message and disallow pressing buttons when you first open it. Sometimes when you have it running on your computer and you open it on your phone it will initially seem like you haven't stopped the timer, or it takes a few seconds to sync up and tell you what's actually on your Toggl.  Other than that, great app that provides a very valuable service for free!",

        "comment": "I'm a happy user of the Toggl web app, but the Android app is unusable. It does not sync project and client names reliably, so items from the web app are often listed with no project/description info on the mobile app.  Worse, it often happens that if you stop the timer on mobile, you'll come back to the web later and find it's been running the entire time.  One nice feature of the mobile app is that it will notify you of a long-running timer that you forgot to stop.  However, this doesn't happen reliably and even when it does, sometimes stopping it on mobile does not register.  Ultimately it's just not reliable enough to use. Otherwise really happy with Toggl and the value it provides for free.  I'll stick to the web app.",

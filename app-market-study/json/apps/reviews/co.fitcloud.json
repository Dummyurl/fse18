        "comment": "When using the app in Sensor only mode (using heart rate monitor) in doors, I found that the unit was still searching for a GPS signal. The Category was set to Running Treadmill while indoors, so Distance is not tracked, would be helpful if stats like pace and distance could be manually updated. The ability to customize what is displayed on wearable android watches would be awesome.",

Pros: easy to use, easy setup, pairs with HR monitor easily, can be uploaded to any social media or just use for yourself off the grid.  Lots of realtime data & graphs INCLUDED IN THE APP (you've already paid once, why use other apps where you pay a monthly fee for charts?).",

(basically an offline version of sports tracker live) I love that I can finally manage my own data! =]   Support this developer! He is doing all the right things and listens to his customers!",

I only had one complaint - archiving my past workouts had to go through the STL website first. Now, with FitCloud, that is no longer the case. Kudos to the developer and thank you!",

        "comment": "I have tried ten different fitness apps.  All have had drawbacks, not least the fact that many require a monthly subscription to make certain features available.  FitCloud provides features for a one-off payment which are normally only available to subscribers to other apps.  These include the ability to set a GPS offset value to correct GPS readings to make altitude measurements more accurate, and good maps and graphs of each activity.  FIles are stored locally and are easily converted to KML or GPX files for use with other apps and programs.    Note that there are no social networking features, so this app may not be for everyone.  But if you don't need social networking, then this might be the app for you.    This app needs to have the ability to import tracks from other apps.  It would then get five stars from me.",

As SportsTrackLive it only uploaded to its own website but now, with the ability to export GPX and KML files, it integrates with RideWithGPS, Strava, etc. Much better than those sites' apps. I commend this developer for doing the right thing and listening to their customers. Wow! (I am not associated with the developer, just a really happy user.)",

But as I may want more controlled lights, I have to decide if I want to switch to hub based solution. Certainly the color realism blows the others away. Ok price for the bulb, but 39 instead of 53 woul be better, but what the heck",

I made the mistake of buying a bunch, and they randomly keep getting disconnected, resulting in all automation being gone until you do a full reset, and even that only fixes them for a few hours. Their customer support won't admit the problem and they're doing absolutely nothing to fixit.  Worst thing since Neato.  How about having the lights reconnect when they lose connection to the cloud?

Just as the others have commented, connectivity issues continuously throws me into an endless loop of frustration rendering this app useless. This should be an easy, frictionless experience. Instead it's a huge disappointment. I'll change my review if it gets fixed. Otherwise it's going back to the store.",

Whilst I prefer the app that was made for the lights, I've found an app called \"ONSWITCH\" works every time. Which is kinda sad considering this app is literally made for my lifx light. Also, I see no real point in their attempt to sell color schemes ,considering you can manually make them such a color.  Fix your s#it! Until you do  I'll be using alternative apps that work better for my light .",

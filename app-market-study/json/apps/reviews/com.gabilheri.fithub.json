That will make the app complete as I have to rely on Pacer app for the social experience ( Pacer does not do data sync with Google Fit but does with apple health and has no Android wear support) which is not so good on Android as it is on iOS. Will really appreciate a response.",

        "comment": "Excited to find this app because it promises to sync data from FitBit and Google Fit to name just a couple of apps/accounts. I have FB and GF authenticated, but steps don't seem to be populating into the app or displaying on my phone (Huawei Watch 2). Also cannot figure out how to access any available options for the watch face (assuming there are any). The issues could also be with the watch since it keeps losing Wi-Fi connectivity. Hoping it's not defective. The steps on my FitBit are greater than what the app is showing, so I still need to figure out what is going on. Other than that this app has an awesome design and is full of information with great potential. Thanks Marcus!",

Once installed it quickly loaded the past history from both Google Fit and Jawbone. After that it barely updated the info from the 2 connected apps. It did once when I rebooted the phone but that was it. Additional reboots did nothing. So far it has been useless as it doesn't update the Jawbone data nor the Google Fit data.

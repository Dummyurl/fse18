You can't even pick which room you need in advance, they let the hotel choose the room type for you. They basically trap people into downloading and using their app which is complete fraud. I will NEVER use this app again and I encourage you all to do the same!!!",

Got to the hotel and they said I couldn't check in because it was past midnight. The hotel was very nice and refunded the money back to hotel tonight. Then hotel tonight wouldn't refund my money back to bank. Saying it would stay as a credit towards my next hotel booking. Why would I use an app called hotel tonight... When I tried to book a hotel... Tonight... And couldn't get a room! It's ridiculous. Still trying to get my money back I to my bank account because I will never book with this app again!",

        "comment": "This app is extremely misleading. They put prices for hotel rooms and steep discounts so you think you're getting a great deal, but when you show up at the hotel they're not giving you the room you thought you were paying for. I attempted to reach out to customer service for assistance with this issue, but they refused to do anything and blamed the hotel for giving us a room valued at half of what we thought we paid for. I will never use this app again.",

I've driven across country multiple times and would book the hotel room about an hour before i knew we would be ready to stop driving. I was never disappointed with the rooms we were able to get and definitely appreciated the pricing. It's just such an easy and convenient app!!",

        "comment": "Update: Still love this app overall, but not as reliable about last year. Used to let me book a room tonight after midnight local time wherever I am. All but 1 of the rooms I've booked have been as expected without having to use multiple apps. That 1 time, the hotel had been shut down for a while. The hotel always has the info, whether I booked it in the parking lot or days ago. By using the map, I can find something close to my destination in larger cities. Used to work great, very sporadic and hard to search rural areas",

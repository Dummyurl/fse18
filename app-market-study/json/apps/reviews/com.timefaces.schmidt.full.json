Would be awesome to see some weekend activities, maybe even Friday night pub, or Wednesday date-night with the wife, maybe a game of bridge or canasta?",

But: I have never seen mr Schmidt waking up nor brushing his teeth - I guess it happens quite early in the morning. Furthermore I do not like the fact that during weekends it still shows Mr Smith working at his desk. Can you add an image of Mr Schmidt mowing the lawn or reading the newspaper? Or even going for a walk with his wife?",

Specified what stations I listened to that did not play at all or was having BT troubles on, they said updated link would be out soon and I waited for that update and still the same problems. BT does not work on most stations and the one local station does not play at all. No since buying full version if they won't fix the free ones problems.",

I was observing network traffic when listening through Chromecast and found that data stream goes from internet radio station to the mobile and then to the Chromecast. In the other side, acorns app (TuneIn) just directed Chromecast to receive the stream from its source. This is besides better for battery life. But I don't like TuneIn. 2. There used to be nice feature that was showing not only current song but also their history. Instead of this I see list of suggested radio stations and they absolutely don't interest me. Please please bring the song history back at least as an option.  Thanks. -Michael-  Ps: I almost paid your app and will surely do it you fix it.",

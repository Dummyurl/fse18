This Dev responded to my inquiries immediately (next day) & gave me a serious treat! If you need a call blocking app this newest version Extreme Call Blocker is so well worth it. Try the non premium Call Blocker to get a taste. Really great apps & very reliable dev support. I'd like to give this app 6 stars! (Never have I said this of any app before) Thank you J! Ian",

My phone often rang before the block, my own calls got dropped, and lately the robocalls were leaving 4 or 5 voicemails for every blocked call. This app stopped everything. With the FCC blocked numbers option on, I immediately stopped seeing any evidence of the growing storm of robocalls. 10-12 calls a day for months to not a single disturbance feels like a miracle!! Highly recommended.",

I've tried many including one that costs $20 and this one DOES work.

I had a small issue when I first installed it but used the \"email dev\" button and had a response within about 4 minutes and he helped me get the issue solved. This app is worth every penny PLUS you get a code for a friend or family member to download it for free if you email them and ask for one. :D Thank you for the awesome app!",

I have purchased this app based on a promise that the blocked caller will never be able to get to my voice mail box and leave me a message but it did not work and they can still leave me a message. I am not using any other app and my phone blocking feature is disabled so what's the heck is going on? I have sent a request to the support email and no response yet!!! I do NOT recommend it",

I was just called 7x by a spam caller and each time, extreme call blocker hung up and blocked them from leaving a vmail. Fantastic app. The only qualm I have it that it deff needs an update to the menus. It would be awesome if they re-designed it with material. Kudos.",

It installs fine, but it does not work anymore. It lets all calls in and does not allow me to send text messages with pictures. The only way to contact their support is by email and they do not respond. I figured that since I paid for this app I would get better support. That is not the case.",

I turned off all other call feature that's defaulted on my phone.   I added the number and chose for it not to go to voicemail BUT it did all day long...regardless of a long tedious effort to follow all instructions.  I would love my $4.99 back OR a SIMPLER way to make it work.",

        "comment": "I'm impressed with the overall performance. The speed of translations is much better than Google. I'm also impressed by the English - Hungarian translation as most engines mangle the differences between the languages. I ran a few often tricky phrases through, and got a good modern day translation each time.  It doesn't seem to know cultural usage, though, which could get an unsuspecting tourist in a hot spot on some phrasings. For example, in Hungarian it is considered highly offensive to use the phrase 'az any\u00e1d' (your mother). Although the technical translation is correct, the culturally acceptable phrase is 'az \u00e9desany\u00e1d' (your sweet mother). It could avoid a punch in the face. \ud83e\udd23  The pronunciation of Hungarian sounds is nearly native and the spoken speed and intonation is spot on.  There is some tooling confusion in the UI between pins and stars. I don't think it's intuitive to maintain two lists. The pins are also a bit buried under the recent icon while starred phrases appear prominently in the phrasebook, leading the unsuspecting user to believe their pins didn't save if they assume they will appear in the phrasebook.  It is also a bit tedious to have to select a language pair on every panel (spoken vs typed, etc). The app should allow you to adjust the pairing throughout rather than individually. There is no easy swap to reverse translate either. You have to individually select each side of the language pair when you want to reverse them.  Overall, the performance and beautiful interface outweigh the app's minor shortcomings.",

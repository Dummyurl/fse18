Just launch the app from your watch and it automatically opens up a live feed on the watch display giving you a view of what your phone camera is focused on. I use it all the time for checking in hard-to-reach places at work.",

Not sure if that helps refresh yet works well all over house with minimal lag. Good job! Only 2 suggestions, where available use WiFi rather than Bluetooth and  a frame rate so you can see it's actually updating (especially if your using it to keep eye on the kids in another room).",

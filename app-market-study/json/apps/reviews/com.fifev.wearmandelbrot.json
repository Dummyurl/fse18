        "comment": "Bravo. This is simply amazing. Some key improvements for new versions would be maybe an easier way to switch fractals. It's super hard (for me) to switch to the Julia Set. Maybe have some sort of menu you begin with to choose which set to look at? Second, make it even more smooth. At times it becomes hard to focus in on what you want. That's all, other than that.. AMAZING.",

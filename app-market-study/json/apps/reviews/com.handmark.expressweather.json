But I wish there were more widget sizes and an option to show the weekly forcast on the front of it.  Also, I would rather not have the integrated Google search bar on the widget. I'd give it the last stst if these were included in future updstes. Still, it's the best one I have tried and I bought the ad-free version.",

Unfortunately, I cannot stop it from having an ongoing notification on my lock screen even after I have shut this function off in the settings. I have a widget, I have the weather in the left hand corner on my phone, and I can click on it anytime I want to get the weather I do not need a notification on my lock screen and on my top bar. When someone stops this in the settings it should stop it. Fix this and it'll get five stars from me!",

But, unfortunately, I can only rate this app three stars due to the unreliability of the forecast.  The forecast sometimes seems to be exaggerated; the lows are sometimes too low and the highs are sometimes too high.  I took a screenshot earlier today as proof, but I don't think that there is a way to share that image in this review.  If you will please fix this issue, I will be more than happy to rate this app five stars.  Thank you.",

I've used it in the past but recently bought it and started using it as my main weather app.  One annoying problem is that the temperature values on the \"Detail\" forecast are usually much different than the temperature values in the other forecasts. They are for the same time/date but the values are different.",

Had to use the color pallet provided to create a solid sky blue background. Since this is a weather app that should have been a default choice. Also the app stores all those photo backgrounds in my photo gallery. I didn't know it was gonna do that and don't like it. Also it runs in the background when not in use. Should have an option in the menu to turn it off when not in use to conserve battery.  But bad backgrounds choices aside this is a decent app so I give it 4 stars.",

        "comment": "So this app came pre installed on my phone which I'm not happy about because I feel we should have a choice on what weather app we wanna use and not have one shoved down our throats. I quit using this app years ago because of the way it is first it doesn't even show how much snow or rain we are gonna get in inches which is usually a good thing to know if you are planning a trip anywhere also the radar needs a future forecast added to it so we can see the future on about how long the snow or rain is gonna last by seeing it on the radar and I think they should add some videos to the app as well. But the biggest thing like I mentioned already add how many inches we are gonna get of what its doing outside being snow or rain.",

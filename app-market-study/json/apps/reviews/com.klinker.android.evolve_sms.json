Looks fantastic, feels great.. And if you're too tight to pay the nice developers for there hard work, then you lose out!!! You get what you pay for.. No adverts or anything that pesters you to spend more money.. I love it!! Thank you \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",

Not sure why it just stops receiving texts, sometimes it's because I forget to turn off VPN, stock app works with VPN. But other times it just doesn't work.  Was using it on One Plus 5 stock Hydrogen. Latest is Hydrogen updated to Oreo. Seems to be OK so far with most things, but not changing rating because can't set ringtones. Can select them, but they don't take, at all. Back to stock messaging app for now.",

        "comment": "Just about perfect. I love the dark theming.  The live preview widgit is awesome. General UI layout it the best ever. I love swiping between conversations and having the list on the left in portait mode. Powerful tools  I wish this would be able to integrate Facebook messenger where it combines SMS and fb conversations in line like Windows phone 7 used to. That was powerful but fb broke it.  Small UI suggestions: Use parallaxing on elements to give a subtle 3d look. Squish bounce the screen when you scroll to the bottom.  Small usability issues: Sometimes it splits my conversations into two conversations with the same contact. Sometimes it loads photos a little clunky, lag where it has to reload. Textra feels a bit snappier the evolve  By far the cleanest, best overall app on the market! Well worth the money.",

Doesn't work correctly with adding stuff from Google keyboard like gifs as instead of inserting into the current message it makes a new one that you have to put the contacts in for.  I'm not a huge fan of how it displays certain aspects like media in messages while composing.  The draft prompts are nice but can be intrusive during use.  Overall it's pretty good but it's rough around the edges.  If these were addressed and cleaned up along with some other stuff like stability it would be great for sure.",

No I don't expect you to work for free, that's why I pay for apps (over $166 spent on apps actually, your theme add- on among them). Your app is no where near good enough to merit the arrogant attitude  you have. The app itself is laggy and chances are won't ever change if sliding messaging is any indication. Just google search \"Klinker brothers\" and the first link will take you to a thread filled with people who experienced similar disrespect at the slightest criticism.

        "comment": "I love a lot of things about this texting but the biggest drawback for me is the \"Conversations\" page. I wish it would cover the whole screen, not just a little more than 3/4 of the screen.  I will say, they have the best delayed texting. When you send the message it basically outboxes it into the message field and you can start another text. So if for example your delay time is 30 seconds, you could hit send and it will outbox them for 30 seconds individually (obviously you can cancel them) then send them. Pretty much every other messaging app that has the delay doesn't offer that. When you hit send they force you to wait until it sends before you can begin typing another text, which can be kind of annoying if you are responding to several different text or different topics within a text and breaking it up.  Trying to find one that has a better \"conversations\" page. This will do for now.",

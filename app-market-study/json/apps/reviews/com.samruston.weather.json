That said, where's my favourite Easter egg gone when searching for a date in the future (via a calendar)?? I'm sad if it's been removed.",

Uninstalling and going to paid version of Weather UG.  WOW, I posted the above review 11.28.17 and ZERO response from the developer and no update to fix the issue.",

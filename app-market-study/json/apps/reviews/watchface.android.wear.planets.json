I do wonder though if the animation causes an excessive drain on the battery as I cannot make it a full day without charging my watch, whereas my coworker who also has a moto360 has no issue (different watch face).   I will experiment with the animation turned off and see if that improves the battery life.  Update: I have tried using the watch face with animations turned off but I still found that my battery was draining quickly. For comparison, I put on my watch at 7:30am with the planet watch face, animations off, and by 9:30am I was at around 82% charge. With the standard watch face, I took my watch off the charger around 7:45am and at 9:15am I am still at 95%.   This is a fantastic watch face, but the amount of drain on the battery makes using it impractical.",

If you could add options to change the colours of the planets, and to remove/alter the second hand comet, that would be amazing. Also - very nit picky, but I'd love the sun to be a yellow ball in dimmed mode. Well done guys!",

        "comment": "Lovely and simple watch face.  Really pleased it isn't just an animation of the planets circling around the centre, but is updated in real time.  Only one downside, there is no Pluto...   Also, a suggested improvement, other than adding Pluto (obviously), would be to format the edges to better suit square watch faces e.g.. moving the outer border line, and time markers.",

I do miss some of the other features from the other faces I use, e.g. battery indicator (it'd be cool if you used the sun for this!) and adjusting the time it takes to dim so I can fully appreciate the animation. Overall, it looks awesome and it's free, so I can't really complain.",

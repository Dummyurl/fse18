I recently had a problem  when the app wouldn't open, so I contacted viewranger support and received  fantastic help from a chap named Mike, who soon had me up and running again.  Altogether brilliant!",

It enables you to easily plan routes on the pc then sync to your phone to use out. Doesn't need service to track via gps. Never had any issues. Highly recommend it! But wish it were more known and social!  Also wish there was a way to see all tracks I've recorded on the website on the PC! Asking too much? Maybe but you guys can develop that \ud83d\ude09",

Also as a backup for paper map to make sure we are on track especially in bad weather (fog) . Handy pause button for stops of refreshments. Even better with the bigger screen of the Hudl 2 . Thanks for such a useful app.",

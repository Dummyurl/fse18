We also need a way to post our shoes for cycling in the Gear section, we can do our bikes and addons to that but no shoes. How do you stop automatic upload of our rides?",

        "comment": "I use this wonderful free app for documenting the statistics of  my bike rides, and on my rare jogs. A minor issue is that it fails to record, and goes to finish screen. It happened today, and I had to manually add my data. I reinstalled it just now, and hope that it doesn't happen again. The app also has problems on tracking slow walks. But given that everyone uses it, it is also a great way to see how our peers and friends do, and get inspired. I wish that the company offers the paid version more cheaply in India. It will get many customers.",

You can assess your own progress and identify areas of improvement. Best of all, you have this cycling biographer always by your side, noting down your every struggle and your every accomplishment, making sure your unforgettable ride truly is unforgettable! As with all apps, there are a few bugs here and there, but overall, Strava receives a massive thumbs up from me.",

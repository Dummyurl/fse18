It would be nice to have ability to change layout to have two tokens in a single row. Also, fingerprint security or pin are needed in app like this, please implement.",

The accounts aren't labelled at the top level, this just creates an added step of having to long press the account to find out which it is.  Either more logos for other services (Google is literally the only one in my list of 8 accounts that has an icon) or add some generic icons for things like email. Even better, add the account names to the main page above the email address. The email address alone is not sufficient",

At first, I thought there wasn't a timer (a basic feature to know if your code is about to expire), but then I realized that the color fades the closer the code is to resetting.  At the moment, this a four-star app. I would love to see the ability to add our own custom icons because right now, there are only about 30 built-in ones. That means a majority of my OTP codes have the generic star. That makes it a bit hard to differentiate between the codes. To remedy this, instead of inputting my login the OTP is associated with, I input the website. Not ideal.  Furthermore, I'd like to see the addition of custom groups or labels, and a search function. If any/all of these are implemented, I'll update this review to five stars.",

The bad: the limited list of icons for services makes it difficult to tell what stuff some stuff is. Perhaps being able to select a custom vector or image would help. The list is extremely inefficient when you have a lot of accounts. Items being more compact would be much appreciated.  The ugly: accounts in the list view only show the email it's under, omitting the service it's for.",

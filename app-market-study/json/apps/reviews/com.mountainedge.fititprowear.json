        "comment": "Nice to have more Fitbit notification options on my Zenwatch but all of the single bar widgets are missing the bottom 25% of the bar on my Note 3 so I can't see all of the info being tracked. May have to uninstall... when I run I need to be able to simply raise my Zenwatch & see my steps.  All I can see is \"FitIt\"... not convenient to use other hand. Also it's a bit of a kludge to only be able to reach the Settings window by tapping the main, rotating, multi-bar widget. Why not from the main \"Install\" icon?",

        "comment": "This app worked flawlessly for some months. Since last week it crashes permanently, every few seconds, leaving Android to state: \"Unfortunately, FitIt Wear Pro for FitBit\u00ae has stopped.\" It's updated. So is the FitBit app, which shouldn't really matter anyway. I reconnected it to the FitBit webapp, giving the proper pin. It then actually displays correct data in the 4x2 widget. But it still keeps crashing. Using Samsung Galaxy S5 Android 4.4 and LG G watch Android 5.1.1.",

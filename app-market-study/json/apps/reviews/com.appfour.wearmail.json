I've generated new app passwords, then disabled app passwords all together, nothing works. Can't find a way to contact any type of support team. Until this issue is fixed, I cannot recommend this app.",

Somedays I'll end up with 150 separate notifications, that's way too much. If there was an option to eliminate individual notifications and just announced you have 150 emails, that way you could open the app itself to view them would be great. Uninstalling for now until such a feature is available.",

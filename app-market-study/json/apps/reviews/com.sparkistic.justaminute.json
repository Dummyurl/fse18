Pleased with the customisable options which accompany the purchase. The only thing which saves the face getting a full 5 stars is subscription weather. I hear what the dev says about the quality, but could we not at least have the option of a no cost (but not as accurate) setting? Echo others in hoping complications are on route also.  Nice, clean, usable face - thanks.",

I really like the pro features, keep up the good work guys!  Some suggestions from my side: 1. A way to select the weather provider because I have different forcasts on my phone and watch (s7 default forcats provider is AccuWeather) 2. Display only the batery procentage without the icon (IMO it occupies too much space)",

People would rather pay for the app as a one time thing only than have a monthly subscription since Google app can give you that info for free. If you guys turn it into a paid app you are gonna sell way more than using the subscription. I've seen lots of comments like mine around the subscription for getting additional stuff. Other than that it is great app!",

        "comment": "I use Poweramp all the time and this app is perhaps the single most useful thing I could have on a smartwatch.  There is ONE thing I wish I were be able to do though, and I really hope you add it soon:   I want to able to select from a list of albums by a single artist. Right now, the album list simply shows ALL the albums by ALL the artists in my library. And selecting an artist from the artist list takes me to a list of ALL that artist's tracks. I want to be able to select an artist and be taken to a list of that artist's albums. This would make it much faster to navigate to a specific track, since I don't want to scroll through every single album in my library, and I don't really want to search by talking into the microphone either. Please consider allowing the user to browse through albums by a single artist; this would make it a five-star app for me. Thank you.  PS: If somehow there actually is a way to do what I described without talking into the microphone, please let me know, but as it is I don't think there is a way to do it yet.",

        "comment": "This worked perfectly on a Note 3 running Android Lollipop 5.0. I have since upgraded to 5.1.1 and it appears that the controls now only work intermittently. Usually while (or shortly after) the phone's screen is on and unlocked which somewhat defeats the purpose of this application. Album art and information is displaying and the native Android Wear music controls seem to function without issue so I don't think it's a connectivity problem?  Is this perhaps a power saving issue when the phone screen is off? This was a five star app before this issue and if it could be resolved it would be again.",

Either this is a bug in the software or I have something set wrong. If this is fixed my rating will be 5 stars, because its frustrating to not be able to see all my songs.",

Only complaints is that changing tracks from the app does not work (selecting tracks from the track list) and that the notification card looks incomplete. I would like a better look of the album art for the notification card. Other than that, the app is excellent. New UI looks great",

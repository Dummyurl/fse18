I am thoroughly impressed that you, after the add free period, only ask $3.49. Thank you so much for a wonderful app at an incredibly affordable price. My wife and I have shelved Messages (the SMS app that came installed on our Galaxy S8 phones) and use Textra exclusively.",

This is the first app I downloaded, and it's just as great as I remember, and in face has gotten better (which I thought it was amazing to begin with, so that's quite a feat!).  The features are amazing, the customization is great. It's seamless.   Simple, streamlined, clean app that works just like the stock app SHOULD.  Pop ups,  group messaging,  everything just works amazingly well.  Definite five stars :-)",

Secondly, on my Note 4 I could use the volume buttons to increase and decrease the size of font in a text. A definite 5 stars if these 2 features could be added.",

I wish it had an option to show a contact's messages with different numbers in one thread.   Edit: New version contains ads on top of the conversations list \u2013 regression.  Edit2: A Delete button on the notification to delete the message without opening the app would be great.",

However, i noticed recently that sometimes I would not receive people's text and they would ask if I received their text. This is how I know something was wrong with my Textra. I had to use the stock message app to avoid missing anyone's text. I really would like to start using Textra again since it's more convenient and easy to use. Please help me resolve this issue!! It's the only thing that's preventing me from using Textra as my default message app.",

I had previously tried others and went back to stock Samsung Messages app. But I'm glad I found Textra, which is now my default SMS app!! Simple to use, customizable but not confusingly so, looks great, very fast. Great customer support, too. The ads are minimal and not invasive, but I'm still considering the small fee of 2.99 to remove them. Highly recommend!!!",

It seems to me that would be a very useful tool to avoid having to open the phone then open the app then open the message. I mean most SMS messages are so short the whole message is there in the drop version. Make the change and 5 stars.

I had problems with sending long messages using the built in samsung messaging app but using textra, wow it surprised me. It gives me a lot more capabilities with texting. Using a samsung i cant use some of the emojis i have with others who use another version of android. But textra comes with a feature where u can change the style of emojis which i day is a great touch. The level of customizability is tremendous and intuitive. Everything is easy to find and easy to change. It has a great notification system which i truely adore aswell. This might aswell be the greatest messaging app of all time in my opinion",

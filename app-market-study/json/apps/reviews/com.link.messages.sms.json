I understand there are going to be a lot of ads etc. However, it tried to take over other functions of my phone. Such as lock screen settings. I was asked to review the app and I selected to do so later. Immediately after rejecting to review/rate the app I am being bombarded with \"failed message\" notifications to messages that do not exist. For this very reason I selected to have notifications for every message delivered. This continues to happen. I just haven't deleted the app because I need to use my sms until I find a better app.",

        "comment": "Do you read your reviews? First being, how many reviews stated that they were deleting cuz of adds? Bad choice guy. If less adds equals continued customer and more choice to entice customer to pro then you still have that customer. But you don't have that choice once they delete app. Its strange you want to make your money from add customers and not cuz of a quality product when you indeed have such. That's called greedy and not proud of your product. Don't be greedy and in time Your product will stand on its own with lots of customers and less adds. Number two issue is I have to stop to let the texting catch up. And I'm not even the fastest typer. Its very frustrating. If I'm excited or even angry and therefore passionate about what I'm texting to someone, I don't want to have to stop...wait...for...the...words...I...text...to...catch...up...get it? Number three, when I choose a theme, should it not over ride any background pic I formerly decided to choose? The theme pops up on the keyboard and the boarder of background wallpaper behind the messages but the pic I had chosen as my wallpaper prior to the theme remains. It looks choppy as they are nowhere close to being anything of the same topic. If I can't get this resolved I will not keep app as I'm all about the visuals. Last but not least, when I'm composing a msg, the keyboard stays on top of the msg. I cannot see what I'm typing. Why? I'm a terrible typed and must review what I'm composing. I shouldn't have to minimize the keyboard to do this. I have never had to do so until I added your app.",

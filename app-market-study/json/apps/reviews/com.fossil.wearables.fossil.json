Now I'm totally studied note with the app even though I still believe the interface can be made both more simple & useful",

Here's an idea for the next update, make the app consider Whatsapp, Telegram, or Line calls as regular calls or make them as separate notifications. Now, when i get any calls from those apps, it thinks i just got a new message.",

Q legacy app is much more detailed and intuitive. I wish this app shows more details about live sleep and deep sleep atleast. What is the use of a sleep tracker that is unable to show you details of your sleep. Please add this feature so that I'll be happy to recommend this over to others",

Bought the watch yesterday and love it, the app would be fine but it renders the watch completely useless because it won't show notifications if the phone is in do not disturb mode, or even if the phone is on silent. Why would I need the watch to tell me I have a message or a call when the phone is ringing and/or vibrating? Surely the whole point it to be discreetly notified of a call or message from a preferred contact WITHOUT the phone ringing or vibrating!? I can see many others who agree but I am concerned that the response from the developers is not positive. Unfortunately I will have to return the watch while I can as I can't risk waiting to find out if this issue is rectified or not and ending up with a nice but pointless smartwatch.",

While I can understand the new feature of \"notifications now respect phone's do not disturb mode\" this ruins the watch for me as the whole point of the watch is to get notified by it while I can leave my phone totally silent (i.e. no ring or vibration). To do that you need to enable do not disturb (alarms only) mode. Due to the update I can no longer keep my phone silent AND get watch notifications which is very unfortunate. PLEASE add a feature to make this optional. That all being said on a positive note it appears connectivity reliability has been greatly increased which is nice to see. EDIT: I appreciate the response but the point was missed. When I mean silent I mean no ring OR vibration on the phone, and only vibration being by the watch. Since Android 7 the only way to do this is via Do Not Disturb (Alarms Only) being turned on which is why I am not a fan of the new update in the regards.",

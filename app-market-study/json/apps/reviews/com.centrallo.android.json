Every other productivity app in the market has this feature, I don't know why Centrallo doesn't. Still no recurring reminders although you can add more then one reminder to a note which is nice. It would also be nice to have the option to sort lists by color so I can see the priority items marked on the top of a list. And what the heck is the radar feature for? Other then that, Centrallo works great.",

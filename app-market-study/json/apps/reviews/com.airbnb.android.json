From the travel side, difficult to see distacne to unit you may be booking from area you desire to stay. ...often property is 50 miles from where you think you're booking.

That's why I've asked for a supporter to interfered in. She told me to cancel the booking then help me for the refund. Eventually, i didn't even get my full refund because she couldn't reach the host over the issue. I've lost the 50% refund and the service fee,worse, i gotta to looking for a new room.",

        "comment": "I've been looking for an app that shows me constantly the battery level of my phone/watch while they're charging and notifies me when they're fully charged. There was nothing actually, all I've found was apps that shows only one device. Then I found this. It shows me the battery level of my watch when its charging and vice versa. Very useful if you charge one of your devices far from you. I wonder why this app isn't popular, everyone needs this. Good job dev! I hope you continue working on this. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

It just looks like an empty space up there. Even a white outline around the icon would make it more visible. Aside from that, it works as I would expect it to.",

My watch already shows me the phones battery at all times, it'd be nice the other way around too. Great job Dev, keep it up!",

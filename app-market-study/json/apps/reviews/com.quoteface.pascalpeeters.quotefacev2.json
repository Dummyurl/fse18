Have an option to turn off vibrate notification. * doesn't update to the stocks I type in and click ok * should be a drop down menu for currency, not hand typed.   * go from portrait orientation to landscape orientation, back to portrait the fonts get all jacked up. *  took 3-4 days for the app to pop up on my watch to install.",

        "comment": "Like the design layout on the watch, but phone app lacks in field labels and some indication that confirms communication.  A simple FAQ would be good about proper field entry, etc.  Bummer..this app does not work on the latest smartwatch Fossil Q Explorist GEN3 which runs AW natively.  Have gone through reviews, tried suggested methods to resolve, but still no updates to initial entries.  Also, when searching for this Wear in Store, it doesn't show (perhaps needs to be marked as compatible)  Would really like to see this work.",

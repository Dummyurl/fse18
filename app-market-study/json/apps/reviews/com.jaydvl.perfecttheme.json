The font in message conversatioj which i send is in white color, when the background is white too. I hardly can't see what I texting before. Is that bug or maybe there's something I don't know about setting appearance? It's Lil anoyyed me, but you do a great job with this theme",

Ticks every box in CM theme selector which is impressive, especially with a free theme. I'm using it with Flat Style xposed module to get the matching coloured status bar. Awesome stuff. Update with optional, dark UI elements is great.",

I dislike the opaque Quick Tile background and would rather have it be transparent. The notifications for Gmail could also look better as right now it just looks as if it was shoehorned in there. Overall, app was nice but of course there can be improvements. Hope to see updates.",

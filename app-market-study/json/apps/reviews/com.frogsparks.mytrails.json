Full of light, rich maps. (It works offline for sure!) 3. It is accurate.  4. Has light, nice interface. Easy to manage trough the menus even for novices. 5. Does not use lot of storage. 6. Smallest RAM/processor usage than any other, best battery saver outdoor app. 7. The only with auto pause - waypoint mark on no movement detection. 8. Smallest storage for downloaded maps. (A not so big whole mountain took under 3MB with clear visible waypaths)  9. Attention! It works with G Services disabled! 10. It does not make one internet dependent. 9. Im sure have missed more good things, but summary: it\u2019s some between AK-47 and Ornella Muti in \u201977. Cons: Would be nice to make photos on waypoints. Future: Keep it simple. The conclusion after simultaneous comparison between BackCountryNavigator, OSMand, GPSEssentials, Polaris, AllTrails and many others.

It is very complicated to use but worth the effort to get it working - I didn't read the manual (tried!) but managed to get it to work by fiddling around with the settings. Downloading the area before a walk means being able to trace the route on the go. Would be difficult, as well as expensive, to get a signal on Dartmoor so this is the perfect fix. The OS maps are brill and for around \u00a35 for one year, very cheap.",

I know GPS reception is not good in these places, but this app accepts all data que GPS sensor delivers. It seem to have no filter. In this situation (poor GPS) sometimes i \"walk\" up to a mile away in distance and return back to the same place in a couple of seconds, and this app accept this data as valid points. As a result the tracks inside cities  is a collection of rubish. I realize now that my old S3 should had a very good GPS sensor.

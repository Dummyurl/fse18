The board says 12 min for the J and the M isn't even on the board. I can see 4 stops away since we're above ground and there's no train in sight. So this app is basically useless.",

However, I mainly use this app to check the bus schedule here in Montreal and it is pretty bad at it in my opinion. First of all, you can't save a specific direction of bus or even save a stop to quickly check the arrival times. Second is that when I don't know what stop I am going to be at, the map showing the bus route is pretty troublesome to navigate through. This app has a lot going for it, but if it fails at doing the most basic thing of giving bus schedules, then as soon as another real time bus schedule is available, I will jump and go try that one instead.",

        "comment": "Essential app for straphangers! It makes getting around on transit a breeze. Real-time departures, automatic rerouting if you miss a connection, audio reminders for when to leave/get off... It's everything I need and even some things I didn't realize I wanted. It can be a bit of a data hog, but that may be because I always have it open since it's such a joy to use.",

In the latest version, some bus lines show every single arrival on the main page taking up too much space. Times are not that accurate either. Sometimes the app doesn't refresh arrival times on first lookup. But it does provide routes and transportation based on location. Overall so so",

There's that new \"Routine\" feature that came out which you can initiate a batch of events through a single command.  If I could say \"hey Google, I'm done working\", I'd like to have one of these actions to be Transit that launches the optimal bus route to go home from my position in Go mode, and provide realtime location data to other users around me who uses the same bus route.",

However it isn't just the app, but the on ground service has some distance to travel, that too rather quickly, to earn one more that's five stars. Love you folks.",

There needs to be a \"I'm currently on this bus\" option.   When the app crashes, bugs or desynchronizizes with the actual bus departure it's very frustrating to tell it I'm ALREADY on the bus to get your notifications back and provide crowdsourcing data to other passengers.   Will give 5 stars eventually but it's hardly a polished product.",

This has caused a lot of confusion and frustration, especially when you think your train will arrive in 2 minutes but it was actually giving you times for the same line in the opposite direction. Seems like a huge flaw that should not have escaped testing stages.",

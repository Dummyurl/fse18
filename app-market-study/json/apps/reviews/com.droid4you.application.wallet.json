A user needs that button maybe once or twice in a lifetime. Other such decisions make me think this app needs a ux overhaul, especially since it has too many features, a classic case of can't see the forest for the trees...",

A possible fix could be the option to apply certain charts we select to only certain accounts... Or having the option to use the old UI.  Also... If I do select an account at the top to do a reconcile (switching transactions from cleared to reconciled) it works but then deselects the account and I have to go up to the top and select it again to do the next transaction.  I guess I can try going to \"Records\" and screwing with the filters a bit.",

Hint: if people use and pay for your app, chances are they like it the way it is. Instead of fixing existing bugs in the app, how about we change the design like nobody wanted, and add some new bugs in the mix? Seriously, guys... I have split an expense... one half of that expense has disappeared from that account... Guess what? This never happened before the app got the big design update...

Just 3 things that needs to be done and it will be 100% perfect:  1- to have an account type as credit card where I can enter the limit amount, balance, and due .. currently I am adding credit card as a regular account and putting it's balance in negative which affects the reports when I transfer from my regular account to the credit card account.  2- when creating a group and adding a member, when I try to change the permission to read only and save, it doesn't save and remains on admin access  3- Please allow to add a label when creating a record, cause everytime I create a record I need to edit the record again to add a label to it.  Even with the above the app is still more than awesome, and I will keep using the paid version. Just hope you guys fix the above, but please do it so users can modify without losing or messing up their previous data   Thanks a lot and keep it up \ud83d\udc4d  Update: I decreased my rating to 4 stars because of the support service, I tried several times to send them about issues and features request and they always give you a copy paste replies that are sometimes even irrelevant",

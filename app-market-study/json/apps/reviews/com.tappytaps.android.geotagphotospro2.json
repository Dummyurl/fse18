        "comment": "I have too many problems with errors in the logs for this to be a proper solution. The app uploads more than one log file for each trip, and splits the trip into several <trkseg> in the gpx files. Usually all the data is there (at least as far as I can see), but I have to manually edit the gpx files every single time to get the desktop app to accept them. I will instead look for another app to log my trips and create the gpx files and use your excellent desktop app to tag the photos. \u2013 EDIT: I now realised your desktop app doesn't accept GPX files from other apps than your own. So I'm using GPS Logger for Android and GeoSetter for Windows instead.",

At the price of this app, I'd expect a graceful service degradation. I.e. the app should still work, but syncing should be deferred.

I discovered that was my fault because I forgot to reset the camera date/time to allow for daylight saving time. So...I got it changed and all synced.   I just went on another photo tour. I did not get a single tab even though the desktop app said it had tagged all photos. Some of these locations I stumbled across so did not have addresses for them. I counted on GeoTag to tell me where I was at the time. Very disappointed!  UPDATE: I just discovered you can change the time on the photos to match the difference from the phone. So I went back and tried to re-tag all photos from the days I had the time on camera wrong. NOTHING!  This App Is No Good!",

It fails to track you accurately and plonks geo-positions all over the place often hundreds of metres away from the track you actually walked along.   It's only useful if you want to know which county you're in, more-or-less, and will tend to lumps great wads of your photos in the same location.  Sorry, but I regret that I paid for this. I'm now using Geo Tracker (which is a bit basic) and I'm learning ViewRanger GPS (not entirely intuitive but I'm getting there).",

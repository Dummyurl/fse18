I've noticed this trend of making wearable apps more expensive than the smartphone ones. Maybe people think that if you are going to shell out 300bucks for a watch, it means you're rich (and stupid) enough to buy every app that adds a basic function to it so you don't have to wait 2 months for an update. It needs a 2weeks trial version.",

It tells you that you need at least 10 minute warning to cancel your taxi but i was stood on the ice with my sister who also was on her way to work till 2 minutes past its due arrival time only then to get a message that there was not a taxi in our area. This is unexceptable not only are we missing an hour of our work shifts pay but we also had to pay a lot more for a last minute taxi pick up.",

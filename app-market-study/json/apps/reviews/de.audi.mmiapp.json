My previous Chevy was much more advanced. It also doesn't save your parking location without connecting to the car wifi for some reason (rather than using the monthly Audi Connect service I pay for). This app seems to exist solely for the purpose of saying \"there is an app.",

If I don't run Amazon music through the MMI the car locator works fine, this is an error that needs fixing by the developers.  As I now have one function working or the other but not both!!!  Agree with other reviewers that the functionality is not exactly state if the art for the price we're paying for the cars and options!",

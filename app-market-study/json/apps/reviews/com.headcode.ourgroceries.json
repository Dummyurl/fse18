If I say chamomile vanilla tea, it adds vanilla and cuts off the other words. No matter how many times I try it insists on cutting off extra descriptive words very irritating. It should just transcribe what I say and not try to match what I say to some predefined grocery list. Update: I have to drop it to 2 stars because this thing about only adding words that is on a predefined list is just too irritating. I am actively looking for an alternative.",

Also if we go shopping together we can split up  with the kids and take one half of the store. We can see what each other has gotten or not gotten. I like the photo feature in the paid version.  I can take a pic of what I need and he knows exactly what to get.  Only two apps I live by,  this, Our Groceries and ScreenTime for my kids!!  One keeps track of my groceries and other keeps track of my kids \ud83d\ude09",

Being able to locate items at the different stores faster would be great because every store arranges their store differently (by aisle # or section, ie. housewares or electronics) Also I agree with others about deleting items off the list being too easy especially with the widget.

The only suggestion I have is to make every shopping list capable of being sorted into their own aisles and categories.

They don't have the same shelf layouts, so currently one of my lists has to have all items uncategorised as categories for the other supermarket are different.",

It would also be nice that once the cost were entered it could give you an estimate of your next shopping trip as you add items to your list. Thanks for this program!",

Easy to use, customizable categories, web site support for managing and adding. Never an issue with syncing like I was having with the other app. I like being able to add stuff by voice, and it has an option to stay in the add field which makes it super easy to add a bunch of stuff quickly.   You can add entire recipes, but I've never found that useful. Also the info icon for editing the item is fine, but clunky. Once you add an item, in order to adjust quantities you have to go to the list, find the item, press the I icon, increase the quantity and save. I'd like a simple swipe to the right or left on a list item to change quantities.   Ended up paying for the pro version just because I really appreciate this app, and it's the best one I've used. This removes adds and gives you access to scan barcodes. Helpful for really specific items.  Overall, great app and highly recommended. As with anything, there's room for improvement.",

We have one list for food and another for her favorite discount store and one for the home improvement store I like.  I can scan food onto the list via barcode.  I used the last of the ham making a sandwich?  I just scan the bar code before tossing the trash and voila, it's on the list.  My wife can also put things on a \"get on your way home\" list for me to grab on my way home for work.  Aside from that one con, it's a great app. (Kidding about the con there.  I like to eat, too.)",

Nope, you have to reopen the item, then adjust the quantity. If you want to categorize an item your entering in, if the category hasn't already been created, you have to save the item as uncategorized, then create the category, and now go back to the item.to add it to the new category.",

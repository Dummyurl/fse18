IF, AND ONLY IF, you have APPGRATIS installed on your phone AND go through it to download/install this App. The 1 star rating I saw regarding \"trick\" was unjustly deserved and should be ignored. Note: To my knowledge,  this GENEROUS promo is for TODAY ONLY VIA AppGratis! Thank you for your hard work",

If you do more than one type of exercise during a session, which presumably most people do, you need presets since different exercises might have current counts, interval, and rest periods, and it is a terrible hassle having to change the values between exercises each time. The ability to save & reuse presets, preferably with user-customizable titles, will be a great help. NOW SUPPORT PRESETS!",

It appears a lot of work went into programming this app and I really appreciate the effort.  By the way, I have app gratis installed on my phone and the Pro version unlocked as soon as I opened the program. That's the way I like it, a free upgrade to the pro version.",

You have to pay quite a bit more to get a good app for the Pomodoro technique. But iCountTimer is very versatile, you can do much more than just the Pomodoro thing. Kudos for the developer.  JM",

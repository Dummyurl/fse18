It does feel great to stretch my legs every hour or so. There are a few false alarms (once while driving, and yesterday in a supermarket [?!] maybe my watch didn't detect steps while pushing the cart?), but it never got irritating. The best thing that happened to my watch since Bubble Cliuds!",

It will work when you tell it too but seems to vibrate randomly without showing any kind of notification and has no sound option nor does it respond to override apps like Feel the Wear. If you want to control it from your phone you have to install another app that has the potential to over-ride the native 2.0 interface and control.",

Now even able to move time location so it doesn't block the pics. Keep up the great work - love the color/font options! I'm back\ud83d\ude04! Now I've got My Pics, with My Color digital time and font in the Size I want; and date is just as customizable. Having Color options and size choice is a must when using custom photos -and stock only allows b/w which of course didn't work with all photos. With this Custom Watch Face app the digital clock can be tiny so as not ruin a back ground pic or enlarged and moved L/R, U/D. You're the best!",

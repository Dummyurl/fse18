But the number of presses in a short span of time is difficult for users especially in an emergency situation. If I can't make it work right now, how will this thing help me in an emergency crisis? I also think the instructions are flawed.   On the plus side the developers are helpful but they refuse to improve the software for ease of use.   The emergency button is not so discreet. Depending on your emergency situation, especially when your safety is at stake, you sometimes want to be discrete when pressing the emergency button. With the size of the screen of the galaxy s3 and the huge button in the home screen, you can't press the emergency buttons without anyone suspecting.",

I would have rated it a 5, but it seems I must press the power button a minimum of 8 times to make it trigger reliably, regardless of the configured setting of 4  (Galaxy S vibrant). Still a great app though!",

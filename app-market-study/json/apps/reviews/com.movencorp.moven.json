Unfortunately everything on the app work expect for the moven stash section. I cant touch my money. I have to email them to even transfer my money back into my account and still i dont know how long that going to take. I can use the app but not moven stash. Its funny how it was working fine before i put money it. Now im stuck on new years with no money because i have to wait......i dropping them! Dont do it only thing that is good is no fees...other then that...not good customer service...and cant talk to anyone!",

No stores on their site has even heard of Moven and I can never add cash to my card!   Updated: to Moven support. Nope. No ones heard of repower. That's what Ive been trying",

Cons: It is not a really credit bank, you can't get a 2nd card for y ou significant other on the same acxount.  CSR is not helpful pass exoerience of course, You are not going to gain credit. They are more of a savings account business, and location for you to rake money out depend on location, if you take money out off tcf, usbank, wellsfargo or any major banks, you will get charge by the other banks and Moven. 1 out 10, I give it a 5.

Customer service was quick to reply and friendly enough but you can tell that they are just sending automated responses, and after a few back and forth emails they gave up and told me my phone must not be supported (it is). It's a good thing I didn't have an account with them yet or I wouldn't be able to access it or get help to fix it! This review is less on how the app works and more on the service I received which was overall rather poor. I can't imagine having to deal with such poor service when I have real money on the line",

REVISED REVIEW: A MOVEN Manager contacted me ( Emma) who is conscientious..I remember her from originally setting up my account.She activated my MOVEN Paypass so I could at least use it at Starbucks or a location that accepts the swipe technology.Thanks for making it right,and it goes to show you that Management that cares and is hands on can make a difference..  ***NOTE*** I DID REVISE MY REVIEW BACK UPWARDS,I APPRECIATE THE FOLLOW UP,I DID FINALLY RECEIVE MY REPLACEMENT ATM DEBIT CARD.",

Then why on earth don't you make it a paid application in the first place, without the ads and get it over with??? Absolutely horrible way of selling your product. Immediate uninstall.",

        "comment": "I do not have full access to all appfour bundle even though I paid the flat rate for full access.  I was given several instructions that would resolve my issue and none of them worked.  I uninstalled, reinstalled appfour and even went as far as to do a factory reset on my smart watch but nothing worked.  I  finally contacted Trixi, appfour support team member, and was instructed to repurchase the bundle and the repurchase price would be refunded since all their suggestions did not resolve my problem of not have full access.  I sent a response to make sure once I repurchase bundle, the cost would be refunded.  I have yet to receive a reply giving me the green light.  Thi makes me skeptical and maybe they just anted me to charge me twice for the bundle I had already paid for.  I would really appreciate if another support team member would get in contact with me to resolve this issue.",

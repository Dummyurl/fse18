My girlfriend  installed earlier  and ended up uninstalling it as she said it kept closing on her. Nothing  recent in the news corner. Have not tried to created account or log in yet. Clicking trails section the app closes. Clicking the maps takes awhile on wifi to get to the map to do much. Not Intuitive on what to do once therr. Definitely many trails not on map or labeled.

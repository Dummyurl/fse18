Easy to save/convert to txt. This app is LESS complicated than Keep or Evernote. It's PERFECT! Well, okay, it would be nice to have a character count for each note. But really, it's great as it is. And it works beautifully with Android 7 Nougat!",

Just click the Save icon, which appears only when you enter to read that particular note. As at Oct 2017, it is not possible to save numerous texts in one go by highlighting.... After the texts are saved, you can share the entire directory to cloud/card for safekeeping. However importing is easier, you dont need to handle the Notes filed one by one. The settings button has an Import function, you can highlight several text files at one go to import. Although quite troublesome, the advantages of this app is the clean interface, the ability to choose font size and hence line spacing, and an option to auto edit directly. And no annoying ads, no need to pay. I dumped 20 other notepad apps to keep this one, and could accept the primitive backup system.",

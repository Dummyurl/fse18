The interface is easy and everything just works the way it should. I love the fact that the data can be exported to Circuit Tools for analysis later on. The only thing I find lacking is the fact that there is no way of selecting more than one session at a time to export directly to Dropbox or email. Some sort of session backup system to a linked Dropbox account would be welcomed as well. I use Dashware to overlay the data on my onboard videos which makes the videos a lot more exciting. Thanks for a great product!",

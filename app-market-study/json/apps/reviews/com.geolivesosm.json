We will see if there are many requests to continue the development of this Android Wear application (at the moment, we don't have a lot of requests for this Android Wear app). Best regards.",

        "comment": "This app gives access to openstreetmap map worldwide. Unfortunately not opencyclemap which is most useful for cycllists.  No other layers either.   In most respects atlogis apps are better.  The New Zealand one gives nz maps plus open x maps worldwide.  Atlogis gives more flexibility for map downloads.  Sitytrail France is excellent for its IGN maps of Framce.",

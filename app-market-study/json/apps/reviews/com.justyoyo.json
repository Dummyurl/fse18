        "comment": "The app has never failed me at checkout. Usually easier then using another payment service like Android Pay. The rewards are also nice to have considering I am just buying what I would normally buy on Android Pay with no reward.  The User Interface is also really easy to use and understand though sometimes the amount reward points I have can disappear for a little while but this only happens once a month or so and has never been much of an issue.  The only downside to YoYo is that not many company's support the service compared to Android Pay but its not much of a hassle having both app's installed. Other then that I cant complain and love the app!",

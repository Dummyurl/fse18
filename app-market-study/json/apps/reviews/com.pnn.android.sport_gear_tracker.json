Missing: possibility to add text/comments to workout history logs  Works well with Huawei Mate9 and Decathlon chest strap.  I like the DJ feature, but none of my hundreds MP3 have a BPM ID3 tag :-(. Will have to find some computer SW to detect BPM and update my MP3 files.",

The app is simple which is what i want. It would be nice to be able to name specific workouts for better tracking purpose. The interface on the Moto 360 Sport is ugly but who cares as i won't be using it for looks. I'll update to either a 5 or a 0 tomorrow depending on results",

That was disturbing. ;) I was wondering though, I like to log my strength and cardio workouts separately. I tried today but it looks like my cardio is gone. When I tried to start up my cardio I do remember it asking me if I wanted to continue my workout. I said cancel but was able to continue. Did I do something wrong or is there no way to have two separate workouts on the same date? Thank you. :)",

If I restarted the workout on my watch, it happened the same, the first minute it was displaying the correct HR and then after that it starts to drop even though I am still working out. Hope this can be fixed",

I built and configured  the alert, tested it twice and the notification never repeated.  Update: I appreciate the swift reply from Varietas Software.  \"repeating alerts are cancelled as soon you interact with eNotfiy in any way. During your test, please ensure that you close the app and do not touch the status bar or popup notification.\"  During my tests I set up the repeat notification at 1 minute intervals for a specific contact. I then texted myself from the other contact's phone and let the first notification sound, then waited 5 minutes and no reminder fired on either test. I did not have the eNotify app running and did not touch the phone.",

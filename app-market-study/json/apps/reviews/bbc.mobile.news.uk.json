It started years ago when users were forced to place topics into \"my news\" just to be able to see them on the nav bar, and now users can't even see them at all without clicking \"my news\", an additional hurdle. Poor UX design, thought better of the BBC - meant to be a professional service.",

I am unlikely to continue using this version of the app.",

The reason is that where all my favourite topics used to be listed on the top navigation bar, I now have to drill down a few levels in order to find them, and even then it is a case of scrolling through a load of pages rather than being able to go straight where I want. As a result I've largely stopped using the BBC news app.",

That way we licence payers can see all the content when abroad instead of having huge chunks missing. I pay the licence fee and expect to be able to see what I pay for.",

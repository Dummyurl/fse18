I have one very minor complaint. i setup my account to only post to FB when I beat a personal best. Prior to 13 March the post would say I beat \"x\" personal best(s). However, it no longer does that. Now, it only posts that I completed an activity.",

My Moto360's inaccurate heart rate sensor is used on the watch display, when i have a Zephyr HXM connected. I'd rather the watches sensor wasn't switched on in this case.  I'd like to be able to send workouts to other apps, like MyFitnessPal for instance.",

Also connects very quickly to my Polar H7 HRM, which is the main reason I switched to this one, from a competitor :-) I'm using a Samsung S4 with Lollipop. Thanx a lot and keep up the good work! Oh and one more thing - it'd be great if you could subscribe to the Premium version via Google instead of PayPal, which I trust little!",

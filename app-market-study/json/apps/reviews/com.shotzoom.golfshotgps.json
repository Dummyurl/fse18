I have used Golfshot for a good number of years and it has always worked good. However, for some reason it won't allow me to add golfers this year. Once I select the course and select the Tee box I try to add golfers and it will take me out to the list of previous golfers. I select one and make any changes for them, etc. and do the SAVE, then when I return to the setup screen it \u00a0is reset. I have to start over. I do this many times and it does the same thing. I have uninstalled and then reinstalled Golfshot Plus. Also, I can't make changes to my information, such as handicap. When I do it, it seems to take then I Save but when I return to the setup everything is reset. Very frustrating. I wonder if I may have too many golfer listed. I did delete a few previous/recent golfers but didn't help.. FYI I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 that has worked great with your app for a long time.",

Activities can be uploaded to Strava which in turn syncs with Google Fit. So much better than the Strava AW app with support for a whole load of sensors. Keep up the good work!",

I tried a few other apps, some drained the battery, in others it was difficult to choose the activity from the watch itself (needed the phone to do that). But all of this was not a problem with Ghost Racer. I love this app.",

I highly recommend the pro version. You can upload many segments from strava and offline maps. Once you start a ride, everytime you come across a segment, you get a bip alarm and a voice coach is telling you how fast you are against the original ! Only downside is sometimes it can be a ghost that is going on the opposite direction. It would be also great if we could simultaneously compete against many or all the members in the leaderboard. The app could tell what my current ranking in real time is for example.",

Endomondo has that function, but I hate that app. I was so happy when I thought I finally found a better one. But without that function this app is useless to me. \ud83d\ude11",

        "comment": "I installed this app primarily for the AndroidWear 2.0 integration which I'm finding is too buggy for regular use (I have the Moto 360 Sport 2) I wanted something that would work in standalone but the standalone abilities are unreliable. After sending a lot of time setting up Ghosts, syncing to my watch and even testing it to make sure it worked it still failed me when I went on my first run. I have hope for this app and hope the developers know that and won't give up on a true standalone running experience on AW2.0. I'll gladly change my review to 5 Stars if/when the AW experience is improved.",

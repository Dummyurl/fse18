Also would be perfect to see several tasks on the screen (use available space more effectively). Watch: LG Watch Style  UPD Also the app hangs loading tasks from the phone. Sometimes it takes 10 sec, but usually more than a minute.  Impossible to use. As Wear app is critical in my ecosystem, going to unsubscribe from ticktick and move task management to google keep",

Because very sadly, you are greatly missing out market-share in the Wearables-world (yes there is indeed) and likely missing out in mobile to-do lists altogether.  I just could cancel long-time TickTick, and either write my own, or Google Keep (that works okay on watch/every platform), or explore alternatives.  This is serious oversight to ignore timeframe of Dec. 2015 to today, March 2017 of released/purchased watches, and useless Wear app for TickTick.  So what do you say? Need a  Wear developer to untangle this mess?",

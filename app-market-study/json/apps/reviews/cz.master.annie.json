Without that you can only use the app when all devices are connected to same wifi.  On the free version different networks worked really nicely and for free, so I think this is really sneaky Business!",

Whilst the interface works it takes a lot of movement and noise for it to alert you that the animal is awake, so I assume it would be the same with a baby. I had to swing the monitoring camera 90 degrees before it said the dog was awake. I danced in front of it for 30 seconds and it didn't notice a thing! The live stream, however, did work over 4g and the microphone worked well.",

Please fix! I want to use it so badly, and it's super important that it works even when the two devices are in two different WiFi networks (baby device in our own, parent device in our neighbours'). Otherwise I could use my traditional Graco baby monitor and wouldn't need this app at all. Edit: Must have certain ports open in your network for this to work. Wish there was a diagnostics option on android. It works great as long as the needed ports are not blocked, even across networks.",

I personaly use multiple email addresses and phone numbers, but wanted to use the app to track a delicery going to my 90+ year old parents as the driver has been too quick for them when delivering earlier.",

It does this very well with realtime updates, a tracking map once your parcel is out for delivery, an option to add trusted neighbours in case you are out etc...  You can also contact the driver directly to fine tune your delivery.  To those asking why it would ask for multiple emails...  This is so as it can track all your future parcels from whatever store you've signed up to with whichever email.    Otherwise it can only track orders placed with the one email account you provide it.",

Even with a tracking number, it is not possible to add details for a parcel which is not automatically displayed.  My other big gripe is the way that they spell their app name. Not under d for DPD. Not under p for parcels. Not under d for delivery. Not even under m for the frustrating \"my DPD\" clich\u00e9. No, they choose to file the app under y for \"your\" DPD. I'm sure there is an executive out there with only one app on their phone who thinks that this is a good and clever idea.",

What's the point of giving permission to leave in a safe place if it can't be the same day, come on.....in 3 days time it'll then let a late delivery.  Dpd decided to deliver over weekend EARLY so why be punished for it?",

        "comment": "The app could be brilliant but falls short. It tells you it's coming and gives you an hour slot, but only on the day (not say the night before). Second, it doesn't tell you where it's being delivered (I have 2 main locations). Third, it doesn't tell you who the supplier is. Fine, if you are only expecting one delivery around that time, otherwise it's not good enough. I love the options for redelivery though.",

When given your 1 hour time slot on the morning  of your delivery they tend to arrive at the beginning of the slot so delivery is done and dusted. I recommend to all my friends and colleagues. The driver greg is very pleasant and his picture is on the app so you know it's him. Love the app as well always works on my android phone I have used this facility for a long time now. Best delivery service in this country in my opinion. App is brilliant too.",

If you do ur calculation right then at the end of month you will figure out that they just are ripping of customers as they end up paying more than their current service provider. I will switch back to Energy Online as they are not cheaters like Powershop. I thought we will save some money by switching to powershop but for the last 4 months i have ended up paying way more than my previous energy provider.",

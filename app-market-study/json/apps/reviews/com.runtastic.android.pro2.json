The old design was better and wasn't chalk full of adverts peddling users to pay more. The app worked great before. Why ruin something good? Time to look elsewhere",

Then developer starts taking more and more functionality away saying I have to pay more.  That wasn't the deal. So essentially it's theft.  Next you know they'll be wanting your house. Would be a good app otherwise, if it worked how it used to and what I paid for. In short.  Avoid.",

As new amount is recurring payments. Hate this attitude",

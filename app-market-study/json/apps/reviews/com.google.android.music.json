The contextually aware playlist suggestions , genre, activity, mood stations aren't available within the Android Auto version of the app. It's so bare bones that you wind up listening to the same music over and over again. Play Music offers great curated playlists. Please make them accessible to me in Android Auto and I'll be super happy and content. Thank you for your consideration!",

This means a large portion of my monthly data allowance is used to constantly download the same songs when they should not have disappeared in the first place. This has been ongoing so long now that I believe they must have an arrangement with the phone company to make people have to buy more data than they should need to.",

Make it like Spotify with thumbs up on the right/thumbs down on the left.  Don't change things just to be different. Now even three stars is a stretch.",

        "comment": "The app is good overall. After the update I got today to allow to disable album artwork on the lock screen of the phone, I noticed that it also disables the album artwork on the stereo when using Android Auto. I didn't know if it was a glitch at first or not but I tested it out a few times and it does disable it on the screen in the car just like it does on the phone. Was this done intentionally or is that something that could be fixed? I don't want the album artwork to be removed from the car stereo. I thought it would just affect the phones lock screen.",

I can see the album covers on Shuttle+ app and Musixmatch app, but Google play music just shows a blank album art. So, disabling it again after update. 2. Please include a \"play button\" in quick toggles (3D touch).",

You guys took down a number of those albums... My favorite of their albums you took down. This has me looking for another music app subscription. You guys should send out notifications so we can at least download the albums if you're going to take them offline. What's up... I will be leaving play music on the 7th when my subscription expires",

It integrates with Android Auto, which is about the  best thing going for it. There are better apps out there, particularly for those who are listening to their own recordings.",

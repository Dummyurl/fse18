Please do something about it. Otherwise its simple and neat application. Giving 3 star due to this issue only.     Updates (7-Nov-17): I wish it has option for repeat expenses. I need to move to other app due to this missing feature.  Please add repeat expenses feature and improve export and import even if its paid.  Updates (10-Nov-17): Thanks a lot for response. Now i can say its perfect and simple app. Hats off to the team for developing such a useful app that too without any adds.",

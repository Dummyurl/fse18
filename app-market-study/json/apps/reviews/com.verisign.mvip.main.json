My only complaint is they prayer the hell out of you with \"spam\" and no unsubscribe. But that's a different issue. The reason for 3 stars and not 5 is because unlike Google authenticator the Android Wear screen only shows you the main auth for code. If you set up other websites with two factor authentication using this app you can't swipe left on your watch to get the code for the website you are logging into. As such I only use this for one website.",

My steps tracked by my Gear fit 2 pro show up in S Health and MyFitnessPal, both of which are connected to UA record, but the steps don't show in my UA app.  Might try this app again if that bug is fixed. Gonna stop using for now tho.",

It's giving me like a calorie for every 2 steps I take, so I am just sticking with my original calorie goal and ignoring the additional given for steps. Also, when I downloaded the app, it said that with the purchase of the UA Band,  I would be receiving an email with a code to get Myfitnesspal Premium for free. I never received that.",

Would be a solid 5 if everything worked, but with the fact that it dose not sync with the my fitness Pal or show logged calories and only about once a day is the step counter correct with Samsung health app I would really rate it as a 2 star.",

No fixes for the Android Wear app. I've submitted a lot of feedback and have provided bug reports, not many were fixed with the new update sadly. Inching towards a one star.  *Update 12/10/17* Still sucks, high latency and same issues from years ago",

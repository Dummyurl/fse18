App crashes opening settings from android wear app, galaxy note 4.                                                                        Also since this is a paid app can there be an option to remove the text \"wait4it\" from the watchface? Looks wayyyy too cluttered.",

It would be great if you could send the crash report from your phone, since I can't reproduce it on my devices in any way. The app built with libraries updated to the latest versions will be available soon. Hope it's going to resolve your problem.",

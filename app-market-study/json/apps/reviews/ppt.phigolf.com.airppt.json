        "comment": "Been trying to find something that actually works to control PowerPoint from my Android Wear - this does it. There's a companion app for the PC that displays your IP and Port, type the IP in on the phone and away you go. I have not been able to get the gestures to work, but based on the video,  don't think I'd use them anyway because it'd be too awkward.",

        "comment": "I bought this app after a recommendation on Android Police. I would give this app 3.5 stars because the app is in an early development and not everything is optimized. I use a Moto 360 and a Windows 8.1 laptop. What it can do is control the flow of slides from a phone or a Wear watch touch screen. The Wear app (Moto 360 particular) is cropped off from the bottom and I could not successfully  use any gestures. The Windows app is not optimized for high DPI like an ultrabook. Once these things are fixed, this app will well be worth $2.73 for anybody who needs to control a PowerPoint. Plus, it will look super cool.  I think this app, if it can integrate into PowerPoint, should display notes  or be able to control the laser pointer mouse cursor.",

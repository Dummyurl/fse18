No longer shows account/bill along top or linked in app. I tried manually adding my account (it says add account number once and you won't have to again) and it worked but when I exited out and went back in, the account was no longer there. It's easier to pay my monthly bill if it's linked in the app so please sort this ASAP",

That was b4. Suddenly the latest update has stuffed everything up. I have to enter all my details, an email address and a password to look at my account. If i wanted that i wouldnt have a prepay ph, really spark this is stupid and makes me think you...spark.. have other agenda, i dont want ads on my email, i dont want to sign in every time, i wanted a simple prepay and a simple app so i could see my balances etc. Change it back or im going to change companies. Sad.",

No response, so minus 1 star.",

        "comment": "Absolute waste of time. Keeps telling me there is no internet connection when I am sitting 2m away from the modem box. Tried many times to pay for my bill with no luck. Was not informed my bill was due so now I am overdue. Many times the app crashes and many times it tells you there is an error and unable to use app. I swear I spend more time getting frustrated with this app then using it. Only reason I keep app is because it's easy to use to pay my bill but seems I can't do that now. Must be time to uninstall. D-----",

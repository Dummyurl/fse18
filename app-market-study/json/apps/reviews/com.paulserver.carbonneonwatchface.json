        "comment": "*Update 2* Back to my favorite/perfect watch face!  The features that were changed and removed have been added back with this latest update. The developer was very fast and in responding to my email regarding my feedback on the last update. They were very courteous and informative with their plans on addressing mine and other users concerns in the next update. I am very happy to have this watch face back and with added features. Very simplistic and beautiful. I highly recommend this this watch face. I would also recommend emailing the developer if you are having any questions or concerns. They were awesome communicating. :)   *Older Versions* \"Was\" in love this watch face. But now when the watch goes into AOD, It loses any color/stays in only black and white. I have tried rebooting phone, watch, re-syncing from the Android Wear app, Uninstalling from both the phone and watch, clearing cache on both also, and a mix and match of those thing. Still, keep going back to black and white. Asus Zenwatch 3 - Wear 2.0.  *Older Versions* *UPDATE/REPLY\" So the way the AOD on the watch performed before this update was not intentional and was purposely changed? I know that is supposed to be the benefits of AOD on an AMOLED screen, but did you change it because this was a guideline or a requirement? If it was just a base/optimal guideline, would or could you at least leave it how you have it now as Google wishes/but give users who want that option the ability to toggle it on? If not, do you have a repo where I could find the previous version of the Wear app to allow me to revert back? Of course I know this wouldn't be a supported version for you, but I did purchase this app that I loved, then it was half taken away from me without even a warning :(.",

        "comment": "Really like the free version. The Analog looks great. I decided to buy the premium settings and was a little disappointed.( I was really hoping the date had an option to be less long (just include day number) when on analog.)  It also seems before you buy that there are a lot of customization, but there is very little. I really wish there was support for Android 2.0 complications on this. That would make premium more than worth it for $0.99.  I do still REALLY like the watchface and think it is one of the best looking analog faces. I just wish they had invested more time into the premium version.   If this was updated with complications, then I would HIGHLY recommend the premium version. As of now, I'd stick with the free version if you like the analog.",

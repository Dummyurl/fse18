(except for song info) This is the only Wear music controller I know of that will control Maple JB Player which is the best Android music player (Poweramp does not have playback speed control). Took off one star because you have to swipe left to get to the playback controls. I want the playback controls to appear first without swiping left.",

I'm trying to leave my watch in a \"listening mode\", such that I can just say \"play\", \"pause\", \"ok google play\", \"ok google pause\", or some other phrase that allows me to start/pause my music app (google play music in this case).  The mic button kind of works, but I first have to press the mic button and secondly I have to confirm that what I said is indeed what I meant.  Any hints? :)",

However it can be very temperamental, when I try to start my music straight from my watch it will play, but then after 1 or 2 seconds it stops and starts the stock player, i have to press the play/pause button 3 or 4 times to stop it and keep playing music on BlackPlayer. Other than that it works like it used to. It also seems to clash with the built in music control on my wear device? As in I have 2 controls on watch",

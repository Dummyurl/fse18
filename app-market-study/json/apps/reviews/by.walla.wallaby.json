The support people are great and respond very quickly to any updates that are needed or any issues that you have. Contact them to get the problem resolved before rating it poorly! I definitely recommend this app. Its a great way to track the items in your wallet and the various benefits you can get. As I have many credit card to take the best advantage of rewards back programs, Wallaby allows me to find the best card suited to a particular purchase, maximizing my rewards!",

It says my cards are connected to their banks, but still...no new balance and transaction details come through. The new UI is buggy as all hell, and is super ugly compared to what it used to look like.     Somebody clearly pushed this update months before it was ready.  Great product rendered useless as a result.  Edit 1/4/18: Still not working. Even with new phone. I can't edit card details, my credit limits are either 0 or some crazy huge random number. Tried unlinking cards to add them again, now getting a perpetual, \"oops, can't connect to the internet\" error message. Despite zero connectivity issue with any other app.",

It doesn't identify the type of merchant by looking at the card issuer's website; instead I think it just tries to guess what the merchant is by its name. Categories are duplicates (grocery stores and supermarkets are both in the list, but they are the same code for card issuers). Finally, the rotating categories that some cards have by quarter are not updated in the app, so it will suggest you use the card that will not give the most rewards, defeating the purpose of the app completely. I give 2 starts because I believe it can improve in the future.",

If they don't recommend the best card by accounting for the tiered bonus, it makes the app kinda useless! As others said, they have taken a great app and destroyed it with the update. They promised me it would be fixed in a few days, then weeks, and now it's been months... Still no fix. I have stopped using the app so better uninstall to free up space.  ----- Seem to have lost the tiered bonus option feature in the latest version (e.g. for Bofa cash rewards credit card). Throws off all the recommendations! :( Hope they fix it soon for Android too.",

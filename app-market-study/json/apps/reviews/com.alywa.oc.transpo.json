If you have data, it aparently gets even better by giving you all that info right away~ overall, a good app that does what we need it to do~ Only petpeeve is the placement of the add when looking at the stop schedules as it hides the last one of the day.... which is kinda important when you think you missed the last but you didnt? And actually miss it because of it? ****needs to be fixed please and thank you :)",

Original review: I like the look of the new update, but it is not working very well with me. Pretty much anything I try to do, I get an error saying \"Oops, Unable to query data source\". I tried using both Wifi and Data and nothing seems to work. I even tried reinstalling the app and still nothing.   It used to be great before this update, and I hope the problem can be solved.",

I like how you can actually see where your bus is on the map, but again I doubt its accuracy. The app itself is clunky and doesn't have a good flow to it. I often find my self scrambling through the options and menu trying to see if I made it to the bus stop on time to catch my bus, or was I supposed to take the bus that's now pulling away as a back up... It can be very annoying that you can't actually do any trip planning with the app, there's no travel planner like on the OC Transpo site, nor can you see future bus times, to do it the old fashioned way.  It's been over 5 years since I had to last use this app and the busses in Ottawa for that matter, and I'm saddened to see the app hasn't changed at all.",

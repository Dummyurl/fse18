The only thing is that the android notification bar on top of my Galaxy Note 4 doesn't vanish when using the app and therefore partially blocks some of the image. I'll gladly give 5 stars once this issue is resolved. (Also it'd be SUPER awesome if you could 'fit to width' and  have the option to scroll down for images that have a very large height compared to their width!).",

        "comment": "This app is really great. But I would rate it 5 stars if few minor features were added. Firstly, a width-fit support with Scrollable view is needed. Its of immense use for all Interface designers out there.  Secondly, when using artboards, the app displays all the artboards together,.. Instead of doing this, the app could display only those artboards which are active in Photoshop. This is another thing that will help people working in the latest PS CC versions alot.",

Also, the activity resets when rotating the device 90\u00b0 (180\u00b0 works fine). Not sure if this is intended.  Hope to see those features launch soon!",

But there is a big bug that when you want to enter ip to connect to photoshop, a numeral keyboard will be show and unfortunately there is not any Dot key to enter the ip correct! You can only enter numbers! You should copy and paste your ip here! Also it is very good if you make it scroll support. Big thanks \ud83d\ude0a",

To fix this issue you can swap it with day and date ( upside down ) or its not fit for purpose. So here is the problem and solution.",

With this watch face as well as the slick watch itself it's really a head turner. The watch face never lags and the information is always correct, unless it is disconnected from your phone then your phones battery information is not correct and the date can get a little off.. -SirO Reviews (reviewed on: LG-G Watch R) if you found this helpful, please thumb up this review",

Also a change of the hands color should be nice including a second hand. Just a question about burn-in protection. I see no pixel shifting to prevent burn-in. Developer please reply :-)",

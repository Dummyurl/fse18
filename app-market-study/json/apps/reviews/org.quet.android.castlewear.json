Now I'm upset I can't give it a sixth star. Keep up the great work you're developing an amazing game.",

Impressive how you could make a real game fit on such a small screen!Would love to see some sort of zoom function for the phone so it occupies whole screen or maybe have it display the map on screen. Speaking of map would be great to be able to move while in map mode! Edit: a big thank you for lowering difficulty! Ty for bug fixing so much to explore",

Yeah no. That's an awful idea. Ive seen it before, it literally makes no sense.",

On the 4th floor, I could no longer access the elevator I had been riding, but there was a second elevator nearby. However, this elevator seems to be broken. It doesn' have buttons like the first one, and nothing happens when I swipe to the right. Also, I can't get to stairs from where I'm at, and I can't find any hidden doors. Why did the first elevator disappear??",

After the updates thte touch controls are working perfectly and the resolution is a lot better. Keep up the good work, can't wait to see what else is added.",

The menus are a bit slow to respond but I'm sure that will be better over time.   One recommendation I have is to make it a bit 'lighter' It took me over 5 mins to set up a new character and get into the dungeon. Which itself might be my entire commute.   Once I was in I really started enjoying it. But yeah, maybe a ''lighter' introduction, perhaps pre set characters/groups or a more streamlined 'new game' process. It'll assist new users who are simply wanting to kill a short amount of time :)",

For the E string on the violin it was okay, and the A string on violin and viola the same, but for any lower notes it didn't work, and it didn't work at all for the mandolin! The G strings on all instruments are picked up as D.",

The UI is absolutely spot on, but that doesn't count for anything if the app doesn't serve its purpose. (Samsung galaxy s6, guitar. Don't blame the poor functionality on the microphone, other tuning apps such as 'guitar tuna' work fine)",

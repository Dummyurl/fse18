Unis tallied and reinstalled, still nothing. Tried everything several times, then emailed the developer from the info on this page, to get a reply saying the sensor isn't an official product please ring customer services. I'm now angry. Have possibly lost all previous data and can't see what I've got on the sensor and getting messed about with support! Really not acceptable for a company like Sony and a sensor costing so much money!",

        "comment": "Overall good design, large fonts and UI as it should be.  Orientation is killing me: everything is in portait except for the live mode video which is a pain when using a stand (and even with portrait or landscape, it should rotate 180deg if the devices is oriented that way).  My biggest gripe is that there seems to be no ability to explicitly start/stop a \"session\" to split out different parts of trainings or different players (the zooming feature does compensate for the lack of this feature).  Another obvious but worth mentioning limitation is that it will count all your shots, including shots hit in the net (serves for instance) or balls out by 2 meters. This is why the live video mode is so useful, assuming you place the camera/tablet behind the player to see where the ball is going.  I don't like the requirement for users to create a Sony account before they can use the app/device. It should be opt-in assuming people want to backup or share.  At the end of the day this collects great data, offers great UI but you'll have to be able to interpret the data or get help from a pro to really improve your game.",

Slow motion has issues, but if you add a tag to a video using a smart watch (in my case a Moto 360) you will be able to use slow motion. No tag? Slow motion returns to beginning and can't be advanced. Ability to share video and detailed stats missing - sharing with a coach would be great.

One way to fix this in the app is the prep for the serve (i.e. detect waiting in one place for the serve, less moving, better tracking). To conserve some power do the analysis in the app not in the sensor firmware.",

        "comment": "After a tennis clinic Wednesday, (the 1st time I used this) I note that it should be no surprise that they are sailing long and not working too well. I am essentially hitting the ball totally flat (well, +1). My forehand is more in the +6 ball rotation range.  So, next time I play I'll know I am not actually brushing up on the ball nearly as much as I assumed I was.  Cool.  Faults: (ha, tennis puns): (1) it cannot tell the difference between overheads and serves. In a USTA doubles match (6-4 6-3) I had four service games. According to the sensor, I had 2 serves, and 44 overheads. Next match 1 serve, 39 overhead smashes.  (2) I also wish the data could be shunted to a pc, rather than my phone. Best I can do is e-mail myself screenshots from my phone if I want to see it (3) You can only have one playing session per day. If you play in the morning and evening on the same day, you get one 12 hour playing session, with the data merged.  I am not crazy about the bright orange color, but given the number of times I've seen people wandering around looking for vibration dampener'sI can see the sense of being able to find a $200 gizmo if it falls off.",

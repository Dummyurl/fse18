Only feature that seems missing is ability to include a long break option (for lunch).  You have to pay for the ability to adjust the work/break duration settings, but it is worth it and helps support a developer who has long contributed to the Android development community. One issue, which I'll email developer about, is with the update I get reminders on my watch every minute, unless I deactivate the sync.",

It would also be good if we could start the break before the work. Probably not too great for motivation but there could be reasons. And an early break (to eat or so on) is not too unreasonable.",

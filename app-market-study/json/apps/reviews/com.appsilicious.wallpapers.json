        "comment": "It's very good as a wallpaper app. But the app has now started playing ads with sound inside the app. This is very irritating and annoying - and frankly intrusive when I am in a quiet environment. If you play a video with sound, give controls to mute it. Even better, start muted, with option to switch on sound. If you don't change this soon, I will uninstall the app, sorry. The value you add is not worth the intrusion into my personal space.",

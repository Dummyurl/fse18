But that is not the case in Keeper. The O looks like the slimmer 0. I nearly locked myself out of an account where I had used Keeper's random password generator, which had selected an O as one of the characters. Finally realized the problem after copying and pasting the password into Gmail to get a better look at it. This app should allow you to change fonts..........

I might need to make a new shorter password, but that lowers my security. UPDATE: I took off another 2 stars because they promised thumbprint authentication, but its nowhere in the documentation.

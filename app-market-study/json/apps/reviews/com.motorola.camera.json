        "comment": "I'd like to see the app add an option to save pics & video to external SD card.  But otherwise, the interface of this camera app is by far my favorite of any camera app.  So very quick & easy to use.  I love that I can click just one button and video instantly starts recording.  Versus other apps that require at least two button clicks and sometimes more.  Minus one star for no external SD option.  I mean come on, newer SD cards are blazingly fast, so it should totally be a user option.  And so far, I have not found an Xposed module that works with this camera app to save pics to external SD.",

However I am kinda sad I cannot change settings to polarize or do black and white, maybe even do some effects on it. It's my only disappointment on it. But I love the focus on it so much. I've got this pic at the tulip festival of a bee and you can see the pollen on his legs.",

Storage location must be customized, not only \"Phone\" and \"SD Card\". It should give more specific option to save the pictures. 4. Auto Flash is not working every time. 5. Quick capture is not working. (Not sure if this problem is happening in my phone only)  It was far better before the update. MOTOROLA please get these issues fixed. I really liked the Camera features and the picture quality when I bought this phone.",

So that eats up my hard drive really quick. Same with pics.  Each one is 3-4MB. It'd be great to have the option to lower the quality from 1080p recording to 720p or something smaller. Don't need the best quality all the time. Besides that its pretty good",

Well it is dead simple to use. And a nice one. But it didn't bring up anything special. More to it reminds me of my first phone Moto v360 and Nokia 6600 late in 2005-06. But I strongly feel there should be a full set of manual controls in this camera. It will surely make it the best camera phone. I can bet on it. And hope to see this in coming updates.",

Sometimes, i noticed that i was not at all able to see what i am capturing when i suddenly enter from dark room to sunlight. So, screen should be at full brightness when app is open.

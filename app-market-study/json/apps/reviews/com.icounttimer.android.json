I had hoped the presets allowed a day of week and a set of exercises. Just program click start on the day and the timer would show the next activity and announce. No luck.  Presets are not useful.  Only worth buying just for the higher interval options. May still ask for refund and try another app. Love the timer graphics and sequences though.",

        "comment": "For me, it seems more logical to count every rep with the voice. If i set it to 4 counts(reps) i would like to hear 1, 2, 3, 4. or perhaps Start/Go, 2,3,4. so the start is not confused with the count down. As it is now, it seems that it doesn't count the last count/rep when i set it to 4 and all i hear is Start, 1, 2, 3.. Some people perhaps like it this way tho, so perhaps a toggle to use start as 1 and go directly to 2?  Other than that, it's pretty great :)",

It needs to auto-refresh.  Also, it needs the option of turning off the birthday calendar.  ** I changed this from 3 to 4-stars because the developer is very responsive to email. We just had an email conversation less than five minutes after I posted my review. :)",

Maybe you can trim it down? 2. colors deviate from google scheme, which is ok, but kind of off-putting when most wear apps follow a similar color palate. 3. event names are truncated too short in main screen making it almost useless and have to swipe to the left one more time to see what your events are.",

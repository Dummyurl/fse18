The only problem that I have, and that is the reason why I don't give it 5 stars, is because the Transparency option doesn't work on my LG Urbane 2. It makes my screen glow when is locked, and it's not transparent. I can't see my watchface behind the lock screen.  Otherwise it's a great app. I believe that this is functionality that should be part of Android Wear.",

I would suggest one thing tho, make an invisible lock screen, so I can see the time better when just touching the screen, that would be even better! (Same as the \"Swipe\" lock, but without the dots and lock icon)",

So what I really want is to be able to see the watch face at all times, just for it NOT to be active.   This almost works, but not reliably.  The transparency feature worked once, but then stopped after I played with config.  When the watch is idle, the screen is grey.  When the watch is active, the screen is also grey.  I'd like to be able to check the time without unlocking the watch.   (I'm using the swipe to unlock method, so I should have no trouble reading the clock under the lock symbol, if only it were transparent.)  Another minor quibble is that the swipe screen appears to be drawn for square faces.  On round faces, it shows as a black box surrounded by grey.    Please improve, as you're on the right track!  Will adjust my review accordingly.  Thanks!",

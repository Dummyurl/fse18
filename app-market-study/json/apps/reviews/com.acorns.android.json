        "comment": "Extremely easy to use for someone who is interested in saving for the future by investing, but doesn't really know where to start. Roundups has been very helpful getting me to see a little can add up to a lot in a small amount of time. I tested withdrawals and the money was in my account in the amount of days promised. I like that the money is not as easy to withdraw as the money in my regular savings because I am not as tempted to use for little purchases, that I really don't need. I plan on reinvesting the money I withdrew back into Acorns now I know the withdrawal worked as promised. I like the versatility of one-time, automatic or roundup \u00d71 \u00d72, just change or round 1.00 up as well and that I can change settings anytime I want. If things are going good, slow, bonus at work etc...So far I like just about everything and I have read some amazing tips on here that I may not have stumbled upon elsewhere. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.",

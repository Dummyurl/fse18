It could not connect to the dedicated port. Now it is ok.  (Samsung Galaxy S6) If I use my mobile net, the cam keeps on loading and it never loads. Is it possible to maintain? I've been using this app for many years and it always worked both on wifi and mobile net. :)",

It uses its own internal movement detection and emails pics of the videos it records. I have a mix of makes and models of cameras and it has good drivers for all of them. My only trouble at the moment I'd that it won't write the video clips to the SD card or other external memory, only the internal memory of the android device. I'm using android v6",

Shame really, because otherwise it could be a decent app. Update: 12/29/17. Still no UI improvement over the past few years.  Removing another star.",

The only bad thing is wifi. It is slow as anything ever seen on wifi. If need to turn a light on/off it is much much much faster to turn wifi off on phone and use 4G. Having the phone on wifi and trying to do so is maddening. Notifications seem faster than trying to turn light off/on. But haven't timed it recently so can't say for sure. Except for the wifi, really like it. Fix the wifi slowness and get another star. Oh, forgot the Home Sitter Service. Don't really like cause if go to bed early it might turn a light on waking me up. You don't get an option to not turn something on after a certain time.",

Special thanks to the great people of this world who would rather point the finger via a lawsuit than accept blame that they themselves actually messed something up.     The location feature for leaving an area works so well at locking my door, and August - using only Bluetooth to auto unlock my door - typically leaves me standing at my door like an awkward nut for 30 seconds waiting for it to connect.  Auto unlock via this app would make the process that much better.  Everything about this Wink app is otherwise wonderful.  You have done an amazing job integrating multiple aspects of a smart home that are even useful before you have a large group of smart products.  1 or 2 things is all you need for this app to become a necessity!",

Why is the actual Wink app so ****in slow?! They seem to be totally incapable of fixing this, as it's been this way forever.",

Apparently this has been a known issue for quite some time but no solution has been implemented.    7/25/17  Wink has grown a lot and has become more reliable with time. I'd love to have more icon choices for devices.",

Devices that are zigbee and zwave should be instant from the wink hub 2. Doesn't work with the latest version of Chamberlain myq controller. robots need more logic, currently things are too simple. There needs to be a way to set up IFTTT service, what is currently offered doesnt allow the hub to be an If trigher",

I have had the same 5 shortcuts(living room lights on, sitting room lights on, all lights off, door lock, door unlock) on my home screen for well over a year with no problems. Now, with the latest update, all of the shortcuts have changed themselves to be \"door unlock\" widgets. They still show the correct icon for the shortcut that's supposed to be in that spot. However they all say \"door unlock\" underneath and unlock the door when pressed. I reset them all to the correct shortcuts twice and they turn themselves back into \"door unlock\" within 2 days.",

I don't know if that's a Android or Wink issue. The app is also slower than it was on my iPhone, I've had a similar experience to other reviewers with the slow spinning circle. I'm running Android 7. Otherwise, I don't regret having Wink, it's 1000 times better than ADT pulse!",

App does not always sync properly with hub and does not 100% recognise the on/off status of lights. Home sitter service appears to be broken, only allowing two lights to be included. Robots could use an improved logic and multiple triggers. Compatibility with devices - especialy zwave - is quite limitted.",

It really is utterly useless as an app to actually turn things on and off, or dim things, etc.  It's much easier to just use Alexa or Google Assistant.

        "comment": "Update: Thanks for adding suggestions, now the best calc app in my opinion.... This a very good, simple calculator. It is the one I would use. But without a decimal point it is not useful. Lots of potential, Please add decimal point. My suggestion is tap on display to delete a digit, hold on the display to delete all. Then the clear button could be changed to a decimal button.",

If theres a update to reduce information on the screen for P-OLED screen that would be great",

I've purchased about half of your designs... Keep 'em coming but please fix the weather - add more providers - it is still reporting incorrectly! Could it be a timezone issue? Please look into this... I sent you enough detail via email. Can't believe the lack of reply or consideration on this topic.",

        "comment": "This is a great watch face, but they only did half the job: there is no ambient mode face at all. Designed for AMOLED watches, this makes the face all but useless. If the power drain doesn't get you, burn-in will eventually. That's why every other watch face on the market has a low power, B&W (mostly black) ambient mode, not just a brightness adjustment for the full color face. Very disappointing, considering how nice a design it is. Also, it writes G Watch R on the face; should be huawei.",

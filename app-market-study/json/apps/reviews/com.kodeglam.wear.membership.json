I also use Quickbar app but this one loads and operates much smoother. For new cards, having to enter the barcode number rather than loading photo or scanning is not that much of a big deal.",

Great for going to the gym especially. I used to carry my smartphone in to the gym so I could scan in. Now I can just scan with my watch, listen to my Bluetooth music, and get phone calls leaving my phone behind. People usually balk their eyes in amazement just because I scan things with the watch. Mostly because they can't believe it's not an Apple Watch. For the millionth time... nooo... it's not an Apple Watch!  \ud83c\udf4f\u231a\ud83d\ude0e",

Would also be better if it included a way to re-order the cards. Right now the only way is to delete all your cards and re-enter them in the order you want. Option to take a picture of a barcode would be awesome too. Overall, though, well done!",

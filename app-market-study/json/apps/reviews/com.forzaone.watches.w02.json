        "comment": "It works well. It is an attractive watch face. But..  - Area is not properly used in rectangular watches like Sony SW3. The design leaves lots of empty space. The watch area should be used efficiently.  - Date format should allow mmm d, yyyy, i.e. Nov 7, 2017 - AM/PM indicator should be placed at the right of the seconds. - The colon : between the hour and the minutes should be vertically centered. - The leading zero cannot be removed. It doesn't make sense for 12-hour format.  - The format label 12 or 24 hour cannot be removed.  Please, provide these modifications in the settings and you'll be providing the watch face of the century. There will not be enough stars to rate it.  Cheers.",

The only problem I am having, it's the weather update does not update for a whole day until the next day. Instead of offering tech support, the developer should provide an update or the air on how to fix this issue. Maybe adding more options like updating every 1, 5 10, 22, etc. hours on the phone app as a setting. Also adding more weather providers, like AccuWeather, Yahoo weather, etc. To be more accurate.",

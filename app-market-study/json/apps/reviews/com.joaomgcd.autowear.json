This one in particular seems more like a \"private alpha\" than an app you would actually charge money for. The UI is very technical and essentially unusable without constantly referring to the \"manual\". For example: When creating a new notification, there is an input box labelled \"Command\". What do you think that covers? Is it a command that is sent to the watch? No. It is in fact used to specify a trigger event, i.e when this happens on your watch, the AutoWear action that you are currently configuring will be executed \u2013 independent of Tasker. In other words, \"Command\" can be \"the screen turns on\". In Tasker, this would be a \"(trigger) Event\" or profile \"condition\".",

Hooking your watch into the power of Tasker makes it nearly as powerful as your phone, and being able to make layouts and screens that use HTML formatting trivially? Takes things to a whole new level. I've made so many things with this app, it's ridiculous. Main one was a cohesive control panel for Tasker, which was revolutionary for me. Seriously, wow. Bravo Joao.",

        "comment": "Really good for working collaboratively on projects. For more  personal use it would be great if you could move the cards on the page that collates all your cards from different boards into an order you plan to do them (without faffing about with putting a due date on them that is liable to change). Even better would be if you could move the cards around in a quadrant: bottom left = easy, not important, top left = easy, important, top right = difficult, important, bottom right normally = difficult, not important, but I list my personal to-dos in here eg buy birthday pressie, wash car, book hair etc! Hope you might consider this functionality - would make my life complete! \ud83d\ude09 But great work so far! \ud83d\ude0a. Thanks!",

Few suggestions I would like to make though to the developers:  1. It would be awesome to have a search option inside a card in the Android app to search for words  2. The reminder could be more effective by letting users set reminders separately for every individual item on a card.",

It helps us to make sure we keep inventory accurate and don't run out of things and keep up on what needs to be fixed in each store and helps us make the schedule for when employees need to come into work. Don't know what we would do without it.",

Easy simple powerful with powerups. Guys don't sell your company like wunderlist. You have done very good job. If I go build up my business I will totally use Trello to track my business.",

        "comment": "I love the idea but the reminder implementation is a deal breaker for me. The notification always fires 24hrs before it's due. I'm a fan for putting a reminder on something for when I want to be reminded. If I want one 24hrs early or more than I'd set an extra reminder or two. So for me it's not good. Love the general design otherwise.",

Since I've been using it I'm 5 times more organised. Great drag and drop action to organise lists and attach documents. I've seen far worse apps and programs charging exorbitant monthly subscriptions. Brilliant app just try it!",

It seems like you mainly consider people using Trello in a team, but loads of people use it to organise their daily lives as well.",

The tool doesn't try to force life into  neat little separate boxes and static lists. But the interface allows you to organize your thoughts and focus so you aren't overwhelmed. The developers are working from reality instead of an oversimplification of life.",

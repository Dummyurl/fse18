        "comment": "Unfortunately the watchface is too difficult to see. On paper it looks good, possibly even on an emulator but in a real life scenario, on my Lg G Watch Urbane it did not look really good. Sorry guys, I know its meant to be \"Contrast\" but some more luminance is needed. Ambient mode is too simple as well.",

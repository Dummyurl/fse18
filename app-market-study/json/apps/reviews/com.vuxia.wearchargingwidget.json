        "comment": "My watch (LG Urbane LTE 2nd Edition) already has a charging app that could serve a similar purpose to this app, but it was way too bright for use at night, and it would shut down once the watch was fully charged. Developer options provides a way around the second problem, but not the first. Enter this app. Works almost flawlessly for me. Displays the time and charge status, but keeps it dim enough not to keep me awake, and stays on until I unplug the charger.  The only minor issues I've seen relate to the interaction with the built-in charging app:  1. Sometime (I haven't been able to see a pattern yet) the built-in app comes up instead of this one, but a simple swipe on the screen allows me to move back and forth between each. Slightly annoying, but not a deal-breaker  2. Because the built-in app turns on auto-rotate, I need  to ignore the rotate features of this app, and always keep it set to unrotated. Again, not a problem, just took me a few minutes to figure out why the rotation wasn't working the way I expected.   All in all, just what I was looking for. If the interactions with the built-in charging app could be fixed, it would definitely rate a 5-star review",

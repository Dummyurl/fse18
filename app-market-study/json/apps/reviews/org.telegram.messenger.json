It's affected by average/weak signal strength on mobile data/WiFi and as a result messages don't go through. I think it should be able to function irrespective of strength of any connection.",

This happens with me and my friends who all also have android (Samsung 8s) so don't know if this is an android problem or not but it needs to be fixed before we find an alternative. We are all tired of thinking everyone is ignoring each other when it's just telegram being a dick. Update, notifications still not working",

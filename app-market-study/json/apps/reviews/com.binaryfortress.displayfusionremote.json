In that context it works flawlessly, with plenty of gravy functions on the side. My only thought on how this app could be improved, would be to add a widget where we could place the most used  functions for quick and easy access, but that is certainly not enough to dock a star. :)",

        "comment": "Only thing that is very useful about this app is the ability to run custom scripts. So if you can program (C# cause VB is trash lol) then you can make great use of this. The only custom scripts that I've used is to shutdown my PC, make it sleep or troll friends with random messages on the screen lol. If i ever need it do something else, i love the ability to add it myself. To the average user, it's not entirely useful. In theory though, this app can virtually do anything so for that I'll give 4 stars.",

Also using it for locking my windows+ putting my monitors to sleep, really awesome (it's one of the custom scripts that you can download in the desktop DIsplayFusion). Only bad thing is that I am using it on my smartwatch too (Sony Smartwatch 3) and I have one problem. Whenever I open the app from the smartwatch it asks me to open the program on mobile phone first.. Which is kinda redundant because if I am already on my phone, in the DisplayFusion app, I don't need to use my watch anymore. Could you please look into it? I would really love to just touch my smartwatch and be able to sleep monitors quickly. Thanks a lot and keep up the great work!",

I can mess with settings, enable/disable stuff, but honestly... why do it from my phone/tablet? I have to be able to see the PC anyway to do any of this, I'll just sit down and do it if I really really need to change any of the settings. Don't waste your time, it's not a view/control the computer remotely type of remote. It's like a TV remote with all the good buttons gouged out by your baby brother. Better to just walk up to your TV or get a different remote.",

When your playing a game and or watching you tube, using a chat program or whatever else you do with your other monitor it's nice to be able to open this app and use the endless options that it has without disturbing the programs your running.  I am giving this app 5 stars because it's nice to have the options that this app has even if I may not ever use one or two of the options. Its still nice to have every option when I want it.   Well done to the person or persons that made this app. Thank you for giving me all the greatness this app has to offer.",

You have to turn on the function by checking the box and click on Apply. Then, on your phone, hit refresh and it will find the desktop and ask for the security code which is listed just below the checkbox. Fill that in and bam! you are in business.  There are tons of things you can do but I'm distracted by pretty pix right now.",

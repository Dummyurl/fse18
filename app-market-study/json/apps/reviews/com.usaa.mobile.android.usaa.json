Since then, it feels less like an app and more like a web portal where the rules are made up, none of the buttons do anything, and you're counting some of my bills twice and some of my bills never. It's not too complicated if I could do a better job of this with a single calendar sheet. And let me at least attempt to use and edit this on the real website.",

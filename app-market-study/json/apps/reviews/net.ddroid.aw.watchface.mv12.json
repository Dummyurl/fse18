        "comment": "So ambient mode is more of a strobe light feature as my screen flashes tons of times before registering any input, and after changing the display option to always on in the watch settings app, it never goes into ambient and just drains my battery. No option for current weather is a deal breaker. Knowing what the weather is going to be later is useful. But not as useful without current weather. Hope to see an update fixing these issues. Will downgrade to 1 star if no fix comes as the face seems bugged.",

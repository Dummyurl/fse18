So it puts us at ease a bit. And it's shows where your exact location. This is also perfect if you have kids who have their own phone and you want to keep track of where they are are going.",

It leaves a icon to \"tap to view Glympse  history\" that shows nothing but the user's last location when the Glympse expired (ex. parked in the drive way).  It needs to leave the user's full PATH during the course of the Glympse session.  A 'history' showing where they finally stopped after hours of traveling is useless.",

It would be nice if it was possible to select multiple contacts and send out the exact same link to all of them at once. Also, please stop asking me to rate the app... I already have twice now! Over all, this is a must have app!",

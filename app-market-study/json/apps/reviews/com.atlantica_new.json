        "comment": "It appears support for Samsung is limited to only \"Gear live\".  I rated this face set on merely device support. If your device support is updated, I can then experience this face set and raise stars accordingly. I have a Samsung Gear S 2, currently are there plans of updating? I would really like the opportunity to try this face set out. Thank you for your time.    Regards,    Daniel R. Sullivan",

At first I thought it didn't have one Anyone knows the hour hand is at the bottom, then the minute hand and last, on top the second hand. This is back to front and looks stupid. Put it right and its 5*instead of laughable. I'll stick with my pixel Perfect B&R1 I made. Google needs to make Them show the real face. Not mockups and photoshop.This lot use 3d print",

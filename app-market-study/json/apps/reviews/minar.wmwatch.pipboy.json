I enjoy constantly changing its functions and adapting it to what I need (and Watchmaker really allows me to do that, but it took some getting used to). My only criticism is that on my watch the more advanced of the watchfaces included does not really work that well (lags constantly and drains my battery), but that is obviously due to my hardware limitations. Still, it would be nice to have a lighter version of that watchface as well.",

Pop for the $4-5 for both this application, AND WATCHMAKER PREMIUM, or it simply will not work.  Instructions, instructions, instructions. Great job, devs! Edit: For those of you who have battery issues, give your devices time for the software to settle in. I found that many wear applications work smoother over time, especially larger or interactive application functions.",

More if it's used for text messages and stuff. It would be awesome as a stand alone without watchmaker, but I have no clue how to make an watchface so I have no idea how hard it is. Over all its a great app. I just wish I could use the full capabilities of it.",

Your watchface is a great  companion to my phone as I have a Red Fallout theme right now. Looking forward to any future updates ..... oh and people......read the instructions! p.s. .... maybe down the line a version that lets you launch an app on the phone via an additional Pip-boy section on your watchface.... say the Fallout Pip-boy app when your playing Fallout.... just a thought.",

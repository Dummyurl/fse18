Only minor glitch is putting in hole by hole score ..... when you get to hole 18 it doesn't tab down to the putt tab automatically so you accidently put the number of putts on the hole for your score.  Seems would be an easy fix.  All in all its a keeper.  Definately hope the little putt score situation on hole 18 is fixed soon......also interested in further comlplex fun adjunct development.",

For the first year I loved it and got several of my golf buddies on the same app. It automatically renewed on June 7, 2016, but, since that time I have not been able to access the app to upload new scores or even view the app to transfer my data. When I try to click it on, it says that my membership has expired; when I click on purchase membership I get an error message that says \"You're already subscribed to one year subscription\". Then I click OK and it says that PlayStore reported a cancelled purchase (which I did not do) . When I go to PlayStore it says I am paid up until June 7, 2017.??? I have reached out to the vendor and to Google for help. I have not had a response from either. If this cannot be fixed I would NOT recommend this app because I have now  lost a year's worth of scores and am now starting all over. Very frustrating!!",

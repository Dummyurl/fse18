IF you don't have to do that....then HOW DO you get new RSS feeds into the phone to send to the wearable?    I don't see any \"help\" button on this app.   I'm willing to pay for this, but right now I don't see it's usefulness.  All I can get is the 3 sample feeds.    Surely... surely, you've made it easier than this.  I'm looking for the \"grab RSS  feeds button' so I can go to a site and grab the URL",

No problem adding feeds, since I actually looked at the name of the app I was downloading & realized that I would need sites' RSS feeds, instead of installing without reading anything and rating 1 star because I'm a doofus who downloads RSS readers without knowing what a RSS is, makes no attempt to learn by looking @ the help tab or Googling it, and instead gets mad that the RSS reader won't let me add regular non-RSS URL's (Yeah I'm looking at you, Bill)",

Update: would like to see ability to read the entire feed on the watch (perhaps phone app setting)  or at least the ability to open the feed from the watch, on the phone with your Internet browser/rss reader. Yes, I know it was only intended for headlines, but still I would like this feature.",

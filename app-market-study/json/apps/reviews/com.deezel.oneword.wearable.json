This is a very good job, may God grant you the grace even to do more to His Glory.....     This a good app, well there is something missing in the book of John, there are missing scriptures, like in the book of John 3:, John 4, all  need to be updated , because they are ending on the 21st Verse but in the actual sense, they go beyond.",

Try uninstalling & reinstalling the app. Once you re install give the watch minute or 2 before running the app. It takes a minute to copy the application to the watch. Then run app on watch. Allow another minute or so to install. Since this works independent of phone it has to copy the entire bible to the watch.",

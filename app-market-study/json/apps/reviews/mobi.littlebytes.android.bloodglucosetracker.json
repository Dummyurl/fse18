So, while you can enter and check blood pressure for example, you cannot print it it and show it to your doctor. Also there is no export to CSV file or something like that. With a little more effort this could become a truly great app.",

I used to think \"well, that number is ok\". But I now know that it isn't. So I know when and what to change so that I'm doing better. This app also let's me track my A1C. I couldn't do that on my other app. Plus an added perk, I can monitor my food intake. I couldn't do that before either. Now I can look at my diet and micro manage it. And that's not all. And there are other great uses. I guess what I'm really saying is I love this app",

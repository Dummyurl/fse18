The rounds go by prety fast because if you do not get the hang of it you might never get a good high score. But here is a hint of getting a good high score go fast. If your high score is 50 or up you got a good high score. But be careful it could make you die when the platform changes. It only changes when you pass 50. So it changes from 50 to 100 to 150 to 200 and so on you get it. It is so much f",

And I haven't played enough to see if I like it. But the adds really makes me not want to find out. The adds really destroys any enjoyment of the game or to get into it at all. I know the developer has to make money. As I said I buy 95% of my games. But if the ads make to Uninstaller before you want to buy it. What's the point!",

These 2 colour really is a pain and also unfairly unlucky to those who gets it all of a sudden. This issue needs to be fix",

And I'm getting sick and tired of these advertisements because they slow down the game, the game will stop for 5 seconds and continue and I fall off because it stopped, and TOO MUCH LAG!!!! I will uninstall this game until you get rid of the advertisements. I am never paying to get rid of advertisements, because I could be doing something better with the money instead of waste it to get rid of advertisements.",

It was super smooth and didn't lag at all on iPhones, but both of my LG devices don't like this game at all. it is smooth for about 10 seconds, then starts to slow down. The game goes into a laggy slomo version of the game and switches between this and running smoothly. I have an LG G4 and an LG Gpad 8.3",

It has the perfect amount of difficulty, and it also has brilliant graphics, even better than HD! I would definitely recommend it! Well done, Ketchapp! However, I have one tiny problem. I'll be playing, about to get my high score, and then an ad will come up and stop the whole game. When I click no to the ad, I don't have enough time to recover and get back into the game, and I'll die! Please make it so that any ads come before or after a game is played!",

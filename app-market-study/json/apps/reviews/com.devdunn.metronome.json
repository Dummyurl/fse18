It works very well, and I find it especially nice that it doesn't require any stupid permissions. The only issue I've found is the notification doesn't work as intended, but that's a rather small issue. Good job!",

That said, it's missing a lot before it can call itself really good. There are no options for time signatures outside of \"X/4\". You can put whatever value you want in X and for BPM -- this should translate to the lower time signature value, as well. Also, the \"instrument sounds\" are just different pitched electronic beats. That bummed me out. :(",

Many phones do not have a menu button these days.",

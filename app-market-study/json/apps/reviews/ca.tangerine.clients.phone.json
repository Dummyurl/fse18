And it won't even open if I use data. \"No connection\" message over and over and over and over.... VERY frustrating.",

Lastly the design is not well thought out and very unintuitive and does not reveal info such as available balance without extra interaction. I also find it funny how they brag about an award they got 4 years ago. If you made it a native material design app maybe you would be bragging about getting that award for the last 4 years instead. Hire someone who knows native android development please!",

I have Pixel phone, with no issue with any of the 106 Apps installed on it but Tangerine stops after entering password. There is no submit button. I was told by an email to reinstall, which I did 100 times already. I have only two accounts with Tangerine, I am closing them all. Even an employee of Tangerine suggested so.. wow.. instead of fixing the App and listening to the bad reviews about the App, I like the suggestions of simply close my accounts",

No longer supports earlier than Android 4.4.x even though Simplii is still actively providing updates that work on Android 4.0.x.  No good excuses for these issues when other app developers know how to do a good job.  I'm not going to buy a new phone just because this app can't work.  No way to reach Customer Service other than by phone.  Still working on iOS on iPhone 4s but who knows for how long.",

Fingerprint authentication doesn't exist when it does on other banking apps. Electronic deposit of cheques is a pain when the app constantly takes blurry photos and won't focus and you can't get it to focus manually. Thought it was my camera, but on other banking apps the photos for deposits are fine. It gets the job done and it may have been an award winning app 4 years ago. But there doesn't seem to have been any improvement since then while everyone else has been updating with new features.",

Instead of waiting ten minutes in line to cash a cheque, you instead yell at their half baked cheque deposit system for ten minutes. The app recently got a facelift, but it goes from a dot-com-boom era interface to \"there's this new thing called material design, let's play with it\" design, and somehow still manages to feel dated and slow.  Who's surprised though, Tangerine is based on intangible banking, but because of it, loses grip on reality.",

Not for nothing, even though I still can't edit my profile information even after logging out and logging back in, this app is low-key legit once you get the hang of it. Not for nothing but I can see this app getting low-key popular in the future.",

On the other hand, the UI is extremely unintuitive, effect selections are VERY limited, there doesn't seem to be an option to program drums rather than just tapping the pads during live recording, and I wish the social network aspect was its own app. I think there's a ton of potential here, but it's got a lot way to go for that potential to be realized.",

Looks like most of the resources went into tryi g to boost the social aspect of it, which honestly seems like the least interesting part of recording. (I guess everyone has to feel famous first) Next was the difficult to find help section for support on why tracks were not recording in a simple 3 track project. No support there to explain why, and after 3 days of trying to record a second track, still just silence.  Summary - Good idea, poor execution. If you want to record anything, just use something else",

Use Autovoice, use Shortcuts to avoid extra verbage.  It is faster and more customizable anyways.  I was already having to use shortcuts with Tasker Now to shut up google before Tasker Now dismissed it anyways.  Edit: Pixel XL here, so for us Google Now is not an option, Google Assistant or nothing.  Considering I paid for the functionality to work with Google Assistant once, months ago, why would I pay it again every month after it was disabled in what I already pay for, when I can use a competing utility I already own?  Suit yourselves but I'm not buying into the subscription model for this or any other app.  And I'm a developer, so I understand the economics of it.  Edit: fair enough, a refund would be fine",

This causes an environment that refuses to cooperate with many fine Tasker plugins. Enter Tasker Now. This program achieves its user's goals correctly and consistently where other plugins struggle or outright fail. The use and gui are easy and intuitive, allowing for more and more advanced options the deeper you delve into the program. Customer support is absolutely incredible. Pro upgrade was the best $1.08 ive recently spent, and is unbelievably inexpensive given the scope and possibilities of this app. Any fan of Tasker, especially ones struggling with the difficulties of older Samsungs, owe it to themselves to experience the fun of expanding custom control of your smartphone with this app.",

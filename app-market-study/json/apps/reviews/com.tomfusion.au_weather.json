Tried to reinstall, and now when I select a widget, no widget appears in place on screen. 23/03/2017 Reinstalled it, on my HTC after an update, and everything was working well, for the last 8 months. Yesterday the App stopped updating. NO information at all. No temp, current or forecast info. Tried to refresh, and informed unable to update as no auto-location available. Strange since I had set it to use a specific city, Adelaide. Went in and selected Adelaide again, did a refresh and it went back to using auto-location. What The ... ! Funny thing is, I have this app on my Samsung tablet, and it's working fine. This is annoying, as this app is one of the few with a 4x1 widget that is easy to read and well laid out. Tried reinstall, to no avail. I select the 4x1 widget, and despite it asking for set up data, nothing appears on my home screen.",

It has also stopped updating the past few months (my wife and I have both experienced that problem on different devices). Uninstalling.",

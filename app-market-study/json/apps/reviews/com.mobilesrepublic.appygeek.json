Mostly I like that you can set the reading settings to night mode so that it's easy in the eyes as well as change the text size if I remember correctly. I've downloaded this app since day and on every new android device I've ever had and will have; for me this is an app worth having n' it's staying. If you're into all things tech this app is a must have :)",

        "comment": "I like this app a lot. I am very interested in the tech sector and this is such a useful tool to keep updated! It gives you a lot of options for topics to follow for your personalized section. They have the main screen that has various topics. You can search for different topics (ex. technology) or different companies (ex. Google) or types of objects (ex. phone) or specific objects (ex. Google Pixel) or operating systems (ex. Android). Underneath the search it has breakdowns if you would like to further search your term to get more specific articles. You can save articles for later. You can \"react\" to articles which helps the app know what to recommend for you to read. You can adjust notification settings a lot, which I appreciate. I haven't had any issues with the app so far. Great app!",

I do wish, however, there were an easy way to remove approved news sources from the overall pool.  The app is regularly adding new sources to the pool & will confirm if you want to inlude whichever new sources that are available - generally, I think a broader pool is better - but, after approving, I can't figure out exactly how to go back & exclude a previously approved news source.  I mistakenly approved a Spanish-only source, it pops up across my list of topics fairly frequently, yet my Spanish is not good at all &, therefore, the source is not relevant/wanted.  I have yet to be able to remove it.",

Also, at least 1/3 of the articles fail to load its image/video, and it's annoying because when I click for furigana it tries to load again and it randomly scrolls down so i have to look for where i was reading each time i use the furigana button.  Would be 5stars for me if these issues were fixed.",

Only some minor issues prevent me give the app 5 star: Can you add a quick button to show/hide furigana along the article instead of settings? I used this feature many times when read articles (study purpose) and it's quite annoying to go back and forth of the screens. Also a tab for downloaded articles and another tab for online articles is better than going into settings to toggle the option.",

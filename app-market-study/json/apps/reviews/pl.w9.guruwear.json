        "comment": "One of the most useful apps to have on your wrist! Take the time to create your own recipes and you will see the beauty of this app. Love that you can even use your own images, as graphics on the watch make more sense than tiny walls of text. Hope development continues. This app will benefit immensely from partnering up with popular sites like instructables, pinterest, etsy and the like for sharing recipes. Reserving a star for more features, material design, and app/website integrations!",

I can listen for minutes without it dropping a percent or overheating my device on my less than 2000mah battery. Sound quality excellent. No lag when streaming songs. On cable internet when I choose a song I mean click it either instant 99% within 2 seconds it streaming. No bufferiing issues.",

I still don't see the equalizer in here, what's going on??? Any app on Android is years behind iOS. What's the deal??? I really like this app but I much prefer it on my iPhone than on my Android. Just because of the missing equalizer. That's it. That simple. Fix it!!!",

Also a HUGE flaw is the recommendations, especially after you search for a song. I can't find a SINGLE person who would want to listen to all of the search results, I would much prefer listening to songs similar to the first one.  EDIT: Just edited my rating to two stars because they removed one of my most used features: the running services which adapt the music to your BPM. What makes me even more mad is the fact that they did it very silently and don't even give a valid reason on why they're removing it (probably because of the partnership with Nike). So I tried the Nike+ service (which they're boasting a lot) and connection to Spotify doesn't even work. This review will probably remain the same because I'll have moved on to a different music streaming service.",

        "comment": "It's a decent application, but suffers from constant crashes while using it linked to Bluetooth on car headunits- it'll play an advertisement, but then completely freeze and require a force quit and restart of the entire application, of which you have to choose a different playlist from the one originally playing otherwise it will refuse to play. I shouldn't complain about something for free, but when it's barely functional and keeps demanding you try the paid version what incentive do I have if they can't get the free one to work right?",

As a fan of Japanese & Korean music, i think this app lack of collection for that two kind of music. Apple music is far better for song library.",

It's ridiculous little things like that that make it so obvious this app is all about the money. We aren't asking for an ad free app or for to be able to download offline, but to be able to listen to the music that we actually want without paying. This app is awful.

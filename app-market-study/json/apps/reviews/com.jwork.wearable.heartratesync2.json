It works perfectly now and actually does what I wanted it for which is monitor my heart rate during long bike rides. I do hope the developers make it so it can measure my heart rate every 5 or 10 minutes though instead of just every 30. Continuously might be pushing the battery too much, but it still works great.",

I have a huawei watch and even if you set the \"checking timeout\" at 30 secs the app hangs after some time. The heart rate sensor stays lighten up indefinitely and the app does not measure anything. The only way to unlock the situation is to run a check with the \"huawei heart rate app\".  Anyway please fix it. I bought the pro version because the apps is very promising but if it continue with this trend, I think I will really uninstall it.    For now I will give 2 stars. If the problem I mentioned will be fixed I will gladly give 5.",

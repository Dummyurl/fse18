Ever since the update though, it keeps crashing every time I try to use the camera. It even started to do this with other apps as well after I updated it. I wanted to see if it was just my camera that was buggy, so I deleted kik to test it out. My camera was back to normal on other apps after that. I redownloaded it and it started to act up again. Please try to fix this, it's important to be able to contact others incase something happens, I can't do that if it keeps crashing. Thank you!",

I especially loved the mini features where I could swipe through and meet random people. I downloaded it and had it for about 20 minutes and it's just boring and dead. Please bring back the old Kik, it was so fun back then",

It's doesn't happen always but sometimes. It's important to create a good username so they won't find you. They really should fix the conversation issue. Thanks!",

Hopefully developers read this and try to do mute notifications like that.",

One more thing is that when I log out then log back in to try and fix the problem it will send me the other person's conversation. The whole conversation. If you could just fix that, it'd be great!

        "comment": "Loved Kik for many years now but I'm having an issue uploading a profile picture and it's been this way for months. I own a Motog5 and whenever I choose a pic to upload, instead of applying it to my profile it restarts the upload process (goes back to photo album screen, says \"signed in as...\") And sometimes freezes the app. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, turning my phone on and off, switching accounts, no success. I really hope this is recognized and fixed because I know my phone type is generally uncommon, so I could be waiting more months. Thanks for everything, Kik! :)",

The company's helpdesk is a joke as I've only received automated emails saying they cannot help me delete my account at this time.   I've followed the account deletion instructions exactly and am still waiting for the confirmation email from Kik to finalize the account deletion.   The app is alright but beware if you wish to delete your account, you might not be able to. At least that's been my experience.",

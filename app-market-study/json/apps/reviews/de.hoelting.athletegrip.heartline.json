Youtube help video has fault and will not play on anything. Hence only 4 stars. Still v good to see pulse on watch. Deadly accurate as well.",

It connects easily, holds the connection - and is the only app I found that doesn't need wifi turned off to hold a bluetooth connection to the heart rate monitor.   Nice graphical displays too for the current workout. Pity you can't save and view workouts (only export raw data) but it's so much better than everything else I tried (including Mio Go) that I still think it's worth 5*.",

Too late for a refund. It's not that $2.65 is going to break my budget, but I feel abused and taken advantage of. I checked for a free version before I purchased but didn't see one. So I bought it. When I went back to check for a refund, the refund button was gone, but NOW the free version shows up as an option. Pfffgt.",

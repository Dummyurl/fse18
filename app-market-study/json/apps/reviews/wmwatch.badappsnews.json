I've emailed the developer everyday, asking for a status and I've only gotten one reply, stating that Google would be the one to provide a refund. According to Googles policy, once the time limit for a refund from Google has expired, it is the developer that will provide the refund. This developer has refused to even offer a reply for the past 4 days, unacceptable. Be very wary of this developer.",

But I came across this app and gave it a go.  I saw some people say it needs hours to work. I let it run fo literally only a minute. I was going to set my phone down and let it run longer but I just wanted to check one more thing online. The line was already gone and my screen was normal again. Awesome. Try this at least before you return your phone.",

I downloaded an app that uses black and white noise where the ratio is 16:9 a ratio for such an app should be the phones ratio. You did the best possible software fix yet this other app has a better rating just because they don't understand how this works",

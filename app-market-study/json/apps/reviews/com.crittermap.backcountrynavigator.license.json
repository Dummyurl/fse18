I had it downloaded for my area and relied on that everyday for my work, then all of the sudden I go to pull up the app and it's gone. If something isn't broke, don't try to fix it.",

There is one feature that at least in my opinion would make this app COMPLETE, and earn 5 stars status from me; I wish I could track my other friends/hunters in our group as we move around while hunting/hiking, of course we all have this app in our phones. That would be the pinnacle of this great app. That to me/us is very important, and my friends and I all agree that with that feature we could move more freely around knowing the we all know where the others are at. Come on BCN, you can do this!!!!  :) Update: 2/13/18: So BCN, when will you come out with your own gps device and teach GARMIN how's done????",

It is worth far more than the small cost to purchase.  Marvelous app!      Edit: After some time using this app extensively it's still the best. It just gets better and better!  Edit x 2: I just bought this app again for my new phone, simply because the dev deserves it! Terrific app.",

Interface is very nice, so many options for all kinds of uses, very customizable! My phone will last 3 - 4 days using the app for several hours each day (on airplane mode). Just be sure to turn the GPS off when your not using it. Organizing trips and GPX data is easy! Very helpful tech support also!",

There are also third party YouTube videos which are helpful. This is \"back country GPS\" not turn by turn GPS to get you to the nearest doughnut shop. Many maps are available for free download and for in-app purchase. If you are a hiker, a back country camper/explorer, a hunter, a fisherman, etc., then check this application out.",

        "comment": "First off, I love that it doesn't take over my watch face choice or anything else. It just adds an app drawer that you open by swiping from the left which did nothing before.  I hope to see the UI work much more smoothly & responsive in the upcoming updates, and perhaps some customization options after that: such as icon size, options for number of columns, show/hide app titles, maybe make the top bar scrollable & customizable with favorite apps? It's a great app! Looking forward to what's to come!",

Also it would be great to have a timeout feature, so the launcher hides after a configurable duration of inactivity. Found that any other apps that require swiping from the left of the screen conflicts with bubble launcher, would be great if this could detect if another app is open and disable itself.",

Any suggestions?  11/13/15 After being advised by the developer to try it again, I was able to get the checkbox to activate. After activation, I was not able to get any function following the instructions supplied by the developer. Moto 360 gen 2 still not working for me.",

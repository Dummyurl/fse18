        "comment": "It works but only for turning lights on and off from their previous color. I haven't figured out how to change the color of the lights using this app or my watch. Also I don't like how it will always stay on the watch and never close out automatically and go back to the watch face. I have to manually clear it or it will stay on forever draining the battery with the bright white setting screen. Anytime I try to open the 'rooms settings activity' from the watch it crashes",

        "comment": "The UI is horrendous. It shows lights and rooms mixed up together which in itself makes it hard to manage. On a Sony SmartWatch 3 the names of lights and rooms are also cut off. \"Living room Left\" turns into \"Living room\" with \"room\" cut horizontally. Impossible to identify lights and rooms without trial. When activating a light it activates with full brightness instead of using previous values like every other app. Still, all in all it gets the job done until Philips hopefully makes their own app.",

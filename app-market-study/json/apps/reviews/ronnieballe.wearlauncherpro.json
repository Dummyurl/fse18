It works so seamless I would swear it's part of Android wear. This launcher works every time on the first swipe from the left side just as quickly and easily as the native wear launcher swipes in from the right. This launcher does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it does it flawlessly. There is no need to take out the phone to adjust settings as everything is done right on the watch",

I can open my watch face and  hold the left side of my watch , feel a vibration and swipe right and there are all my apps. I can select the number of rows (I selected 2 rows works perfect for the round face) I can move my favorite apps to the top; of the rows and I can hide the apps that I don't use. What more could I want for a launcher? I would next like to see the battery drain and will u;date, but so far I'm loving this. I can't tell you how many launchers I downloaded and deleted before finding this one !  Most of the others have lag or you have to swipe a couple of times to open them. Not this one!",

What they've done is intuitive.  UPDATE: the app doesn't even stay active. Have to keep restarting it. Mini Wear Launcher is always active, even after restarting the device.",

After install it wouldn'appear in apps on my watch even after sync fron wear app...  I had to reset the watch, reconnect to phone, reinstall wear app, reinstall the launcher, resync and the app appeared in the watch r applications.  Manual start and bingo.  It works !",

Looks better and works better plus the ability to choose where to slide finger and how big of a space is a huge plus.  My only complaint tho is should be able to customize app tray from phone as well as on watch. Its rather annoying having to tap up 25 times to put apps where you want em in order.  Thanks for the excellent launcher",

Brightness controls in the watch face 'fight' with the Moto360 settings, so it can get a bit disco at times. The dark face is pointless, it only flashes randomly. Nice when you see it, but it would be better if you could set it to show at night (to protect your night vision - this is a very bright watch face). Love the data, but the fonts, brightness issues and so on make this a tough keeper.",

I prefer the black & white mode, but the settings are somewhat convoluted and getting there is a challenge.  Some additional colors for both background in color mode and foreground for B&W mode would be nice.  A red background for low light would be nice to preserve night vision.    I would love to use this face, but when it is installed on my watch, it goes through about 1/4 of the battery every 2-3 hours.  Tweaking the update settings help a little, but not much.  The design and look of this face is 4 star quality, but until the battery drain is improved, I have to give it only 2.",

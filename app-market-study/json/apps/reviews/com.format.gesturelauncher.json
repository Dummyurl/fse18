        "comment": "Wear Gesture Launcher lets you start an app with a simple tap-then-gesture combination.  It should work with almost any watch face.  It is faster than any other launcher I have used.  This launcher solves a fundamental problem with Wear launchers.  The user interface on a watch is just never going to be good at selecting one item from a large collection.  Wear Gesture Launcher eliminates the need to display everything you could choose by letting you create your own gestures for the apps you use regularly.  Wear Gesture Launcher works very well.  It's easy to set up, fast to use, and reliable.  It is not intended to replace the default launcher entirely, but it does eliminate the need to use it at least 90% of the time for me.",

Would love to be able to launch any app, including system apps with it. Also what about other actions like changing watch settings, volume, etc. Also would love to initiate the gesture recognition with a hardware button instead of the overlay button. Also would be nice if it didn't matter the direction you draw the gesture, but just compared the final image image. Tasker integration would be amazing!",

        "comment": "Great app for easily and quickly access key apps on Android smartwatch! However, Would it be possible to have an option to disable the screen corners and instead go into gesture mode by launching the app? That way I could trigger the gesture capture through an app launch complication or a hardware button instead of a screen corner overlay, which actually blocks some Wear functions no matter which corner.  [2017-11-22] thanks for the latest update! The additional features (gesture capture on app launch and different screen corner sizes) are definitely a great addition! Now it is so convenient to open any app on my Wear watch.",

First there doesn't seem to be any options for which calendars to show, not too big of a deal, especially for a free app with no ads.  However there is a crash bug.  If you tap a highlighted date and then tap a listed event the app will immediately crash and then restart.  My calendars are all synchronized with owncloud via caldav so maybe my case is special but I can't immagine how that might contribute to the crash, beyond that it works fine.",

Google Birthdays... yes we all are affected by the spam of Birthdays from Google, but unfortunately this app does not have a filter to remove unwanted items like Birthdays / Holidays from being displayed.  Other calendering apps allow you to pick which calendars to show, this one does not... it reads and displays all of your calendars in Google, and with no filtering, will show birthdays along side your normally subscribed items in your schedule. My Request: a feature / update with a way to filter calendars and birthdays / holidays. If this is done, it will be 5/5 stars... still a good app...",

First off, swiping left and right to move between months on the default month view makes it difficult to dismiss the app, which is a standard swipe to the right on Android Wear. Swiping up and down to move between months would be more intuitive on this platform.  Also, selecting a day on the month view to see the agenda for that day is difficult because the days are tiny.  Some kind of aid for selection would help here.  And finally, when you get to the Agenda view it is squeezed into a square within the round Moto 360 display and with the square that small all appointments are truncated.  The app could be improved a lot if round devices were also comprehended. So I guess for now my search continues.",

Considering the limited screen space available on a watch, this is about the maximum amount of information you can get out of a wearable calendar.  There are some suggestions I'd like to make for future development: 1) When I click on the location in the event details, open maps. 2) A weekly view (Sun-Wed top row, Thur-Sat bottom row) with the events listed would be nice.  Other than those two things that I'd like to see implemented some time in the future, I can't see a single things wrong or deficient with this app. (I have my watch face set up so that when I click on the day's date, it opens this app for me.)",

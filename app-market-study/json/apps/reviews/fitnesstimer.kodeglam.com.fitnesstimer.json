        "comment": "I'm sorry, but this is completely useless. First off, the devs don't understand intervals. The flow of the app is completely screwed up. It should be a warm up period....then workout...then rest. The workout/rest periods repeat for a variable number of times...then there is a cool down period.  It has great potential but it needs work. However, seeing that it hasn't been updated since September 2014 I think its safe to say this app is out of business.",

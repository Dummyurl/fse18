It was from a second party supplier and could not get a refund or replacement. I tried multiple times and got nowhere. Money down the drain for a useless battery.",

Groupon was unwilling to help I  any way and the the spa,  Spavia, was unwilling to help. The refused to refund, credit, or unredeem the voucher. Very disappointed in the customer service. Groupon is not secure and others have access to your information.",

What I hate is that all the travel discounts are flying out of US destinations in US dollar on Groupon Canada, why do we never get the opportunity for these deals??

        "comment": "I love Groupon. I use it for experiences as opposed to buying goods, which I think is where some people have had negative experiences. After all, Groupon is simply advertising the goods on offer from other sellers so if there's a problem with that item they can't do much.   I use Groupon instead to buy fitness classes and memberships and local things to do. I've got climbing memberships and belay certifications, unlimited gym memberships, hair cuts, manicures and pedicures, aerial silks classes and belly dancing classes with this app. As a grad student I love it because I live on a tight stipend and it allows to me to access services I wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. Moreover, because it's affordable I can try new things and find out about local events I wouldn't otherwise have known about.",

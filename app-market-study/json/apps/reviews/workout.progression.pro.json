Good to setup, great sync to other devices, good tracking or progress, good modern material design, good summary charts by muscle group, good template workouts but also easy custom workouts. Improvement suggestions would be , allow drag and drop change the order of excercise added to a workout as they can change weekly , and, allow to delete an excercise once added. Simple things but would make usability massivly better",

I started using it about 9 months ago and have just paid for the app as it is simply the best training / personal fitness / bodybuilding app out there. I have lost 45 lbs and gained strength in the process. Thanks for this app!! I couldn't recommend this more!",

My only complaint (and only reason I took a star off) is that when trying to make two different superset groups, it will not let you add the same exercise which really stinks. I'd love to be able to create two different groups for super sets and be able to have the same exercise in each. If this can be changed, I'd gladly change my rating to 5.",

Some exercises are listed as targeting multiple muscle groups, eg. the chin up targets the back and biceps. On the workout history page, only the primary muscle group is displayed on the graph (in the case of chin ups, biceps wouldn't be displayed). Would it be possible to add an option to also include the other muscle groups on the graph, adjusted by proportion?",

Dev is quick to respond & has some great features lined up for future release (e.g., more advanced chart analysis. 1RM, total volume, total reps, etc.)",

Here are some highlights of this app that are important to me.  * Simple layout, easy to navigate * Single screen for recording each set AND quickly reviewing previous workouts * Easy to add notes to each set * Countdown timer between sets that can be quickly adjusted * App stays running and continues to countdown when I switch to another app * Tons of pre-loaded exercises (I only needed to add two extra exercises to the exercise pool)  The biggest reason I\u2019d recommend this app is because the developer is VERY responsive and is constantly improving this app. If you lift weights and need to record your workouts \u2013 get this app.",

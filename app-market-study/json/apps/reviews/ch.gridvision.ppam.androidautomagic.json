        "comment": "UPDATE: After months of performing flawlessly, since the last update, none of my flows are working any more. They're fine if i manually 'Execute' them, but they're no longer firing automatically.  PREVIOUS: I wanted to create a simple script which would set my phone's screen lock to use a PIN when I was at home and a password  when I was elsewhere. Having previously tried Tasker and Automate; both of which seemed only to offer the option to enable/disable screen locking entirely, I didn't hold out much hope for this lesser known alternative. But the reviews were encouraging and I thought I'd give it a go. 15 mins later and *Hooray!* I now have a phone which uses a simple PIN no. at home (I still want some privacy!) and automatically switches to a stronger password when I'm away from home. UPDATE: I reinstalled the Qpython plugin and Automagic picked it up the second time. So all good now and another star added.",

        "comment": "Really great app. Using it with mi band tools, sleep as Android and DI.fm radio.    I have created 3 pretty involved flows. One that watches sleep as Android sleep start. Then posts a status bar notification that mi band tools reads and changes mi band to continus heart rate monitoring.   In the morning sleep as Android alarm fires silently. Automagic kicks off di.fm radio with some conditional loops.  Adjusts volume with slow raise.    Once I stop sleep as Android. Automagic then stops di.fm from playing as well as closing the app and adjusting a few things back to my preference.  All without root.   I will say non root did make some of the things I want a little more complex but I was still able to mostly achieve my goals.  One thing I am concerned about is since I am using  accessibility functions. These will most likely be broken once Google pulls. Apps that allow this.  :(",

        "comment": "I feel the need to come back and revise my previous review. This is a fantastic alternative to Tasker, I may even say better in some ways. I've recently converted almost all of my tasks over and deleted Tasker along with the several plugins I had installed for it - since most of what I needed the plugins for is actually baked in to this app already... Tasker had been starting to act weird for me so I decided to give Automagic another go before I look at other alternatives. It took a little getting used to, some of the ways you have to do things is imo not very intuitive - but once you figure it out you just know and it becomes natural. It is actually really awesome, low footprint and much prettier layout if you're into that kind of thing. The scripting is very powerful and enjoyable to use. Though I do stand by what I said about support being practically non existent - when I run into problems, I want to do a Google search, get a little insight into how to achieve what I want to - learn something along the way and carry on. I don't want to have to email the developer directly and wait whoever knows how long for a reply. You probably get thousands of emails a day, I shouldn't have to be bothering you with that kind of stuff - but like I said - information is scarce. The forum is closed off, new registrations need to be approved or something before you can even post - so have to wait to even be able to ask a question to begin with at the official source of help. The subreddit is an absolute ghost town - almost all threads remain unanswered there. Google+, I don't really see anything here. There's maybe 2 communities - and one of them is Italian so I can't use that. I almost settled on the 4 stars because of this - but I'm enjoying it a lot and it seems very reliable so in terms of such a robust app with limitless possibilities it is definitely 5 star. I just wish there was better information out there. Nobody seems to know what Automagic is - and that is a damn shame.",

The forums are very helpful when looking for recipes for various use cases and the author is also getting involved and active on the forums, while maintaining the app to keep up with the Android updates. This app is also a show case of Android's openness and versatility (esp. if you have root, but that's not mandatory) and one of the reasons I could never switch to a closed system like iOS (there's no equivalent for this powerful app in that ecosystem).",

After installing this app and without much knowledge I was able to create a flow that allowed me to open my calendar follow by tasks with conditions to activate from 6 am to 8am, when turning the screen on for the first time. That meant that if I turn the screen off and then on again it wouldn't trigger till the next day. With No much knowledge. Now that's impressive.   Update: WONDERING if this app allows to set scenes like tasker. Basically a pop up notification that is interactive.",

After some research I also found Automagic and of those three, it's the best solution for me. Modern interface compared to Tasker, lots of integrated features where you needed a Tasker-plugin before and much easier for complex tasks than AutoMate.",

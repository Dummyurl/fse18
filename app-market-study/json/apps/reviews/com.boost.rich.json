The more disapointing to find out that The lines and details in ambient mode are pixelated and partly undefined and even invisible. Really hope you will fix that in future but hey thanks anyway for The good job allready. Greetz Cliff",

My biggest complaint is that the second ring does not move smoothly and the digital time at the top seems to jerk a bit as the time changes.

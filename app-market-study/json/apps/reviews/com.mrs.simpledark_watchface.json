Cause everything related to colors are based on fixed color codes.\n\nI won't guarantee this options in future version but I promise I will try to implement.",

Thus gives more battery life with all useful features and compilations.  Like the following features the most: 1) calendar in the custom compilation. 2) 13-24 marker  3) digital clock, with actual digital font and color  Great job !",

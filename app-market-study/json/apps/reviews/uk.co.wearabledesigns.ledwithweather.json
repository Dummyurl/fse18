I like the watch face but I can see these constant resets being more trouble than they're worth down the road.

        "comment": "Pretty nice watch face, very useful features. However, it seems that the 'forecast widget' just seems to be poorly aligned alone, and it really does not look as presentable (at least on my moto 360).   A slightly bigger icon at least as big as the fonts for the temperature would probably fix this, along with a tad bit of spacing so it would not be cramped in the middle. Either that or just change the forecast to words altogether (at least for the forecast only setting). Not really sure how that would turn out either. Also, while there is an option to center the time, it does not seem to actually center it horizontally (the time is slightly off to the left). This happens with or without the seconds. The battery numbers are also oddly spaced it seems (maybe needs left/right align to icon).  If these are at least remedied, I would gladly give 5 stars.  For the future, more customizable color options are certainly appreciated. Maybe an option for just one widget would be great too.   Note: For Nougat users, just note that you would need to enable locations permissions from your phone as well as the watch for auto location weather to work.",

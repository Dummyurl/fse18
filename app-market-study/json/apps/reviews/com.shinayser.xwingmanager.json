Thank you for creating this app. I have nothing to say, that isn't mentioned in previous comments, and actually I think that most of the things said are already fixed, as I cannot see them. The only thing, and it's really a small one, that buggers me a bit, is Ezra on the Sheathipede. He is with pilot skill 5, but the app displays it as PS 3. Other than that, everything is absolutely awesome. Keep up the good work! Cheers!",

Edit to Response: Apologies did not meant to upset, your app is very good and I usually buy apps to remove adverts as they drain battery etc but the price is a little steep. Totally your prerogative to price how you see but this will limit your customer base as what kid/young adult has that kind of money to use when a pen and paper or other free app will suffice. Keep up the good work and you effort is appreciated, I only wish there was a more realistic minimum, see other apps mate not many are that steep... Rating increased to show support :-)",

Unless there is already a way to do that and I'm just not seeing it.. Otherwise, very clean UI, easy to use, I can't say enough good things. Great job!",

If that was fixed it would really get a higher rating. It's much better when you have a few points to spare to be able to see everything that cost that amount together rather than the annoying alphabetical list that leaves you having to scroll back and forth.   Would hit t stars if it didn't cost so much to remove ads. \u00a37 four cheapest option is a hell of alot for such a simple app.",

Lifts your spirit in celebration of human creativity!  Now it is on my watch!  Couldn't be happier.  Get a big old life-affirming jolt whenever I check the time.  Hoping for a refresh every now and then with new art, but don't want to lose my favorites.  It is on the watch FOR GOOD!",

This app is great, when folks notice my watch I always get \"WOW, that is cool\"!  Great app Google, keep up the good work!  For those that don't see the new watch face, I thought the same thing also, it takes a moment for it to sync to your phone after you download it.  I was about ready to call it junk and delete it also then BOOM, it showed up in the Android Wear app.",

I would not mind if the card was at the real bottom of my stack, so I could access the information if I wanted. I think that this would be the best behaviour, as the idea behind the watch and Google Now, is that the notifications are \"Pull Based\".  A simple configuration option regading the Artist Card where I could specify where the card appears, \"On Top\", \"On the Bottom\" or \"Disable the card\" appaeaing.",

        "comment": "Update: Cannot praise developer highly enough. Immediately responded to a query and a suggestion. Excellent!  The best assistant to giving up smoking that I have found. Easy to use but comprehensive history, targeting and incentives make it a no brainer to rate 5 Stars.  One feature request - the option to remember the last used time scale when using Chart History facility. Currently always defaults to 90 days and I ALWAYS change to 30. No major chore but it would be great if it remembered.  Paid for this app within hours of installing. Excellent.  Significant reduction in my smoking by the way. Thanks.  Amendment: Add to the words above that the developer is incredibly responsive. Superb.",

It makes me conscious of when, why and triggers by recording details before I light up. I think I will quit successfully this time. It's also helpful discerning my emotions throughout the day. The developer may want to make a sepearate app for once you quit to simply record how you're feeling at a given moment, it's helpful to access your triggers and calms me down a bit just to record it and see patterns. Thank you",

        "comment": "This is a simple, functional and handy program- it does exactly what I wanted and hasn't got cheesy motivational messages, just a simple \"Good on you for not smoking\" message when you press the button to soon.  One suggestion; an optional sound- any sound/song/tone- the user has which plays when the time is up (you can smoke). You hear the sound, light your cig and press the button/log the smoke then there is a user delay ['x' minutes]- a rough estimate of time it takes you individually to actually smoke the cig- and then the timer starts again automatically. The reason is I like a lot of people tend to watch YouTube or go on Facebook etc. on my phone when I go outside to smoke and end up watching the video/reading after the cig then just go back to whatever I was doing and totally forget to push the button to start the timer again. Hope you find my suggestion helpful, it is the only problem I have with an otherwise excellent and simple piece of software. Well done",

The support team is great here as well. They helped me transfer my data over to a new phone and responded right away. Very helpful!  My only recommendation is a few tweaks with the graphs. Being able to set a default view would be helpful. i.e. locking it in for the last 7 days for example. Also the time/cig count graph is a bit non-intuiative and confusing. I feel like that can be redesigned to be cleaner and make more sense. Maybe break it up into two separate graphs, one above the other? Having the green (# of smokes) melt behind the blue (time between smokes) just doesn't sit well with me. Just a thought.  Bottom line is, this has been a very helpful tool! If you get an actual designer involved for the layout and such, you'd have solid gold here. Cheers!",

Using this app from the start I cut my smoking in half just by being conscious of the amount of time that had elapsed since my last cigarette. It has really helped me psychologically. And because the smoking interval is self-imposed I don't feel guilty if I don't make it to, say, 50 minutes. At least I know that each time I smoke it's a conscious decision and not a mindless act. I recommend this app to anyone trying to cut down or quit smoking. P.S. I started Chantix today and will be reducing my number of cigarettes goal throughout the next couple of weeks.",

        "comment": "Great app but I have a suggestion. It would be great to tell the app I'm going to bed, and I woke up. And that would automatically adjust the average time between cigarettes. If I have even one after midnight, then wake up at 830am, my average time between smokes is off and my first smoke in the morning says my average is several hours. Even by end of day it still says hours between smokes because of that sleeping gap. A sleep button would be amazing compared to adjusting settings every other day. I don't ALWAYS sleep at the same time EVERY day. I don't want to go into settings to adjust anything. I'm going to sleep, waking up, ignore that time. Simple.",

Very easy to track when you smoke and you can input your craving level, mood, and satisfaction level after the smoke. There is only one thing I don't like about it. For \"number of smokes per day\" if you change that number out changes your entire history instead of just that day and future days. So when I started I was at 20 smokes per day. Now I'm at 10, but that makes it look like all the previous days I failed to meet my goal because I smoked more than 10.",

Works for any habit you are trying to quit, even though it says \"smoke\" everywhere... I'd give it five stars if the charts were a little better. Because of how the zoom works, if you zoom in and try to scroll it will swipe to the next screen. Irritating, but not a big deal.",

        "comment": "Really very good. many years ago I wrote a Visual Basic application for iPaq (Archery Logbook) with many many things equals to this app.  This one is very well done, its easy to use, fast to record shots, and provides very useful information. I Like very much the ability to record the order and the number of the arrows then you can see groups made by arrow, and/or shooting order. You can improve your shooting, fine tune your equipment, and adjust your sight scope much better and precise. Using this application correctly makes your training sessions double efficiency. Thanks for this contribution to archery and.... When is going to be available for IOS devices too?",

One thing i would love to see though would be an option to set distances ( simillar to arrow selection ) if your ranges are unkown and for tracking purposes be able to see groupings by range. Maybe seperate colored circles around the two farthest shots for each range ? Other than that amazing app keep up the good work. Oh and a port to IOS.  Update: Noticed the new grouping features in the most recent update while practicing on 115 targets. Amazing job! The choices for grouping worked perfectly to show exactly what was needed to help improve my shots! Cant wait for the next update. One thing that we noticed was it would be helpful to be able to flip the 3D targets as not all targets face the same direction.",

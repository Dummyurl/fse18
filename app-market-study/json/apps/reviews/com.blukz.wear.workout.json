It would be nice to have a few more settings and personalization options in the app such as the ability to shuffle the order of the workouts and change the vibration settings as well as set up reminders in case you forget to work out. Also a bit more proofreading should be done in the exercise discretions because I noticed that \"to\" was used instead of \"two\" in places.",

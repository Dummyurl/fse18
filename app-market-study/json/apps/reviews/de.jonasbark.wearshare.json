        "comment": "I liked the concept but this app crashes every time I try to share from my Moto X to my 360.  Update- reinstalled, doesn't crash anymore, but nothing appears on my watch.     Update 2- figured out some of the nuances of the app. Can't share from textra because that's where the app was crashing. It works when sharing from the gallery.  Also you have to share twice to get it on the watch, once from the app, then again from the notation drawer. Not exactly seamless, but it works. Upgrading my review to 3 stars",

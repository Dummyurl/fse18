May I suggest you if possible to enhance:  I start the call from watch. My bluetooth hands-free is in my ear. On watch, the bluetooth sign is on the blue button bottom right. I start to push the button. bluetooth &gt; phone speaker &gt; phone earpiece &gt; phone speaker &gt; phone earpiece &gt; .... so I do not have the possibility to came back on hands-free device.  also the status of the used device on the phone display  does not change. the phone will continue to show bluetooth is used, even I'm already on speaker or earpiece.  samsung s6 and LG watch R both on 5.1.1.  10x!  robert",

(I have a feeling the answer is \"no\" due to API limitations.) - on a long call, the screen eventually \"times out\". Is there a control for how long this takes?",

This app does exactly that even if you started the call on the phone. The bad news is that the app dissappears shortly after starting it, if I've started it by hand it should stay open until I swipe it closed. Fix that and it's a clear 4, making the mute button the biggest on the screen an easy 5.(FYI I have not used any other functions of the app)",

        "comment": "This app is honestly one of the reasons I started looking at Smartwatches in the first place. When I found out I can mute/unmute a call in-progress from my wrist without having to take my phone out of my pocket, unlock the screen, and change windows to get back to the phone app, I knew that I needed to have it.  I spend a lot of time on conference calls so being able to quickly and easily mute/unmute my mic is vital.  What's also real nice is it doesn't seem to matter if I start or answer the call from the phone, the app, or \"OK Google\".    The only problem, and that keeps me from giving a 5th star, is that I can't for the life of me figure out how to get back to the call-in-progress screen if I leave the app on my watch.  I was just in a call a few minutes ago, received some notifications from other apps during the call, and tried to return back to Watch Phone, but couldn't control the ongoing call anymore.  This functionality, if it exists, doesn't seem to be very intuitive.",

All I have to do is say to my watch, \"Okay Google... start Watch Phone\" and it opens the app on the watch. I can initiate calls, look at my call log, all contacts and favorites. It even supports multiple numbers per contact: this app does it all! Since I have a Bluetooth headset, I can now make calls to anyone without ever reaching for my phone. That saves me a lot of screen-on time, which extends the phone's battery life. A true WIN all the way around!  WELL DONE to the Developer!

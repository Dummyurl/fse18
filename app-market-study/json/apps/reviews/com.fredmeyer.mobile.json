Even with the Clicklist stuff unchecked in filters it still shows up in the coupon list. Now we have to wade through all the coupons that are ONLY for Clicklist. (Only 8 people on the planet are interested in clicklist so why do we have all those coupons interspersed with regular coupons?). A complete waste of time.",

If it is changed to include a shop by department or aisle, it would help. I like being able to see the weekly add in either list or print view. But there's so many items you miss when looking only at sale items.",

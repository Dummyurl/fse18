It is a little spartan in terms of the interface, but it works and is free!!  Improvements should include easier playlist integration, allow music to be loaded from SD storage and allow folders(albums) to be uploaded instead of clicking each song.",

        "comment": "Of the two apps I found that could play music stored on the watch without being connected to the phone, this one is better. The transfer interface is decent, but could be improved. Specifically, it does not support browsing files anywhere but on the phone's internal storage, so I had to copy all of the music I wanted to sync from my SD card. There is also no way to see what is on the phone or the sync progress without navigating through all the folders. I like that it supports playlists, but it is unclear how to create them; I had to use the debugger to find out where the files are saved and use absolute paths (/data/user/0/...) for each item in the playlist. Codec and tag support is good, so no re-encoding is necessary. It would also be nice if the player could be controlled by bluetooth.",

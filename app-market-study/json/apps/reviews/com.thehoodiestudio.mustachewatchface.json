I would like to see one thing implemented though- After changing the watchface or any settings, it does not update on the watch instantly. I've seen other apps be able to do this. I would like to see some \"push changes to watch\" action. Since being on Wear 2.0, I'm not sure if it is an issue now, but changes don't even reflect on the watchface, it seems. I'm stuck with the default white face. Thanks for any feedback on this thought. Edit: The face finally updated after ~15 minutes or so.",

This gets the balance right in looking a bit digital but also with a touch of old watch class. Very well done.",

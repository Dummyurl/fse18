Definitely try to figure out what's causing that because I figure this would have way more downloads if people could find it easier. Also, please add support for Android Wear 5.1's always on feature so I don't have to keep relaunching the app every time my watch screen times out. It also crashes every now and then on my Moto 360 running 5.1. Also please add an option to tap to roll",

You guys are on point. I don't use the tactile response, but love that it's an option. Keep up the good work!",

What version OS is your watch running? Original G Watch, or the G Watch R? Do you get the same crash on the phone version of the app? \n\nFeel free to email me the details, and I will happily try to correct this.",

For instance one loses the placed bet, when the app is exited. Or even if you win a little, you end up with less money than you started with. But still it's a lot of fun and astoundingly good for a watch game.",

And the developer has done a spectacular job (though I do wonder why one's bet only shows some of the time - this is a confusing design flaw!). Blackjack Wear looks fantastic, it's easy to use, works flawlessly and most importantly, it's plenty of fun! Very highly recommended, for all users of Android Wear \"smart\" watches.",

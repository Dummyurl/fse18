I mentioned this I my first review, (no longer shown) several  years ago and was told it wasn't an option. Why? Both my hand held GPS units support the track up option. This may not be an issue for others but i find it hard to believe lm the only one that would find this usefull. Be cause of this I don't use the app very much. Your mileage may vary",

I walked 7km in flat open country with no trees, buildings or mountains around and it only recorded 384m as the distance travelled. There were no other apps that I'm aware of running in the background which might have also been using gps/cpu. Phone is a Samsung Galaxy S5.  Edit: Thanks for the suggestions, I did have a battery saving feature on. I will try that again without.",

On a work trip I carry equipment that is bulky & fiddly, weighs lots, and $100's of dollars. 2 hardware cameras, a GPS, cables, 2 compasses, a metal inclinometer. On days off HandyGPS is a really good Jack-of-all-trades that serves as well, and far lighter. Hardware capabilities vary with different phones, so I email Anthony with questions and he suggests workarounds. Lots of features - some of the criticisms I see in these reviews are from people who didn't look through all the options & menus. Hint - the phone's GPS eats battery (HandyGPS doesn't), so carry a portable phone charger.",

Update 11/28: Thank you for the quick reply, dev.  05/20: Thanks for the latest updates, dev! Which of the two methods for creating routes do you recommend? Can I use the same routing features if I use the original method (join)? I prefer that one since it allows me to save it.",

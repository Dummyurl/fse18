It isn't super intuitive to use but I got the hang of it after a few minutes. It isn't the prettiest app ever but no big deal.  My nitpick would be that when playing back audio on Android Wear it does not respond to pause/play commands from my headphones like every other app seems to do. This would be nice to see added.",

Move music files to music folder, and use music player to play on the watch. google wants me to upload to their player, or join a subscription. No way. This app does what I need. Con: transfer is a bit slow, I think that is a hardware issue, cause this developer writes a great app, I can deal with a little slow transfer for each song one time.",

However when copying files, it does not recognize ones already copied, so the transfer then takes much longer.   Could and should be great, but is let down on greed and lack of functionality.  This app should be getting around 2MB second and is not.",

Also, when the app errors on a file transfer, the phone needs to be restarted in order to begin transferring again and the app adds duplicate files to transfer.",

This sound player stands above the rest because does nearly everything that I need. These are the features that work and I really appreciate:  - Easily sync sound files from phone to app  - Easily browse through sound files on watch  - The app resumes a file in the same spot where it previously had stopped playing   - The app has a ff/rw option to skip around within the sound file    Yes there are ads in the free version of the app, but I find them acceptable.  I do not use the image section of the app so have no comments on that part.  In a perfect world (and maybe in the future, as I will be suggesting the developer add these) the app would also include these features:   - I cannot ff/rw songs with my Bluedio bluetooth headphone forward/backward buttons  - I cannot delete sound files I am done with from the watch app  - I cannot delete sound files from the phone app from either the watch or the phone (instead I have to use the phone's file manager app)",

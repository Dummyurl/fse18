Also, must admit, after trying lots of competitors, returning to Plantronics Backbeat FIT was smart move. Their bud design offers the most stability + snuggest fit in my broad basis for comparison.",

The other day I was in the store trying on clothes, and when I got outside to my car realized I had lost my Bluetooth. I actually had to ask them to turn the music playing over the speakers all over the store, which they did, and subsequently found my bluetooth in the pocket of one of the pair of pants that I had tried on. That was awesome! And I knew it was in the store because when I turn the app on in the store it was showing it and when I got to my car it said not connected anymore so I went back in the store and ask them to turn the music down so I can listen for the tone.",

        "comment": "I do like the app. But the app is not necessary in order to use the headset. The one thing where I can find fall is with the button labeled find my headset. Unless your headset is sitting or perched against something that can reflect the sound then you will never find it. The only way it might work is if you drop it in your car. If you know the general location you can use that in order to locate it. I would have preferred to be able to change the voice on the headset. There are a lot of things I would like but those are not considered in the versions of the app so far. Other than that the app works perfectly. I am using the Motorola Droid Maxx with the latest OS version. There is one additional problem which is easily remedied. I don't want the app running all of the time the. I believe I will choose which apps we'll run all the time and which won't. When you close the app it is running until you force it to shut down. Like I said it's an easy remedy.",

The most important and worthwhile feature, find my headset was a total waste of time. On the loudest volume, even using the \"Loud&Obnoxious\" tone, I couldn't hear it at all. It was only a foot away from the phone, and I could only just hear the tone as I raised it to my ear. Once the headset is out of sight, or arm's reach, it won't be found with this app. Unless you just need a reminder of which ear you're wearing it on, don't bother downloading the app. Aimed at Hero, landed on Zero.",

You can not use this app to actually find a lost Edge but maybe it works on a other device.  We need much louder sound to ve able to find the device.  I rate this to useless as it's today.  The though is nice but the performance is 99% useless.  Needs a great update.  Voyager Edge is so expensive so it would be great to have an app that actually works.  Headset is extremely well made,  works flawlessly at alk tines.  I would hate to loose it.  Pkease make an update so we can find our headsets.  Best regards Bj\u00f8rn Erik Bj\u00f8rklund,  Norway",

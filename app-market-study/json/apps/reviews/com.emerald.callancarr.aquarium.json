It makes your watch look truly state of the art, classy and elegant. Everyone in the office has complimented it at least once. I'll be in a meeting and my watch will turn on and someone will make note of the nice \"fish aquarium\" on my wrist.  As far as these other reviews are concerned I have experienced none of the problems they have; The watch face installs and runs fine with my setup. I've also easily found the customisation options, you access them by pressing a little gear at the bottom of the watch face in the watch face selection screen.  You can change the aquarium background, customise each fish in the aquarium and change things like 24/12 hour, to display the date etc.  All on top of this the battery life is incredible, lasting a lot longer than any other animated watch face I've tried.  All in all, nothing short of the best watch face I've tried so far.",

The design is visually top class, and the voice control works perfectly. Also the ability to set the Thermostat into \u2018Home\u2019 & \u2018Away\u2019 mode directly from the watch is extremely useful!  Excellent communication from the developer when I had some queries after first installing.   All in all, just what I\u2019ve been looking for to control the Nest from my Moto 360.",

Specifically, it does not know if the thermostat is off, heating, or cooling.  As a result, it always shows a temperature below the set point as red (heating) and above the set point as green (cooling).  This can be confusing, since you'll think your Nest is running when it isn't.  If this could be corrected, this would be a five-star app!",

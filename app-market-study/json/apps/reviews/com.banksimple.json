        "comment": "I've been trying out quite a few banks. I keep a traditional bank like Chase or USAA so I can have checks and ATM deposits but I also like online banks because they don't charge overdraft or ATM fees, but unfortunately Simple charges you to withdraw. I don't have any banks near me I can withdraw for free. Also, sometimes it seems my transactions aren't loaded in real time. I frequently check my account but I can check it after buying $30 worth of gas and it won't show as a pending charge for a a day or two which isn't bad when I remember but if I've been getting a little swipe happy or forget then I can easily spend too much because the transactions aren't updating and showing that I have more money than I actually do. With USAA & Chase I get paid a day early (thursday), but with simple I don't get paid until Friday, not a huge deal but it's amazing how you get used to that difference & I do wish they did the same. Overall, ours probably one of the better online banks. I like the look of their app and debit card, but if they updated the few things I mentioned then I think I would keep them as my main bank instead of a place to stash a few extra bucks.",

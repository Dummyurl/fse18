Then, when you press back it takes you to the 1st pokemon info on the list which is Bulbasaur. It's annoying since scrolling is a bit slow. I wouldn't mind spending $2 if you add map feature. Hope you do.",

It tells you moves and shows you stuff like level or how to evolve, shiny forms, gender different forms, and much more. It is truly remarkable. Hopefully you can do 7th gen shiny/gender forms and 3D versions of them? Gym and trainer details would be fine, also an item list is at the top of my worries, I never remember what items there are and especially what they do. Also this is a minor detail but for the team builder can you make it to where you can decide what ball they're in please? Thank you.",

Also, a slight ux improvement: the app screen has no cue that it swipes up to reveal the graph; people see that dial screen and think that's it.",

Add weather icons to the Barometer settings (where you can select to have weather icons showing on the wheel along with the pressure units) and somehow to the Widget (that would really be ideal).  2.  Offer an AD free version (I would buy that).",

In settings, it's calibratable and displays in different units. I've set it to read the same as my Davis weather station, and it compares well (but that's more a test of the phone's pressure tx). Obviously, on a phone, the measurement will change as you travel about, as elevation affects the pressure. I'd happily pay for this app",

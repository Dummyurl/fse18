The other thing i find interesting is how you get it for car security and you have to give up your phone security and privacy for it.  It demands access  to your camera and files which have nothing to do with a car alarm. .. I've had it for almost 3 years, works great for the alarm but the privacy and battery issue are a draw back",

Sometimes that could happen because the vehicle doesn't have a clear view of the sky and isn't able to update the fix when it should, but occasionally we find that we have to do an over the air reset to GPS. \n\nThanks!",

Be nice to show a Bluetooth status so I know if I'm connected or not. The Bluetooth icon apparently means nothing.

        "comment": "Great idea. Horrible delivery. You can unlock, lock, and start. It does alert you via email, text and the app if a alarm is triggered.  The text message is just a bunch of random characters,  but you'll at least get a notification.  If you have internet connection on your phone and cellular connection on your vehicle, it gets the basic job done. (I liked vrsion 3.0 better though)    DI should have used a freelance service to get better developers.  The biggest issue i have is the clunky behavior of the app, resulting in a slow response. It feels like the spent more on buying positive magazine reviews then actually developing this product.     If I open the app, my vehicle status should already be available.  It's not FB, if it's idle I'm not using it, if I open it, it should check my vehicle status automatically..     The Remote start schedule fails 80% of the time. It should be a alarm, with a \"start or No Start\" selection WITHOUT opening the app. Or just start the dang car. Why have a schedule if I have to do the work anyway?.    This only works with Google wear? If that's all you got DI, you need a better IT director,  yours still drives a dinosaur to work.   The Vehicle status is lacking. You should be able to see more. Temp? Fuel? Trans? Nope. And those are easy sensors to tap into.     The status menu should have better visuals. Green for good, yellow for error,  red for alarm ect.  Instead everything is black with a dumb yellow line under it. I'm not reading a technical manual, I'm just quick glancing, make things user friendly.   This app works, but don't expect your 70$ a year to feel worth it. DI has failed to impress.",

Some of our team experience the video portion racing in fast motion ahead of the audio. Even with a large bandwidth and no other users, the videos will often stop several times through the five minute limit. I have timed the length it takes and averaged it out. 14 minutes is the average, to completely get through a  five minute post. I feel generous giving three stars.",

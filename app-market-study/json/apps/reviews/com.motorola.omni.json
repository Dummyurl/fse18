I had to install Google Fit just so I could track my other workouts. The heart rate tracker seems fairly consistent and accurate, which is a plus. Recently I have noticed that my active burn calories have not been recording at all. Even after exercising for an hour, I sit at \"0 active calories burned\". I do not rely on the calorie counter, so this is more of annoyance since it used to work.",

Counts activity when I'm sitting still and ignores even when it says the rate is 135. One morning I was biking for 45 minutes, Google Fit -- which uses the same sensor -- showed an average rate of 96bpm and as much as 145bpm and this moronic program said I only had 5 minutes of \"activity\". If I had no heart activity, I'd be dead.",

Though I would like to see in future updates possiblity to turn on/off more items on screen. Like digital watch, compass points etc. Also icons for shortcuts would be great.  Watch crashed once after installing this, but hopefully that was only one and last time it does this. But gonna keep using this and see how our life together goes. =)",

        "comment": "Had my Moto 360 Gen 1 for almost 2 years now and this is the 1st watchface email I've ever bought so I really wanted to like it, did my research and jumped in.  Unfortunately, seems to chew through battery life like crazy. Thought it was the weather refresh so I changed it to every 24 hours, still uses what I consider an excessive amount of power.  Had it on the first time anxiety within 9 hours I had 20% battery life left.  Restarted my phone and watch, charged to 100% and 7-8 hours later 34% left.  Don't get me wrong, design and appearance is great which is why I  decided to make it my first purchase, just need the battery life last longer. On my usual watchface I still have about 40% left after a 15 hour day. With an estimated life of about 31 hours.   Sorry really wish it would've been different.",

The notifications are currently overlapping with the bottom part of the watch face.       3. Add the option to disable the notification card on the watch face, but only when on ambient mode. A few other watch faces have this option, and I really like it.",

        "comment": "Great watch face with a really nice subtle animation when waking it.  One major gripe though: When an hour has past, the hour hand will stick only to the current hour exactly. i.e. if it's 1:30pm, the hour hand will be at 1 sharp, instead of inbetween 1 and 2. This fixes itself when it wakes, but is very jarring and repeats.",

The only problem is that it tends to crash quite frequently and doesn't reboot itself the next time I wake up the watch (that might just be a Android Wear thing). I have to set a different watchface and then switch back to Mango to get it back, which shouldn't be a thing because like a real watch, the face has to just stay there without becoming a distraction to the watch itself.",

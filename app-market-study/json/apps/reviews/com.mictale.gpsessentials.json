As my list of waypoints increased it was becoming increasingly tedious to select a way point from a list, until I realised there was a brilliant option to select way points via google maps. Unfortunately, using this option the app was randomly switching waypoints during navigation which was very annoying. Still a good app but unfortunately no longer for me.",

But when I check after some time the mobile screen is off and the app stopped tracking speed and distance. I love this app and using since long time but this time I am frustrated because of this app. I suggest you to improve this app for running in background so that when mobile is locked, the app should still run and track speed in the background.",

Twice now I opened the app to use it and found all my info that I had saved gone!  Most recently I lost over 2 years worth of saved locations.",

        "comment": "Nice app, and so far it is the best app like this yet. The UI feels clunky, and is awkward to figure out, and I wish I could download full maps because on the off chance that I didn't prescreen where I was going to have the ma cached, I'm kinda screwed. [maybe allow a base map download, and just catch higher zooms?]",

The PDF manual is not a great help and is a bit out of date. With  rework of the UI etc. it could be much better.",

        "comment": "This app is extremely frustrating.  The user interface is far from intuitive.  I wanted to simply enter a GPS coordinate and then use the compass to guide me to it.  I was unable to find any way to simply enter the coordinates as a waypoint, let alone then activate it as the target for the compass.  I am dubious that anyone would actually find this confusing app that useful.",

        "comment": "It often stops tracking in the background which kind of makes it utterly useless as GPS tracker, and gets reaaallllly laggy with larger tracks (25km with the car was plenty on my Xperia z5). Also can't edit my SmartWatch dash. It also would be nice to have an option to download a selected area so portable maps are /actually/ portable without manually having to scroll through the map at specific zoom levels to cache them. Would buy the app if it worked better, but for now I'll judge it as a free app.",

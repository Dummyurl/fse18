Using Watchmaker watch faces sometimes lead to forxed exiting from the HRM app. This probably was due to overpowering the watch's hardware capabilities. If various interval settings, as in workout profiles, could be saved I'd give it 5 stars. Sound instead of vibration would be good, too.",

But you have to manually set up your intervals every time you use it, which makes it completely useless. It will only be usable when it becomes possible to define and store interval configurations on the phone and select them on the watch.",

Otherwise, it's perfect for timing breaks in the gym.",

However it has a fatal flaw - it is completely inaccurate if the display is either off or on the 'standard clock' mode. I've timed it with a stop watch and it looses significant time.   I was using it to time for an exam - however it is off by about 12 minutes by the end of the exam! Useless.   I've also emailed the developer and have had no response.   It's a shame as it could be very good.   If the inaccuracy is fixed I'd love to give it five stars.",

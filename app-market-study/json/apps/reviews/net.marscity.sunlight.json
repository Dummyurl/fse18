It's a great example of how to pack a huge amount of data on a tiny screen while keeping it functional AND elegant! Definitely worth whatever initial price, and the additional data subscriptions are very reasonable.",

Deserved to be a 5 star app, so why only have I only given 3? A few reasons, firstly as it has a bug that loses/doesn't update the forecast data after every 3 days, only way round it is to reinstall the phone app! I appreciate it may not affect everyone but despite leaving a bug report and contacting developer via email, he hasn't replied.  The developer also stated that the 2 other weather providers will return in a few weeks but so far nothing. I don't mind too much but may affect others where DarkSky isn't the most reliable forecaster.  There are also plenty of other small improvements that could be made, would like to see a bigger clock option on the ambient screen. The text across the middle when changed to the agenda doesn't support all day appointments. I could go on, however despite the lower rating it's been my everyday watchface since I bought it as it's unique at what it does and is worth the hassle of the reinstalls regardless.",

The only reason I deduct a star is because here on the Oregon Coast, AccuWeather is the only weather source we can trust. I find the \"Wordweatheronline\" option to be the closest to accurate of the two options currently available. It's still \"off\" enough that I must pull out my phone for the most accurate weather info.",

It's a little odd to see an unfinished app update over one that felt complete (that's what beta programmes are for! \ud83d\ude1c). Still, what IS there is great: things like the subtle complication ranges on the edge (which default to phone and watch battery), and support for complication providers (as well as being one itself)... and that's just some of what's new!  (thought I'd update the review to be a bit more positive because the dev reply got me thinking that there wasn't much that really disappeared in the 2.0 update, just a few new things that are placeholders)",

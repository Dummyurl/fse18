It's not so easy to dismiss this alarm. I wake up feeling more refreshed and it doesn't wake my wife up. Great job!",

My only real suggestion, have an option for a larger font current time that is shown when the alarm is going off.  It's a bit small for sleepy / blurry eyes in the morning.",

It monitored your sleep and woke you when you were in a light sleep versus a deep sleep; inside a certain window of time from your chosen wake up time. When I got my new Moto 360 that was something I missed most. While the stock alarm is fair - it is not good and glitches quite often. This app is the answer. It does a great job and wakes me up with no problems. The dev is quick to answer questions and I think it is well worth",

My partner and I like the fact that it vibrates on my wrist, and not an annoying alarm clock, as she works odd hours. Only downside is, I'm used to charging my watch when I sleep, why only 4 stars. I did donate the $1.03 so they can improve it! I think it has great potential.",

Otherwise a great alarm for android wear and I'm using it as my default alarm now.",

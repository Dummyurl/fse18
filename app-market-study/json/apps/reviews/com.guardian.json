The readers' comments range from insightful and thought provoking to the myopic and poorly written. I enjoy the ability to add my voice to the cacophony. Reading the Guardian is  pleasure, though what I read often makes me sad or angry. For the times we live, the voice of the Guardian is a beacon of freedom. It must never be allowed to be extinguished.",

Even when i ask for the ad to be removed, the space where the ad was is still obstructing the article making it unreadable. I don't mind ads that are in-line with your article, but when it covers the article and impedes reading it does not make me want to use your app- let alone continue making contributions. Please fix and I'll increase the star rating and continue making contributions.",

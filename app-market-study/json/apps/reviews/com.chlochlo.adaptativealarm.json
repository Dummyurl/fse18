I gave it 4 stars because the developer was really response to my questions and concerns and I'm really excited about his future plans for this app. I think with a couple updates that this will be a 5 star, goto alarm app in the near future.",

        "comment": "Very responsive developer and seems to really take suggestions into account. The alarm app, is becoming a VERY viable alternative to alarm clock extreme. My suggestion is more options for challenges (i.e. for math: customized difficulty and setting certain number of challenges to dismiss). If more types of challenges get added, it would be awesome if it could randomly show you different ones (i.e. math, captcha, simon-like pattern, etc). But as it stands right now, still my absolute favorite alarm app!",

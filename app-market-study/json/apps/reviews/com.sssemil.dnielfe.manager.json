For example, I get an annoying pop-up that keeps me from using the app, that says something along the lines of, \"Please wait for your watch to synchronize, thanks :)\"  At first this was just annoying, because it is an all-white screen that prevents me from \"simply exploring\" my files. However, when I try to grep the source code linked to for any such \"watch\" reference, I can't find it.  Which I can only assume means this app is in the PlayStore with a fork that is not actually open sourced.",

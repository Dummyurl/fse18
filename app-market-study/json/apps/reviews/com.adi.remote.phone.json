Please notify me if you add my component models to the supported list. BUMMER!",

Edit: after a lot of fiddling with battery settings etc I found that the actual fix was:  Settings. Apps. Special access. Optimise.select app. turn off.

Only channel control don't work since that's controlled by the cable box not TV. But that's not the apps fault.   Model number is: UN50KU630DFXZA Version No: DG10. EDIT: TV comes up as D-series for some reason but D-series on the app doesn't connect to the TV, so I connected as K-series (TV purchased in Dec 2016). That worked but dropped the connection later. Reconnected as M-series and that seemed to work but start getting notices when I turned on the TV that a new HDMI connection existed every time I turned on the TV. not sure if that was App related but it went away when I stopped using the app. Will give it one more try.",

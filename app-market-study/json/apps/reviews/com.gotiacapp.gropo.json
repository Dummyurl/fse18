Decent app gets a little finicky connecting sometimes, and I've noticed the record on/off command doesn't always sync with the camera, even when the app thinks it has.  Also, the modes cycle properly, but the camera always turns off when I try to change settings like resolution and fov.  App is usable, but could certainly stand some help.",

The phone app just sets the camera name and password (gives no feedback as to success). Installing the phone app simultaneously installs a watch app. Go look for it.",

I can connect my gopro (hero3 black) to the phone and to the smartwatch (sony  SW3), I tryed all the variants - but the app doesn' connect to the gopro. I've fill gopro name and password in the phone part of app, then press accept - it says \"Guardado\" - and that's all. The oficial gopro app in the phone works fine. What should I du to connect gopro tu SW?  UPD: I got connection, but it doesn't 'work properly - changes video resolution to wrong one (not choiced), and after some setting changes (didn't find what depends on, but mostly when swiched to 1080p30) it hangs my gopro, so it shows wrong info on the LCD and doesn't response right (software or camera buttons), only battery disconnectiong helps, camera goes to default settings then. Seems not frendly to gopro3",

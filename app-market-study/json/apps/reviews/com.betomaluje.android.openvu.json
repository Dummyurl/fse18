The developer explained that the watch isn't android wear but tizen so sadly it won't work properly. But it also doesn't work with my new smart watch 3 by Sony. No watch faces to select or anything....I paid 2$ before this was free the creater did refund my money but I would like to see the 12 hour clock option as well",

This automatically removes that light based on the time of day and helps me sleep much easier. Heck on the first night of use I had an enjoyable dream which may be a coincidence but Holy. Cow. Awesome sleep. Helped me wake up energized and fall asleep easily. I recommend it. Ye.",

The only complaint I have, is that the navigation bar on my phone isn't covered. I have a Droid Turbo 2. Other than that, I'm quite happy with this app and I have definitely felt the difference when reading late at night. I have less headaches and wake up feeling more alive than I did perviously. Fantastic app and I recommend it for everyone!",

But with using this apps settings of 1000k relaxing, intensity 50%, and screen dim 30%; I've noticed a huge difference. I wish I had started using this sooner! We need sleep, and this app actually helps with that (if you usually use your phone at night)",

Other games aren't much affected from this..",

        "comment": "This is the best app for screen dimming on Android. You can set a custom schedule if you work a late shift so it won't dim until 2am or 3am.  But the one thing that would make it better, to leave the blacks as dark as possible without reducing the contrast by making black kinds of red, is not something any app on Android can do. Not sure why, but it's a disadvantage of the Android platform.   Twilight does night mode better than any other app I've found, so it's what I'm sticking with.",

When I unlock my screen, it gets paused and I return to a brightness I was not prepared for. I then have to go and turn it back on. This is really disappointing since this app until now has been flawless and is my most used app on my phone. Reading at night is just not the same without it. Hoping for a fix to this issue in an upcoming update.  EDIT: Developer was very helpful and this issue was resolved by accessing my phone settings and changing the lock permission of this app!",

        "comment": "Does exactly what it needs to. The persistent notification is annoying but that's an OS problem. I like that you can control it from quick tiles but the only problem is that the tile only pauses the app but doesn't stop it. I paid for the unlock in hopes that the quick tile would stop the app and the notification would go away but it doesn't. You have to manually open the app and stop it. Rather annoying. Especially because I could've done that without paying for it.",

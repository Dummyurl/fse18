More than once, though, it has indicated that I hadn't moved for quite a while immediately after doing something that should qualify as moving in my mind, such as going out and playing fetch with the dog, or carrying laundry down and starting a load.  It does catch bigger things, like taking a walk or exercise class, so it makes me wonder what the threshold is.",

Many times when commuting to work, I will be on the freeway for a while, hit my exit, and get a congratulations for being active 20 minutes. So, this still does the one thing nothing else in does, and gives me inactivity reminders, and I'll use Google Fit to track my actual steps.",

But, it is because I have been standing mostly in one place for a while perhaps. If I sit on the couch too long, it works almost every time. It seems to help it, like they say in the directions, try to keep it in your pocket. Overall, they really have something. As far as I know, there is no purely phone based sitting alert app out there.",

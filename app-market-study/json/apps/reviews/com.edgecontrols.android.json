Also, ambient mode does not match the controlled brightness (at least not when turned down low). Other than those two things I like it a lot! I think I'll keep it since it appears the dev cares about the app and might make it better :-)",

I can turn the brightness down below factory allowance, which is why I was looking for an app. The reason I picked this one is that it works on any screen. I tend to like the brightness down very low in dim environments, I've had trouble in the past leaving the brightness on my phone too low and going out in the morning and can't see enough to turn the brightness back up. When using this app I'm not sure if I'm accidentally turning on auto mode as the previous commenter mentioned, but each time I want to use it I have to turn it off and back on again to get it functioning. If that problem is resolved I would give the app 4 stars... 5 if it could control the ambient screen!",

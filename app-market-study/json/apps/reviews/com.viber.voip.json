So, after restoring from backup you have text messages only (hi, I'm sending you a great shot!) but photos are missing, only ugly black squares, broken thumbnails links, etc... a complete mess! WhatsApp makes FULL chat backup on GDrive from years! So, I'm disappointed, no more than 3 points...",

        "comment": "I came into contact with this app, over 5 years ago, from a close friend who's Australian. It was the best and cheapest form of communication to us and it worked effectively. Some time afterwards, I came off to use WhatsApp and that was it ever since then. However I have returned because I desire to be away from WhatsApp for good; too many distractions and nuisances.  I must say that Viber is even better than it was at last and I am really enjoying it. There are less folks here, that I know from my contact list who uses this and it's what the been looking for. The video calling could be better and the voice notes shouldn't be limited: that all that I have concerns with, but overall I'm rating it better than WhatsApp and that's according to my standards. It is really a good and stable app and the voice calls are much better than WhatsApp from my experience and in my books.   Kudos and thanks to the developers for such a great and stable app, that has been out for years and is still working towards improvements, for a better and more enjoyable experience. Keep at it, you've been doing well ever since!",

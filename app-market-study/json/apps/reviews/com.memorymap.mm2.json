Only reason im not giving it 5 stars is it need a night mode, even with the screen dimmed it is too bright to use in the car at night. Also a line from current location to waypoint shown on the map as the direction to arrow is  a pain to use.",

If your app is out of date or the android has updated, then the background map will not show fully or at all. If you are in the middle of nowhere (no signal) then it is too late to update the app. This feature causes problems. You need the map area in your phone that you are in or this does not work, unless you like working off the road map. As the whole of GB maps are a large size - GB HD is over 28GB - an SD Disk with exFAT formatting is required and unfortunately there are not many phones that do this. The GPS lock is very useful and immediately lets you know your position. The saved files are good and go straight into your PC program. Overall, very good when it works, a pain when it does not.",

I've rated it 5 star because it is so good to have proper OS maps on my phone and be able to log box breadcrumb tracks etc. However there is still room for improvement. As someone else commented, the map licencing is weird and the interface is also a bit eccentric. For example having to wrestle to get the data tab open and then having to drag this right down to find the button to start logging - this is bizarre, why not just put this on the menu? There are a few other annoying quirks like this, but overall it is just so good to have proper maps (no disrespect to Google maps intended), but OS maps are iconic, so 5 stars it is, but could still be better.",

        "comment": "On a recent trip had to reboot phone and on restarting the app it hung looking for a network signal. Same is true on a campsite with limited network. It just hangs on startup making it totally useless unless you have internet. Which is tricky if you're in the hills. Coupled with the irritating zoom which bounces about and wont settle where you set it,  missing features like elevation plots or proper route planning and details, leaves this as nothing but a very expensive home based map browsing toy.",

The desktop app has hardly changed either. Shoddy :-(  Memory-map Inc.: your business will fail unless you spend some money on this, but it appears to me that is what you want as you can't be bothered with this.  In the absence of a response from the developers, I would suggest that no one subscribes or pays for this app. Shame, but there you go.",

It has many aids very sophisticated  but can be used simply to tell how much water is u Der the keel. Have used all the navigation feathers and after a learning period it is so good at helping navigate an entered course. I use it on an Android 8 inch pad and would be interested in an add on module to connect to a NEMA 2000 NETWORK. DON'T know how this would work but am very interested.",

However like many things it has improved over time, so much so that I recently purchased the entire UK 1:25000 maps! On my new phone and also my tablet it works a treat. Only thing on my wishlist is a visible scale option to give me a clue of distance which is otherwise difficult to determine,  especially when zoomed in.",

        "comment": "It could be so much better!  There needs to be an option to align to North (apparently this causes problems for marine nav but it greatly reduces functionality for walking). The GPS lock icon is too large.    You need to be able to see one synced track at a time (the only option is all or nothing).  If you have several tracks synced you can't tell which is which!  Discovered the full map doesn't fully download in the field with no mobile signal - apparently it can be done in a long-winded way, rather than a 'download full map' button.  Cloud sync is severely restricted unless you pay more money - would have been nice to know before buying a map.  I've an expired demo map and a bought map of the same area.  If I scroll out, it defaults to the expired / pixellated one with an option to activate, but apparently not one to delete it.  There doesn't appear to be an option to display the OS grid reference, just long/lat.  You can only choose portrait or landscape mode as you start - again, giving the option would be useful.  On the positive, HD maps are really clear.",

However something went wrong with some of the last updates, and tracking  does not work (on the same phone as last 2 years- Samsung Galaxy6) it only shows  lifting up and does not capture skiing down metrics. Only first slope max speed is recorded, but it is incorrect. Also distance is incorrect. Also noticed that backups from previous years have wrong calendar  dates.   Will reinstall and give a try tomorrow, maybe something went wrong with setup.  === Works fine after reinstall. 5 stars are back. Note for Samsung phone users: disable power saving, else GPS does not work.",

I restart it, only to get 1-2 more runs before it pauses again. At the end of a day my 20 run day shows 5 runs. I see other friends posting their days, so maybe it's some interaction with my Oneplus 5? I'll keep trying for now with the hope that it gets resolved.",

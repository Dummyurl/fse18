I completely understand the need for ads and am more than willing to watch them but when it takes me 2 hours to watch a 1 hour program because it keeps freezing when the ads start...unacceptable. Ads are how you get paid if you get anything right don't you think that should be it",

I restart my app atleast 4 times every episode because it'll freeze half way through the ads or wont stop playing ads.

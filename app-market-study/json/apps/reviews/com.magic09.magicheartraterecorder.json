The regular monitoring function works perfectly and the level of control over frequency of measurements and accuracy is great. If you want to use sport mode ensure that the measurement accuracy is set to standard or low to allow for rapid updates. Using OnePlus3 + LG Urbane  EDIT: edited review after developer contacted me and solved the issue of slow update rates in sport mode - which in itself shows great support from the developer :-)",

It'd be nice if it was bypassed completely, if possible.   2 Google Now Cards cannot be assigned to a button. Again, if possible, it'd be a nice addition.   Still running version one of Android Wear.",

So far I was only able to test Android Wear 2.0 in my emulator, but good news there is no such animation there. Clyde: Please email me, I have questions about Google Now Feed. You can try the new beta version: please see bottom of Play Store page.",

The one thing to note is that it took a while for this to show up on my watch but it did show up and was as simple as assigning it to one of the two button on my Zenwatch 3.",

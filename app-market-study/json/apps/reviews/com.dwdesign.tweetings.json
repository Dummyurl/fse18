So me pressing the RT Button a second time to \"delete\" that RT from my profile does not work. I'm steaming my tweets via Mobile Data. So I'm not pulling to refresh for Twitter Limits so I'm not sure why it's giving me that Bad Request 403.   Anyway ReTweeted Tweet on my profile? I tap the 3 dots on the tweet that I re-tweeted and there's no way to Delete that tweet on my profile.",

I moved all of my Twitter activity (I run, or assist on, four accounts) to this app when the devs of another app I used suddenly quit responding to help requests for an extended period. By contrast, I just had a problem with the app at the unholy hour of 2:45am -- and by 2:54am I had a response saying to try reinstalling. The reinstall worked. The devs do care about their app and are quick to implement fixes to issues that are more complex (like the recent time when searching for an entity's Twitter name ended up crashing the app -- a fix was deployed within hours). Also, ability to edit tweets is a huge win. Overall, I have no qualms about recommending this app to anyone looking to manage one or multiple Twitter feeds.",

        "comment": "I love the idea behind this app, but I'm also having the issue where the incoming call shows up on the screen, but no ringing/audio. The incoming call screen shows up for me even if the screen is locked/off, but just no ringing.   I realize this is an early version so I'm going to keep the app for a while and hope that this bug gets resolved, because this app could be very useful! Thanks!",

Just delivers a notification that can only be read once you've unlocked your phone and accessed it via the notifications menu. Plus it needs shorter 'call' delays. 10 or even 5 seconds. Uninstalling until this is working properly.",

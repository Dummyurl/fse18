Update: I've tried to contact wink support and they said that they do not handle support for third-party applications the support that I need would need to come from your support group, which I have sent 3 emails to with no reply! I am using a wink Hub 2 and they did however want to know what kind of authorization token you are using they said you should be using 0Auth2 not sure if this is the case. I will change my rating of this apps once it is all fixed.",

        "comment": "This app was very the best of the market until it's beginning to be a cash machine...  Why do we need to pay a monthly fee for services that we don't need... I have to find now an alternative solution even if I bought it on several devices for different domotic usage. This sales strategy is far away of the initial spirit. I'm afraid that interoperability benefits will disappear soon. The key added value of this app was to be autonomous and not cloud service dependant but with the capability to use internet services. I hope that they will react and they will offer solution which pro features without mandatory internet services like smart city.  The one shot cost should stay the core price model with optional internet service subcription... If not this app will disappear and will be substituted by a website as it's really cheaper...",

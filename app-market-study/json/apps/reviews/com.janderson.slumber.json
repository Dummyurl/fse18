I usually have to open the app, deselect then select the \"on\" feature. Is there something in the way of timing or the sensor that's causing the issue? When it works, it does work properly.",

It seems that once it's set you need to have the screen on before you place it in the holder. If the screen is off it does not work.  Also make sure the app shows the check mark. I also was able to just say start slumber and it showed the app with the check mark. Placed it in the charger and the screen is dark.",

I didn't really see any need to light up the screen with the clock and charge level, especially if there was a chance of screen burn in.  It's not an alarm clock after all.  I use the Gentle Alarm app on my Moto X and use it for my alarm clock on my nightstand  and it has a night display setting with anti burn in setting.",

        "comment": "- Install the Slumber app.  - Open the app from the watch. Should be fine if you open the app using any launchers too.  - Make sure a tick is seen, this indicates the screen will go blank.  - You can close the app or leave it open, doesn't matter.  - Put it on the charging dock. Screen will go blank.   Note - Even if you touch the screen slightly while it is docked it will display the info. If you leave it on dock after any screen touch watch will not go blank. Sometimes the first time you place on dock it will not go blank.  You will have to undock and redock till the watch goes blank. Usually will happen on the second try for sure.",

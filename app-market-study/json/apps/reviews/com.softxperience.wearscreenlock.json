        "comment": "Seems to work pretty well.  The only problem is that it is a pain to lock and unlock it.  You can do it with your phone, which sucks, or you can turn it upside down which doesn't work all the time.  It would be nice if there was a swipe pattern to unlock it or something that worked a bit better.  Other than that, it does exactly what it says and keeps me from accidentally changing the watch face all the time.",

End of the month I can see when and how many were used. 4 stars because there is no automatic backup function. And I would like a default month summary view. Again, this is the only counter which does more than count. I tried loads. Good work",

A minor gripe with the Android wear app is that it doesn't work standalone and also when I press + on my watch the number stays the same but updates right away on the phone. It's only when I restart the watch app that I see the updated tally. It would be great to see the increasing tallies as soon as I enter them on the watch. Happy to support developing this amazing utility! Thanks - LG Watch Sport and Note3.",

I don't mind the ad at the bottom of the main screen, but all the ones behind every click are really irritating.   Free version doesn't have enough features for me to make a determination on whether to pay the full $3.49 to unlock all features. I don't want to spend $.99 to remove ads when there isn't any other functionality.   Like another reviewer said, if you want to count the four default things then the free version may work for you. Oh and if you don't mind audio ads playing every time you click anything.",

I've been seeing this guy popping up on all kinds of apps in their feeds named Tom Steyer and he's trying to get people to sign a petition for people to impeach president Trump! I don't think people want to see this political garbage he's putting out there on our feeds in our apps! I sure don't and if it continues I'll be forced to uninstall this app or any others i see this trash in! \ud83d\ude12",

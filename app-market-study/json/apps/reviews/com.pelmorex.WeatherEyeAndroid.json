As a surface weather observer,  I would be alot more inclined to use it, if I didn't have to use this, then navigate environment Canada, when it really could just be together.   An easy 5 stars from me if this was done  Always selects wrong location   has proper permissions",

Edit: After the update that was supposed to improve navigation I am still disappointed with the navigation. The customizable layout that was previously used was still much more functional then the present layout. The accuracy of the app is still good.",

This used to be the best but now the WORST. 30-03-17 This the worst version. This app used to be the best... Now crashed while viewing the weather forecast. Still crashes (black screen)  when reading the news section. I've sent many feedback concerning this problem. Is anyone reading these feedbacks and rating? This has been occurring since the latest version of this app. I may have to select a different app in the futur if this problem isn't corrected. The previous version used to work so well. Seems this is going backwards. Let's go into a better futur. Thank you. Revision 5/03/17 Seems your updates isn't correcting the actual problems. I suspect the feedback isn't working also. It doesn't sppear that anyone from Weather Network is reading these feedbacks. No wonder people get angry. I am very patient but there are limits. Please respond or correct the problems. Thank you.",

I even get warnings about this unstable app slowing down my phone due to continuous crashes from malwarebytes. The new format is difficult to use, is very slow loading and doesn't give the details clearly like the old one. Used to be able to see what the day was hourly with precipitation amounts.  It also frequently crashes to a blue screen.",

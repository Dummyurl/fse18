        "comment": "Nice looking watch face on my LG watch R. Still has a few issues such as the tide heights are off by a consistent 0.2m (too low) vs other tide sources. Tide times seem to be consistent.   Wind speeds don't work, never shows more than 3knots.  Swell heights seem reasonable vs other data sources and what I have observed.  I'm using it for locations in Western Australia.  I would like to see the date & day squeezed on to the face somewhere to make it more general purpose.",

Beaches that I have tried (e.g., Bondi in Sydney, Australia) won't display wind speeds or direction, despite that data being available on the surfline website.  In its current state it is still very nice.",

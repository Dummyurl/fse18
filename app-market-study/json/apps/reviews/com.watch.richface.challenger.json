It was happily lettinge do this before connecting the companion app. Also there are no screen taps showing at all on the screen, as though it is no longer interactive. The screen lock is still showing unlocked, it has never worked!",

The way the menu displays information where the digital clock is located is a nice touch.  I hope the developer will continue to update this watch face with more features in the future such as removing the word \"menu\" and just keeping the logo. The ability to change watch hands or being able to edit the watch face straight from our watches like some of the other richface watch faces.  Keep up the great work!",

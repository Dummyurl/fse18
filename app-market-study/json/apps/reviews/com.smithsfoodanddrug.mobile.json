You should also be allowed to make changes to your order within the first hour of it being placed. I wanted to remove some items I didn't need about 15 minutes after placing my order and was told it was too late, this is inconvenient since it was 7a.m. and I'm not picking my order up until 7 tonight.    &gt;&gt;&gt;So very slow, it doesn't matter if I use data or wifi. Please fix it. I have to do the click list on the computer because the app is so painfully slow. Unresponsive all morning. I give up. Every time I try to search for an item it takes so long to load, and then I receive an \"unresponsive script\" *notice. Nothing else on my phone is having this problem, this is my first time using the app for grocery(pick up) service and I can't even complete the list.",

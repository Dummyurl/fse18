I think this app, along with Michael Herger's continued support of LMS will keep my fantastic Squeezebox music ecosystem at the heart of my home listening for many years to come (well until the hardware dies).  Excellent, responsive developer support as well.",

Free Squeezer nearly did it, but searches for tracks etc. on Tidal gave results matching \"Query\" instead of the contents of the Query variable inside the app. This app returned query results as expected. And it has great functionality, including a sleep timer. Purchasing a good app makes sense; the challenge is finding good ones before comitting bucks. Cheers!  Update 2017.04.19 : Just installed my 3rd Raspberry Pi (a model 3), this one having a HiFiBerry DAC+ daughter card. With Logitech Media Server running on an old desktop over Ubuntu server, I use this app to control the Pi's. This morning I tried syncronizing two players at different locations within the house ... worked flawlessly!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. Considering the cost of Sonos and Bluesound gear, the price of the app is 'peanuts'!",

Worth the money to extend the ease of use for my aging squezebox. If you notice any issues with the app, try replicating the action with the Logitech online remote.  You may find its the player not the remote.  It may just be me, but it seems much more user friendly than the Logitech remote and seems like it allows me to do more actions (or just easier to figure out how to do it)",

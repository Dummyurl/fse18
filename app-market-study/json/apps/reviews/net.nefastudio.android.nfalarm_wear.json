        "comment": "The built in alarm function in Android Wear just wasn't flexible enough but this certainly meets my needs - particularly the ability to suspend rather than delete an alarm. The interface isn't the prettiest and the 'retro'' digital watch appearance is definitely not to my taste but it does the job and I'll stick with it in the hope it'll be given a face-lift before too long.  Edited to add, it took me a while to work out how to add labels to alarms I'd set but, now I know how it's done (long press on the entry in the Alarm Listing on the mobile app) I'm happy with the way it works.  I'm just left with cringing over the app's appearance on the watch.  Other than that, it's all good!",

Changing something on the phone doesn't change it on the watch. New alarms set on the watch with 'phone only' setting still rings only on wear. The app isn't handling timezones well so when I'm travelling if I set the alarm then it sets the value in my corresponding home timezone on the phone while the correct timezone is used on the watch etc.",

Something like... \"OK google,  show alarms.... set alarm for 10am daily\". Phone side alarm tone wont change from silent no matter what tone I choose(minor). This means that while alarms do play the chosen sound you won't see which you previously selected since the selection box always starts at the first entry (silent on my phone).",

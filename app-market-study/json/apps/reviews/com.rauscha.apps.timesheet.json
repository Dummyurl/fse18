Cons: - Limited filtering of tasks (billing status only). - Inability to navigate from pie chart to actual tasks that make up slices. - Lack of tag and project timeline report (how metric changes over time).",

If I forget to clock in and go back and edit the time, the automatic break after \"x\" hours is based on the original time I clocked in not the edited time.  This is a minor annoyance and I would still recommend this app to all",

Or timed exercises where you have to stop hit the button just to record that 30 or 60 sec movement.... Didnt fix the issue till have to stop to push a button will stay with my other BETTER workout app",

Only criticism is maybe containing alternate exercises in workouts? This is due to long queues often forming for machines in many gyms thus breaking the workout up into rests that are too long.

I'm not going to pay for an app that has erroneous reporting, and a technical support staff who seems too disinterested in helping fix a service that I'm paying for. Coupled with the fact that I am penalized for not using real time logging and don't get my points. I would use real time logging, but after spending time on a routine and then noticing that it has disappeared when I go to log my workout live, I then have to use another app that I can count on with a staff that cares about their customers. It's a shame too, JEFIT would have been a 5star review, but the technical problems and treatment from staff just make this a waste of time.",

It's be nice to set defaults of rep/weight adjustment while inside of the workout, instead of before it starts. Perhaps a \"save default\" check box while you're selecting your reps and weight for that exercise.",

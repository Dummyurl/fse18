There are dozens of interesting historical places and sites with neat architecture in my city, none of which are listed. Not sure if this is something that's being worked on, but for right now I don't see a point in using this app.",

Surely there must be more than just that, as the area is a major tourist destination which I agree is famous for whale watching,  however it is also the gateway to Fraser Island and the southernmost point of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is renowned across the world as a major tourist attraction.",

Make them tic boxes instead of all or nothing choices and this app is an eleven out of ten. Thanks for all your hard work nitanic labs. I love all that you do.",

There are plenty of locations not mentioned, and there are plenty of junk locations that are there instead. Also, they've partnered with a number of different web sites to bring this information to their app. Great. Why can't I pick one of the partners and only view theirs? For example one partner is Food Network. Why can't I view only Food Network's cards? Also, if I'm on blue tooth, I shouldn't have to tap read aloud. If I have a blue tooth it should automatically read it. According to the help page, it says I have to tap it. No. I'm really a bit disappointing. It has potential, but needs to move forward with better options and locations.",

A couple of things it needs is the ability to add content, or at least integration with the bank of Google Maps data that already exists. Secondly, it would be nice to be able to create \"tours\" for other people. Perhaps those thoughts come with their own liabilities, though.",

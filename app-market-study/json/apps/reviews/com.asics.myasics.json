It is true the GPS can be a bit hit and miss but after I I changed it to run in the background it was a lot better. I ran injury free and knocked 13 minutes off my predicted time. I would would highly recommended it. It's a pity that you lose the plans when you create a new plan.",

Unfortunately it doesn't sync my gps watch, i can't sync it to my calendar either (even though it states it can and I've tried and tried!) & when i wanted to share the plan with some running friends, the only option is via Facebook.  The designers need to re-think the whole set up of this app, as in principle, it could be so much better.",

Tried various scenarios, but it only jumps between sub 14min and 31min, both highly inaccurate. Why can't it just use the goal time like other programs? I'm an IronMan athlete hoping to improve my 5km run time. Don't see how the two are related. Very disappointed.",

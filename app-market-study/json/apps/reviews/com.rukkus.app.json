NOTHING  COMPARED TO  THE  NIGHTMARISH EXPERIENCE I HAD WHEN I USED VIVIDSEATS....THE FEES  WERE A LITTLE HIGH THOUGH.

BUT Unlike StubHub I was not able to automatically download the tickets, instead it said I was going to receive an email to print. Waited 2 hours with no email, I called to only get a voice mail & leave a message. This afternoon I get an email saying I was getting a refund because the tix were no longer available. BUT they are still 4 sale w/a higher price.",

After they collected my money those tickets magically weren't available and they tried to replace with seats no where near center ice but told me those seats cost more, like they're doing me a favor. When I realized that it's not what I ordered. I called then out on it. Terrible customer service. Lied about calling me back. I had to contact them to get a response.  Surprise, surprise. Nothing they could do. So I emailed them like I was suggested by their employee. I had their so call manager Patricia yell at me over the phone because I kept emailing them for a response. She was very aggressive. She would not let me talk or talk to her manager when I didn't want to speak to her because she kept yelling at me. She kept cutting me off. She called me a child. Very unprofessional. Super aggressive! After I got off the phone with her, I got a very aggressive email. So that's how they do their business. Sell you something that's not available, then stick you with something you don't want. Never once did anyone give me the option to cancel. But it's my fault, cause I made the mistake purchasing with them.",

        "comment": "DO NOT USE RUKKUS!!  Rukkus claims they have a \"Buyer Guarantee\" policy,  however, they did NOT stand by it after I purchased 2 concert tickets for $669. Rukkus failed to produce the 2 tickets I purchased after they realized that the tickets I purchased, that were listed on their website and I called to inquire/verify 3 times before I purchased were supposedly listed wrong??  I had researched several different ticket brokers attempting to get the best seats at the best price and not get taken advantage of.  2 of Rukkus employees verified the tickets that I was interested in & told me about their wonderful \"Buyer Guarantee\". Both reiterated the company's \"Buyer Guarantee\" policy, stating that Rukkus would locate another set of equal or similar value tickets, in a comparable location/section to the tickets that I had purchased as replacements if there were any problems with my tickets. RUKKUS claims this on their website, app and 2 of their employees actually told me on the phone. In the end Rukkus did NOT stand by their own guarantee policy, were rude, supervisor refused to let me speak with anyone else and I did not get my tickets!! DO NOT USE THEM!!!",

Also every site has taxes, and shipping,  and fee's. However on Rukkus not only were the seats cheaper  and the other combined costs were also. Thanks so much",

Rukkus told me too bad nothing they would do about it!  The seats i did get were fine, but i could have bought those same tickets for $17 each, so i paid almost double for tickets that should have been much closer.  Only thing they did that i appreciated was call back after my complaint, but their answered was, oops too bad, nothing we are going to do about it.  The Site doesn't have any type of history tracking so really tough to go back and look at what was done or ordered.  Customer Service said if i had a screen print of what i ordered they would be able to do something??  Disappointed, make sure you have a Screen print of your order to avoid any discrepancies.",

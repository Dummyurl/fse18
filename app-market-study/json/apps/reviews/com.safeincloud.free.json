        "comment": "As described, the best cross-platform Password Manager with cloud sync and free Desktop app. Fast cloud sync on Android, IOS, Mac and latest Windows 10. Can attach resized and cropped images (and files) and still smaller in size. Have imported from Keepass to save re-entry and plus pulls website icons easily. Bought the one-off payment  pro version as loving it so far. Best to install free one first to get the icon shortcut on mobile to open database as found you do not get this with pro install first. With fingerprint unlock and now expiry date (23 Feb 2018) too. Kudos to developer.",

An obscure old manager of mine was discontinued, so I had to switch. SIC was there only one that allowed straightforward import, and I looked at a few before making the jump. Worth the money for sync capabilities to PC.",

Only reason giving 4 instead of 5 stars is when you start with non pro, then pay, you still have to install via the non-pro installer..... the pro version still remains in Google play as \"buy\", giving the impression you haven't bought it. Not a major issue but shouldn't buying the app \"unlock\" the pro installer.... fix that, it goes 5 stars instantly from me :)",

It allows to modificaion of what data is stored by adding your own fields and organizing the order.   It has just enough structure as far as defining templates for websites,  credit cards, etc. without tying you in to theirs. I had an issue with syncing after  changing the password (which you have to do manually on every device using the database).  When I wrote in to the developers for support they responded in quick time frame with the answer.  I was able to fix it per their instructions and found out  the database and backups filenames to boot.  Knowing where they are stored makes me more comfortable in managing my own system and feeling that I will actually be able to restore in the event of a disaster crash.  That is something I worry about because when it is usually the first time you find out whether the restore works.  I have not tried it but at least knowing I have a backup file makes me a bit more confident.  NOTE that backups are not automatic.  You have to choose the backup command.  And I didn't even pay anything!",

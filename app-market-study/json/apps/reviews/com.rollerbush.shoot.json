That way the shutter sound can be an audio cue for when long exposure shots are done  - focus override slider should have a little toggle to switch back to autofocus. Also on my phone (LG G4), i dont seem to get any tap to focus  - viewfinder frame rate should not correlate to the shutter speed because for example if you do 10s exposure, the viewfinder freezes for 10s intervals. Other apps like Proshot and Open Camera also suffer this issue when trying to do long exposure",

For the current price its a no brainer and I am lucky that my LG Flex2 (5.1.1) supports the Camera2 API. However for me to actually use the app, it needs at least the following features: Auto HDR and Panorama mode and at least basic video recording. Also it does not seem to offer a way to save shots to SD card which in my case is a total nogo since my onboard memory is already almost full. Also the app itself cannot be moved to SD card, please change that!! The viewer that opens when I click on the shots doesnt offer a way to delete the pics or move between shots. Let me choose which viewer I want to use pls. Also an app exit button would be useful! ;) For the future the following would be great: Timelapse pictures, something similar to Super shots in the \"a better camera\" app, Barcode scanner, something similar to apples live videos and more advanced videorecording features (slowmo, 60fps, hyperlapse, video bitrate) or addon of filters like tilt shift etc I hope this app develops quickly and stays fast and stable, then I will change my rating",

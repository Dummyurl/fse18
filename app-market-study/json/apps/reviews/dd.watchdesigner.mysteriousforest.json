Love that you can change wether you want the stars twinkling or leafs blowing ect I've just downloaded so seeing how much battery it drains as mine never seems to hit below 80% in a day. Unless I'm reading wrong, it says my watch wouldn't support it being an s2 but it works beautifuly. Only gripe I have is that there's no date but all I've had to do is move the calendar so it's a case of turning my watch to see the date which isn't hard by any means",

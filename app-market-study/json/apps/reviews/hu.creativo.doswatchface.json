One issue I find on Moto 360 gen 2,when I go to change favorite watch faves in wear 2.0 the menu crashes, I have tested it by removing the app and it works fine when DOS watch is not installed.  Also the option to ronove the notification counter or turn it white with ambient mode would be nice.  Also the counter doesn't fit on the screen.  Plus an option to remove seconds in the main watch would be cool. I know I'm asking alot but just firing ideas.",

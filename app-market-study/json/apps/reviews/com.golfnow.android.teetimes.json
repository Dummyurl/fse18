I also don't like the fact that you have to book a rewards tee time 3 days in advance as I often decide to play a round last minute. Other than that I like the interface etc. so I gave it 4 stars.",

GolfNow basically just stole $160 from me for canceling 5 days in advance do the weather concerns. They canceled my reservation at the course but are not returning any of the money involved so they are charging me for basically nothing. I have escalated several calls up to management only to be told I could be sent some golf balls and have expiring credits I cannot use. It's 20\u00b0 out and raining not the most ideal conditions for a good game of golf. I didn't know a company like GolfNow could take your money for zero service provided! I will never use them again and advise all golfers not to either. # GolfNow",

It took me 10 minutes to find a contact phone number, even Google had a hard time finding it. Finally I called, and they were closed at 3:30 pm! What kind of business makes you work this hard just to speak with someone, and then be closed during normal business hours?! I thought I set my tee time via the golf course, didn't even know it used a 3rd party, and the golf course says I have to call Golfnow because they can't do anything. I should have called the course instead of using this worthless company that charged me $5.40 for nothing!!! Worst app EVER!",

Why not 1 day, why not just be blank? 3. You can't easily modify/cancel a reservation. 4. You will be on hold on the customer service number FOR EVER -- Obviously because of the MANY satisfied customers. 5. When I finally got to talk to someone in customer service, explaining my issue, he agreed to credit me for the reservations (after explaing it about 10 times) -- Guess what, I GOT NO CREDIT!!  HORRIBLE -- Will be deleting the app and never using it again.  I hate it so much, I doubt I'll be able to resist telling random people I play golf with (I have a flexible schedule, so yes, Golf Now folks, I often book tee times for the VERY NEXT DAY, not just 2 days out, and sometimes even sooner).  Hey GolfNow -- GET a clue, there's lot of better competition out there that doesn't spend all their money on marketing, like you obviously do.  Savvy consumers will find them and stop using your crappy service.",

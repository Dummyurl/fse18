I have no idea whether there's anything new as the order I'm shown it makes no sense. It's not for browsing any more, so I don't bother with it. Make it sequential again (like Twitter!) and maybe it'll be worth another go.",

For instance, the app uses so much memory that it can't properly save its state upon switching to another app, making you have to look for the post you were going to comment on when you come back. You, the user, go and search for the post in the search bar. You find the post and click it. What happens? The post is displayed in some kind of card, likely the mobile site on the system's web rendering engine. Comments are nowhere to be seen, and trying to add one does nothing. It's simply amazing.",

The only negative thoughts I have about FB is the connection between people who are listed on some one's friends list are also listed in the FB contacts of everybody on a person's friends list.   This is a hassle for the people who don't know that other person on a friend's list of friends.  That feature could be omitted or changed.",

I've had several unhandled exceptions which have resulted in termination. Your app is no good, your coding skills are no good and your business practices in selling information to China are plain disgusting. Have a nice day.",

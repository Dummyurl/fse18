Further suggestions: 1) Provide option to remove a program from the continue watching list. 2) Improve the suggestion system based off of previous reviews. This doesn't seem to work well at present. 3) Make programs more easily findable. Takes forever to find something to watch. Some good movies / series are on here but usually hard to find them.",

        "comment": "When using chromecast, automatically switches sound option to Dolby 5.1 stereo instead of just regular 5.1. Please give option to make default sound option.  Also in recent update, occasionally the picture will get severely pixelated as if a cable was broken to the TV and sending  poor signal. It's not a bad image quality issue, it's just a bunch of color and pixels (like a brown screen). Furthermore, it has been very buggy over WiFi and loses connection, even though YouTube or other streaming services are fine. Constantly shows error 5.2. Still an issue after latest update (2/3/18) V30",

And without the \"next episode\" button, i have to scroll through the long list of episodes to watch the new one. Don't know why it was removed shortly after it was implemented... Moreover the home buttons are stuck and won't go away. It's uncomfortable to immerse ourselves in what we're watching when there's a centimeter of buttons blocking a part of the screen.",

The only reason I didn't give one star is because it still has a few decent selections, but I'm probably gonna cancel my subscription soon",

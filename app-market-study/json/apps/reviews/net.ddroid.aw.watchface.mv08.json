        "comment": "Edit 3: I just realized that there has been changes in Android, so I had to install the face through the watch. After doing that, the face is working fine.  Edit 2: Even after the latest update, it still doesn't appear among watch faces.  Edit 1: I purchased LG V30 about a month ago. I had LG G6 before that and the watch face was working fine. But on V30 it doesn't show up in Android Wear. Please fix   Original review: It is a great face, but needs improvements. I have two suggestions. First, make UTC time changeable so that user can select a second location for it other than UTC.  Second, the analog clock that shows UTC time, it's better to find something else for it. Right now it seems that the author didn't know what to put there, so he/she just put a clock there which is redundant. Other than that, it is fantastic.",

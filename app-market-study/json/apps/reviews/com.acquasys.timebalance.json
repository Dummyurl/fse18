Anything set for a week though does not work. For example: task set for 1 hour a week. 20 minutes Monday, 10 minutes Tuesday, and so on - the task will not go green when I have accumulated an hour. Alternatively, more than an hour on Monday - goes green for that day, but then returns to red on Tuesday even though completed  week's task. PLEASE FIX THIS.",

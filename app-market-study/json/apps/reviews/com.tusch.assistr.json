Also it asks me multiple times if my WiFi is a trusted device. After I say yes and confirm my pin, it forgets it and then asks again. Can't believe I spent money on this. How do I get a refund?",

It seems to have no idea when I am and am not connected to a trusted Bluetooth device, so even when I'm connected to my smart watch out Bluetooth headphones, it asks for a pin. I installed this app to make using and unlocking my phone easier, but it has been nothing more than a complete nuisance. At best it's not particularly user friendly; at worst, it's a complete failure. It doesn't override the security settings of my phone so even when it reports that my Bluetooth device is connected and that the phone is unlocked, I still need to use the phone's default pin or pattern to unlock. I need the phone to open UNLOCKED when using GPS and connected to Bluetooth headphones on my motorbike. This app absolutely doesn't work with Xiaomi Mi Max",

I've only tried 2 of these apps but this one was so good I didn't need to search any longer. Only just started my quitting journey, and I think with this apps aid I can stay on track and finally kick this terrible habit. Big thanks to the developers for making such a quality app.",

This app is really helping me reduce consumption by letting me know when it's OK to smoke. I find other healthy pleasures (a video game, a walk to a smoothie shop, comfort food, exercise, tea and nap, etc) during the window in which im not to smoke.    Simple to use.",

If your sleep cycles are the same everyday you're ok. Each time you don't smoke when you suppose to (let's say you're sleeping), the cycle stops and in the middle of the next day, this app says you're done for the day. Then you say \"ship, i just woke up\" and then you keep smoking like crazy. So this app was not helpful for me.",

        "comment": "Works great to help cut back on smoking and set goals. There is one minor flaw in the timing, if u frequently stay awake past midnight, the counter resets. What this means is that if you have a cigarette at 11:55 p.m. then when the time resets at midnight , it allows you to have a cigarette again at 12:01 a.m.  very minor but other than that this app works wonders and has helped me cut back from 25 cigarettes a day down to 13 cigarettes in a little over a month and I don't feel pressured or any withdrawal symptoms.",

And according to me, it will work for me definitely.   I recommend all the wanna be nicotine quitters to give this app a first try.",

It sure has helped me out a lot by making me learn to go without a cigarette in small doses instead of going cold turkey. It will help you, but you have to want to quit and follow the rules...no cheating!",

One tiny change I'd like to see, would be having the numbers in the daily history section be red or green (instead of gray) so I can visually see whether or not I'm having a cigarette outside of the set perimeters.",

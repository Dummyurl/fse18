Update: New beyond pod beta version 4.2.19 is awful and full of bugs... so many bugs... Huge problems as a result, I lost everything. Must backup regularly... Lesson learned",

The final straw for me was an increasing trend of unexplained 'episode failed to download' messages.  Another one that I often came across was the 'Manage Feeds' button failing to work if a podcast drawer is open in 'What To Play'.  Finally, the free version is limited to updating only one podcast at a time (a feature that is offered for free by Podcast Addict).",

For some reason this app thinks it's cute to stop playing the podcast I'm listening to when ever I get out of range of any known Wi-Fi network. Mind you this is for podcasts I've already downloaded, and happens even when I disable Wi-Fi on my phone. I'm fed up with this app arbitrarily closing while I'm listening to podcasts. Time to find a new app that doesn't fail at the ONE JOB a podcast app has, which is playing podcasts!",

There appears to be an incompatibility with Android O. My Pixel was just updated last night and I no longer receive track info over Bluetooth to my 2016 BMW 3 Series. Google play and a number of other apps are working just fine. Hopefully there are still updates planned for Beyondpod. I really want to continue using this app.",

Unfortunately, the small font is difficult to make out in this fashion.  Also, the timer end vibration needs to be longer, so not confused with other notifications.  Thanks, Sam",

The alarm will indeed buzz now when the watch screen is dimmed, the notification is delayed anywhere from 3-4 seconds late to 45 seconds late. Bumped up my review a little as now it has some use for me, would be nice if it was a consistent on time buzz when the timer was up.",

No recent updates and the developer isn't responding to emails. Still good but the widgets have issues in Android a Nougat.",

Love how easy it is to track feeds (left/right/bottle and frequency) diapers (wet, soiled or both),  baths, pumping (left/right and quantity), sleep, growth, teeth, medicines and quantity and more.  Always records the time and has sticky notifications to remind you to feed baby or check diaper. Super helpful with baby brain and answering questions at the pediatricians office.",

Great for breastfeeding to know which side you did last, wonderful for formula to track how much and how often baby is eating.

I always track growth because it's fun and the widgets make life easy. I love this app, used it twice now and it has been well worth the money. In fact, it's the only app I've ever paid for.

We still use the medicine log to keep track of when we give it to our baby, but the alarms just not work and may makes us miss a dosis.  It also misses on traduction to other languages (mainly Spanish), but it is very visual and my wife who doesn't speak English can use it without issues.",

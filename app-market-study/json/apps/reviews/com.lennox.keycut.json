I think there is huge possibility for me if we can use an action within an application that will do a swipe right or left for example.     This button key app is great to start another application or android function.   But how about some in application functions like the swipe right, or even press a specific location on a screen?  I noticed the Next, Previous actions, but these are for music players and will not do a next function in any other applications, like a web browser for example.    How long would that take to get implemented?   Or am I missing something that already allows this?   Great work so far.   Just needs a bit more for me to fully take advantage of this.",

Recognises the clicks and patterns reliably, has a lot of features you can associate to the patterns (though for me it could still be more).  Also works with the 1\u20ac ebay iKey things. Ad-free/pro is only 50cents.",

Haven't ran into any serious problems yet. This app offers so much functionality. I love that it allows you to use shortcuts because then I can use it to trigger my tasker tasks. Great work man, I'll probably pick up the pro key",

It's difficult to get the dev to agree that it's not working...! And I was stupid enough to buy premium key to help the dev.",

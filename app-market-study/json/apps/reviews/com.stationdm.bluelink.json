There is some lag between sending commands and the car responding, though that is likely due to the time it takes for a command to traverse the network to BlueLink, then make its way out through the network to the car. Smartwatch support was a pleasant surprise, and it works brilliantly. I love being able to remote-start my car from my watch!",

I install the app, use it for a few weeks and them I get an error saying \"device invalid\". I them uninstall and reinstall the app and it works fine (for a few days) then I have to do it all over again. This has happened on 2  phones, the Nexus 6P and now the new GOOGLE Pixel 2. Please fix so I can get this back to 5 stars.  When it works:The APP for the parking meter is great downtown. Auto star with temp control works and is great for a hot day at a baseball game and having the car cool before making it to the car after the game.",

I wanted to take it in for repair at the dealer but Hyundai was clueless as to how to fix it and wanted me to pay high diagnostic fees even though the car as a whole and the Blue link system were still under warranty. In addition, Blue Link accidentally cancelled my free trial and I would have had to pay a subscription fee to be able to take it to Hyundai for diagnostic. Wasn't worth it given it may have never worked after all that.",

        "comment": "It's ok, but I'm very annoyed that it puts a 1 mile restriction on the Car Finder part of the app. If you are more than 1 mile away from the car, it won't help you. That is some extra work the software does to NOT tell you where you car is. Don't tell me for privacy reasons, that would be stupid. It's my car, and I want to know where it is no matter how far away I am. What if I want to know where my child has driven my car to?",

        "comment": "It's a rip off.  I was so excited when I bought my car and found out I could start my car using my phone.   Then reality set in.  The cost was over $200 a year to have Blue Link sometimes start my car.  I would be in my house looking at my car and try to remote start and then get an error message.    So if you think about it if you keep your car for over 3 years you are paying over $600 for an app that only works half the time.  You can go and purchase a non factory starter and spend less than $600 and have it work all the time instead of when it wants to work.   Hyundai needs to do better.  This app is a rip off.  I will not be renewing my subscription.",

Cell phones today are tied down and locked to wireless company's and I refuse to accept that therefore I have mine unlocked and rooted. If I didn't I would not be able to run the newest version of Android along with many other features. For Bluelink to lock the app because of this is completely unacceptable!  Being a softer developer for over 20+ years I know this will not cause a single problem. The status of ones cell should not dictate the ability to use your app. This will have a huge impact on my decision to renew my Bluelink service.",

Google maps and waze are better and are free. 5) C/S reps are extremely rude and condescending. They will not help with any problems or issues.

        "comment": "I have to revise my below review (was 4 stars) after an update now their logo/symbol blocks 25% of the screen! There is still no titles available so you have no idea what video you are going to play. I hope they release an app that allows you to stream music from your phone (instead of downloading like most apps) then i wont care if their logo is on the screen, but you still need to see the title of the file and not the length.   This is a great app and allows you to STREAM videos loaded on your phone, let me repeat that, stream them, meaning you dont have to download the video to your watch. Now let me ask you, and the devolopers this VITAL question. HOW COME THERE ARE NO APPS THAT LET YOU STREAM MUSIC TO YOUR WATCH? These developers should add streaming audio playback to this app, or design a 2nd. The only issue i have with this app is that it does not list titles from the video tracks so you have no idea what your playing until it starts. If it listed titles it would get 5 stars easy",

Also you can't get your money back because the full version is an in-app instead of a different app.  Also,  once the app freezes,  it won't play again until you restart your watch.",

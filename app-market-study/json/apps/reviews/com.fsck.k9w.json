Since upgrading to the latest version of wristmail for wear, where the name changed, I have not been able to forward attachments on my Sony Xperia Z1 compact even after the attachment has been downloaded. When I tap forward, the attachment is not included and has to be manually attached. Can anyone help me here. Thanks.",

I also can't compose emails, I can only reply. If this app gets more polished, you can use multiple accounts on the wear app, and if you can compose a new email, then I would change my rating to a 5.",

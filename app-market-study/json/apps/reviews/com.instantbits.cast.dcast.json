So ppl on here supposedly enjoy voicing their displeasure by giving out bad ratings just for the heck of it eh? Is the word \"love\"the type of word complacent individuals FEEL like using to describe a proper rating? this platform is perfect to complain about others complaining lol. mentally unstable mentalities who brag of others complaining should lower their expectations of others voicing their displeasure of what an app should be rated, if you don't like others low ratings?

It goes from .1 mpg to 5000 plus mpg.   Never a credible number.  And these guys want to sell us a self-driving car someday?",

And as luck would have it, this is always worse in the winters. After installing, and reinstalling it various different times, as well as completely deleting the vehicles and re-installing them it is still no more reliable than it ever was. After resetting the modem in the vehicle by removing and reinstalling the fuse, the performance is better for about 3 months. Then back to all the old problems. I've had two different Fusion plug-in hybrids over a four-year period. Time to move on to something that works. The average rating of this app has been between two and three points from since its first launch. No progress in reliability, despite many complaints from users.",

Now it has stopped working after 6 months. I spent several hours over the weekend trying to get it to work again with no luck. I called the sync support line today and they tell me that I need the firmware of my modem upgraded and the app will then work again.  Hey Ford, you should let us know when your stuff is not going to work. So easy for you to contact us to let us know what we need to do to get this working again. Or just give us a head's up that something is going to stop working.   I would like to roll back my version of the app to work with my old firmware, but Ford makes you go to a dealer to  upgrade the firmware...Ford has no chance of competing with Tesla when it comes to technology.",

Now when my smug Apple Watch friends ask if my 360 can tell me if I've been sitting too long, I can proudly say yes. Thanks to the developer for the great work, I've gladly purchased the premium version.",

If the 360 doesn't offer a movement sensor, an easy fix would be to just reset the timer manually when the user acknowledges the notification on their watch.  I hope this can be improved because I really need this app as I am a developer as well and sit way to much.",

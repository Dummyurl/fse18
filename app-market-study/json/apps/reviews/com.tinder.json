I sardonically requested payment from a user who was berating me for sex. Once again, I understand the request for payment is against terms and conditions. My complaints are as follows: 1. Men constantly harass women for sex utilizing this application, causing discomfort and violating the terms and conditions; 2. When I reached out to Tinder for answers, there was no correspondence. I've been attempting to reach someone for days to no avail.",

So what tinder is doing is hijacking random pics of girls, creating fake profiles with fake names to populate their swipes so you keep thinking there are real people. Fact is less than 10% are real profiles. Good luck",

You will experiences issues like being unable to log in (Tinder will usually blame your internet connection even if it's blatantly not, rather than offer real solutions).  Its inconvient at the best of times, you will at some point loose all your matches or messages or something. Tinder catch phrase is \"something went wrong\". Unfortunately there's not a better alternative to Tinder, perhaps this lack of competition is why Tinder can afford to be so terrible.",

After receiving the notifying email, I made a complaint because I believe this was an error and was falsely reported/banned. I am emailed back and was asked for a screenshot of the issue. How was I supposed to send screencaps? I explained yet again and asked to at least be given a reason as to why I had had my account deleted. And then received an email being told that my account was deleted. No, really? \ud83d\ude12 Very unhelpful.",

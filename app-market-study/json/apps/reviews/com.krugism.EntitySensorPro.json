The only REAL para app on google play. Extremely boring app if no spirits are around. (Which is usually). Even the graphics are real boring, with a third of your screen blacked out. Tons of features, upgrades are great and inexpensive. Only .99 for the YES/NO commo feature. The dev keeps coming up with new inventions, too. Very advanced.",

When I hit the buy button, it takes me to the plays store and gives me the option to uninstall or to open... How does this get resolved? I already purchased the app. I would like to be able to use it.",

So higher EMF on the left will be for Yes, on the right for No. When you tilt your phone, that changes the EMF that's read using the sensor, and it will cause the Yes/No to display.

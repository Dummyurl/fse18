One thing that the app can really benefit from - adding a % on the front page, to calculate/add/subtract the percentage, as in regular calculators. Another 'nice to have' feature would be to have a memory add/view/clear buttons (on the next page, if necessary).",

Every time I hit the = button nothing happened, but its because the hidden button was blocking it. I changed the size of the hidden button and now we're good to go. No hard feelings? ;-)",

        "comment": "This calculator has a strange user experience. For example, after pressing = the next digit will *append* to the previous result rather than clearing and starting a new input. Thus the button sequence 5 * 35 = 4 * 17 = does not result in 175 then 68. Instead it results in 175 then 29818 (that is, 175 then 1754 * 17 = 29818.)  So if you are used to other calculators, you need to learn to use clear after each = result with this calculator when you want to start a new calculation. This behavior may be OK once you get used to it, but again it is different from just about any calculator I've ever used. This is why I only rated this a 3 - I think it degrades from usability.  I discovered that a long press on the 'C' (clear) button will clear the entire display, and a quick click on 'C' will only remove one digit. It's also a little strange (to me) that pressing 'C' once will also remove a digit from a *result*, so be careful - you can alter a result without realizing it.  Unlike other calculators for Android Wear, 1/3*3 results in 1, not 0.999999.  I would prefer to see multiplication represented with the standard 'X' button label, not '*'.",

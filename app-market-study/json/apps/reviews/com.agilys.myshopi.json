It was a great app. I loved the function that allows adding/hiding category and adding new item with picture. Now, you have to download another app for \u201cInternational Region\u201d. The original app is only available for \u201cBelgium Region\u201d. It does not support English and you still have to reset everything. I'm so regretted that I updated to the latest version. If I have to reset everything, why do I have to stick with this app?",

After spending two days reinstalling pictures for all my custom entries, it reset itself back to Belgian language again. I wish I could just use previous version, or I would love a paid version that I can depend on.  2017 June 14. Update not in English! I uninstalled, and reinstalled. Now in English again. Can import previous backup from SD card, if you have a backup. 2016 July 26 Latest update changes layout - too much white space for phone use.      2016 April 07.

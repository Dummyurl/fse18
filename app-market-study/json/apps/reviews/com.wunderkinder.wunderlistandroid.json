If you have the memory span of a gnat (like me) you can set reminders. Terrific for planning and for backup to personal calendar. I love the option to check off completed tasks (and they're not deleted so if the person you're sharing with checks it off before it's done, you can go back to review).  Even free, its a 9 on the Divorced Mom of Teenagers scale!",

It loads quickly, syncs within a few seconds, and remembers your completed tasks. But it only shows them if reqested and you can permanently delete if you wish. Nice basic selection of backgrounds. Very easy and intuitive to use.   Exactly what I have been searching for",

The only complaint I have to make is about the widget: it doesn't seem to register the touch when I want to change the list from my Inbox to my Work todos. It is quite annoying especially because the widget can give you a nice, compact view of your tasks but since it doesn't update it's pointless. Hope you can fix it quickly, that would definitely convince me to give you the 5th star.",

Lol it's very easy to use and convenient. Kinda slow sending new additions to the list though. If I add something sometimes he doesn't get it until after he leaves the store. They need to work on that. But other than that it's a great app. Thanks",

Excellent app, love how easy it is to edit tasks. I'm so pleased how I'm able to set due dates and it will show me tasks due regardless of what list they're on if I go to Today.

However there are a lot of great to do list apps and you can not afford to have even one let down feature.  For Wunderlist the one thing that lets it down for us is the lack of flexibility of the widgets.  Seriously why does it need to take up the whole width of the phone screen?  Let us make it smaller and change transparency and colours and font size.  I need my tasks on my main work screen but I only have space for a 2x2 or even 2x1 widget.",

I have it synced to my calendar and also use the reminders feature so I never forget anything, especially important appointments, and can see at a glance if I'm free at any given time. Some lists I never check off, such as family medication lists and the usual packing list, so I have those wherever I go. I also use it to have a shopping list synced between all devices (and shared with my husband's account) so I can add things whenever I think of them. I highly recommend this to anyone and am so grateful someone recommend it to me.",

Wunderlist helps me pull all those together and keep track of my thoughts in various categories. It helps me set milestones within a particular task which helps shorten the entire list,  making it more manageable.  I can also share it with my colleagues and collaborators,  so truly,  I have nothing more to ask of it. Perfect app for me!",

If task have sub task, then main task can be complete if all sub task are completed   c. Possibility of adding due date to sub task and Due date of main task can be due date of last sub task.   d. All sub task will get sorted on due date.   e. Recurring task should have three option e1) Create new task irrespective of present task status. e2) New task will be created after closing this task as per frequency e3) New task will be created but due date will be date of closer of present task + frequency  f) In shared list all task are visible to all, But if any tasked created in shared list should have two attribute one - Who can see the task & to whom it is assigned.  g) In shared list any one can complete task, on other hand only task owner should allowed to complete the task.",

So instead of saying \"I'm going to the grocery store, what do you want?\" you can say \"I might go to Target Thursday after work. If you want anything, add it to that list.\" It makes shopping a ton easier especially when you can look back at what was previously on the list. I also use it to keep track of tasks both short and long term. And checking it off the list is always very satisfying. I have been using it for years and my only complaint is the automatic reminders when you mention a day. But it's easily removed. All in all very pleased.",

I have many permanent lists - one for each vehicle, telling when my next oil change is, etc.  Shared grocery list with my Sweetheart, a Home Depot list, one for each of my work projects, shared with my boss, or whoever...the list goes on, you get the idea.  I'm going through the \"Today\" list right now... The great thing is, as you go through and check off the tasks, they disappear from the list, so for example, when I'm at the grocery store and the list is blank - I know I'm done.  I've gotten family and friends all over the world started on this app and I've gotten great feedback from them as well.   Cheers!",

It's super simple, user friendly, and very useful. Highly recommended!",

This app gives you the ability to have as many lists as you like, and you can name them whatever you like. The ease of use is the most important thing I was looking for, and this list has it.

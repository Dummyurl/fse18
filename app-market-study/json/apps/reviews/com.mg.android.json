Have been a Premium customer for about 7 years on Apple and Android and was lured away from the incrrasingly outdated (at the time), Met Office app. Now, I'm beginning to find the same things annoying me with Weatherpro that made me move from the Met office. I have a much faster phone these days, yet increasingly finding the WP Map animations slow & clunky. Also slow to update. So you are told about the weather you have already had and no projection as to how it might pad out. You can't help but wonder if this app is being neglected now Meteogroup have the BBC taking up their time?",

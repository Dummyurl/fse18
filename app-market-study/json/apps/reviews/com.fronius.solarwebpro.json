Judders and freezes while scrolling. * When reopened, displays bad data while it refreshes. * Design is inconsistent at best. Ignores most Android recommendations and best practises * Icons don't make sense. No title or explanation when tapped on.  This is just what I have noticed after a day of use.  To ask $5 for this is pretty galling after forking out for the inverter AND the monitoring equipment, let alone when it is such an unprofessional app. If you have a fronius, you are probably stuck with this junk, if you haven't already, well, you know what you're in for.",

But you let someone design the worst interface I've seen I can barely read the numbers on my phone.... it looks good but its useless.   Power consumption figures etc is all I need to see and lets face that is all the people who paid you $1000's for your inverter system want to see.  Rather than have large numbers telling me this I've got miniature curved numbers on a background of white and washed out grey numbers.   What idiot thought this was  a good idea. So if you must keep this crap interface,  just produce an alternative Big number version for your clients who actually want to use it and for the \"Grid feed in\" mark the numbers in red RED if we are drawing from it.  For such an innovative company you need to get some decent web / app designers because currently they are rubbish ! The fact you have to to back to solar web old to access most data makes it so obvious!!",

        "comment": "Handy, but room for improvement. The Android app doesn't show values on the main animation - you have to zoom in on each component to read a value (see the screenshots above). The webpage Solar.web animation shows PV, consumption and grid feed kW values all at the same time - much easier to understand at a glance. Further, a screen capture only shows stationary dots - no direction info. Two-colour dots or arrows, along with kW values on each arm of the schematic, would be much more helpful than just the blue dots.  In fact a little more colour throughout, especially on the charts, would make things easier to take in at a glance.  Also, setup menus really need more in-app (and more complete on-line) instructions. Another annoyance for me - Total Income on this app on my Samsung Note 2 is stuck on $1, yet the Webpage and iOS version shows a more likely value - while I can adjust this on other versions, I can't seem to change it on this Android version. Considering this is the paid-for version, it should be much better than it is.",

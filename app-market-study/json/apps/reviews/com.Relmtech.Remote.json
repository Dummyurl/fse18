It's also pretty good with Spotify since non premium membership using skip on the Spotify app to control the Spotify on my PC is limited.   However on my Huawei Honor 6. I have to move the mouse pointer slow otherwise the mouse pointer doesn't register my swipes.",

        "comment": "I've always wanted a TV remote for my PC with flashing animated ads that loses connection if more than thirty seconds passes. Lovely minimalist app with fifty menus and wonderfully designed interfaces that make controlling my computer like raking nails down a chalkboard. I'm concerned that your marketspace might be edged out by the fifty foot USB cable, or one of the hundreds of identical apps on the app store. You should make a remote app for every device in my house! Now all I have to do is press 5 small targets on screen, and pray to cthulu, and I can control my toaster. Or is the toaster roaster controller going to be in the paid version of your next app?",

        "comment": "This app works, but when I want to scroll, it pinch zooms, even when I've turned it off.   Edit: I found a scroll wheel function, but using the 2 finger scroll method would be easier if it didn't think I was pinching to zoom in or out (bare in mind that I turned off the pinch to zoom option in the mouse settings).  A suggestion I would make is a forward or back button for web browsing. Having to use my mouse to click back can become repetitive, especially when you're sitting quite far from the screen; it is a pretty small icon.",

While using the power options, I somehow managed to hit the sleep button multiple times, still not sure what happened. It ended up putting my PC into an endless loop. This wouldn't have been a huge deal if windows hadn't made it so you can't boot into safe mode without shutting your computer down in a special way or windows failing 4 times in a row. My biggest concern is that they know this is a problem because there's a guide on their website as to what your supposed to do to fix it, but they haven't made it so you can't hit the button multiple times in a row. I'm really glad they had the guide otherwise it probably would've taken me 4 times longer to fix it, but it's not that hard to at the very least add a delay to the button or something.",

Yardage updates are slow to stabilize.  When starting on any hole other than #1 the app doesn't continue smoothly to #1 after #18. The flyover feature is marginally useful. Club recommendations are usually off by 2 to 3 clubs. Calculating wind effects and elevation differences would improve this feature.",

Tracking functionality on the smart watch is missing a key feature of tracking the direction of your ball (right, left, center), so it's not nearly as useful as it could be. If the course map isn't accurate, you're basically hosed for any kind of tracking and distances to the pin.",

I e-mailed back with my account information, and never heard another thing.    I complained to my credit card company, who refunded the charge (at their own cost).

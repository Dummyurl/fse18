It does not recognize my Roku Stick nor my TCL Roku TV (but they do connect manually) and the one thing lacking from ALL of the Roku apps except the official; does not control the volume or wake a Roku TV from Eco Mode. So I find myself switching back and forth between the two (this has better layout than the official app). Hopefully these can be addressed in the future.",

I tried others (including the app from Roku itself) and this one was far superior. However, it needs better support-- a help tab under the menu that tells how to pair and lists a website or email address. And FAQs/support email on the website.  Also: minor potential bug in the paid version. Another reviewer, Toya, reported having to manually input the IP address. The TinyByte reply was that it was a network fluke. Well... I had the exact same thing happen, and the exact same setup. The trial worked right out of the box... I hit \"scan\", it found my Roku, and it worked right  away. But the paid one, I tapped \"scan\", and nothing happened. Restarted the app, same thing. Eventually, I manually entered the IP address and then it worked fine. But not everyone will think to do that, or know where to look. (Here's where you need in-app FAQs.)  Like Toya, I have my Roku connected via ethernet... so maybe that's part of the issue? I don't have it connected to my home wireless. Anyway-- guys, this is starting to look like a bug and not a network glitch.",

        "comment": "So I lost my Roku remote. Seriously, no idea where I put it. (I figure as soon as I have a workable solution, I'll find it. Murphy's Law and all that.)  I priced out replacing the remote and the cheapest I can find is $20 or 30.... and there's always the possibility that I'll lose that one, too. You know what I never lose, though? My tablet.  The Official Roku app requires that your Roku be on the same wireless network as your phone/tablet, but my Roku is wired because I wanted the faster connection. In that case, the Official Roku app simply doesn't work for you... Added to that, in order to set up the wireless, I'd need the remote (or a working substitute), which I don't have.   This app had good reviews, so I did the two-day free trial. I'm not even through the end of that yet, but I already know I'm willing to pay for the full version. It discovered my Roku with no setup. It works even though my Roku is wired. It has all the functionality of my original remote and I'm exponentially less likely to lose it.   Totally awesome. Thank you!!",

It's a really, really, good remote. The widgets are a great addition as well! When I requested something to the developer he was very quick to respond. Getting a response at all is great, he was tip top in helping me.",

My favorite function is the keyboard/search; works very well.  I also like the swipe option for the remote. I would like to see added support for \"Play on Roku\" (a new function of the official app) to stream mp3s and photos from phone through roku device.  Very cool feature that I would like to see added to this app.  Keep it up!",

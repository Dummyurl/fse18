Seems like this would be the best way to show step information instead of trying to calculate it yourself. (2) The settings say the Heart Rate Sensor is not detected. I have an LG G Watch R and this is one of the main reasons I purchased the watch face.",

Missed call and missed massages This is why people buy smart watches ..... Unless its fixed,  i think i wasted my money,  I doubt my watch is getting annoyed or interested whilst charging... Can you please fix it and than you will have created  a truly 5 star face very  innovative and clean  design  A ) Sensor on and off at user request  B)  Notify user of missing messages and emails  Otherwise may as well use a normal watch........  i will be very happy to give it a five star but not as it is..............

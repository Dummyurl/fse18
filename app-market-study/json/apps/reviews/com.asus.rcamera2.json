Now after the update some of the features like ZenWatch manager, zenwatch remote & facedesign cannot be install to the watch. Cannot copy google account to watch, therefore play store on watch doesn't work. Eventhought google play music doesn't exit anymore on the watch. New gorgeous watch because an update felt like less features..... Pls fix this matter asap.  If not the watch not worthy for me any more. Fed up with this problem.",

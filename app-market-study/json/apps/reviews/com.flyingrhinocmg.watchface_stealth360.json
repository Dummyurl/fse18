However when I switched to a new phone and everything from the watch to the app and android wear updated & upon trying to pair no matter how many times I reinstall and repair and resync everything the watch face doesn't appear in android wear :( . This is on the Moto 360 2 but I think the issue is with either Android Wear or this watch face app.",

I've bought a lot of faces and I normally never get more than 30 hours on my Huawei watch and usually less than 30 but with this face I get over 40 hours and that's with using always on and max brightness. It's a great indoors face as well since it's dark.",

I guess if you wanted your watchface stock, it would be fine, but in trying to customize the colors on mine, absolutely nothing I did was appearing on my watch. No matter how I went about applying the fixes, no update. Then to make matters worse, I closed the app in hopes that this would clear it up, but when I opened it again I was unable to load the preset that I had saved. Waste of an hour, but at least it wasn't a waste of my money as well.",

Alerts on the wear device when your phone is disconnected (because you left it on a table somewhere) and also on wear when your phone battery is low.  Great features in a simple to use app that's \"always on' - no hassle.",

Wear Aware, you could specify which sound you wanted to use and didn't use the alarm system. Also, maybe a BUNCH of vibration... Like 3-4 buzzes minimum... The G Watch has fairly light vibration (as do most AW from what I've heard) and it wouldn't be hard to miss this. Phone Status doesn't work on my G Watch.. Feature coming soon. All together a great app though!",

I only really see a benefit in the find my phone feature since android wear does most everything else, but hey, it works and it does exactly what it says. So many watch apps on google play are being bashed by people who have something not synced correctly. Resync your apps if you have issues. Worse case, reset your wear and pair your device again.",

I really _don't_ like the Phone Battery Low alert, because it doesn't go away when the phone has been charged. So nearly every morning I have to swipe away a Battery Low alert from the night before - boring. If there were options in the app for which alerts I wanted to see, I'd like it a lot better (or if it would self-dismiss the battery alert when the phone reported charging, that would be excellent). I've never needed the Find My Phone function that's the only other thing it can do, so can't comment.",

I assume this is where one goes to get to the Start/Stop ringing screens to locate the phone.  I should be able to call this up from the watch alone.  I hope the developer will contact me with instructions so I will be able to use these features.  I will up my rating when I am able to use the application features as described.  [UPDATE] Useful reply from developer explained how to launch.  Phone status feature not implemented but phone locator is.  I'm upping my review 1-star.

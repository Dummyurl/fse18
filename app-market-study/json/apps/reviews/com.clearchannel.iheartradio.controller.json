I could go to my songs and play them like normal but no sound would come out (yes my volume was on and my speakers work) I had uninstalled and reinstalled several times thinking that it would work but it didn't. I have not see anyone else talk about this and I would like to bring it to iheart's attention. Hopefully they can fix it",

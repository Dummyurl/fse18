I don't believe that it's the fault of MobileDay, Outlook doesn't work with any other app that I know of.  Sometimes I really hate Microsoft, but I've got no choice for now.    So, if you use pretty much any calendar app other than Outlook, and it works with other apps MobileDay is highly recommended.    If you use Outlook as your calendar MobileDay will work as long as you also connect the standard Android calendar to your Exchange server.  I did this for some time, but Microsoft Outlook 365 no longer works with the Android mail or calendar so this is no longer an option, at least for me.",

My calls are sensitive, and this is concerning. If information was to be disclosed, my employer would hold me responsible for using an unapproved service to route my calls over. Needs an option to dial directly.   Also, quality is much worse than dialing the bridge directly.",

However a recent update or some other change has now prevented mobile day from displaying any of my calendar information or any of my conference calls.  It is useless to me now.

Greedy company that was charging subscription for a simple app, now trying to make more by routing calls through a strange phone number. No way to opt out. I can't use it - in this day and age my corporate security team would fire and even sue if one of this company's employees breached security and listened in to a call or tracked data about it. Folks my company phone use is PRIVATE INFORMATION!",

There was NO warning or explanation for this.  I am paying for this app to dial the toll-free numbers as they were put into the app - , not charge calls to South Dakota.  Seems very sketchy now - no longer performing as sold to me.  The SD number has been removed - now showing it as the 888.  I had complaints on calls from other call-ins over the quality the first couple days - have not had any issues noted since then,.",

Dialing a long distance number to get Mobile Day to join my conference bridge instead of dialing the toll free number direct isn't acceptable.    Mobile Day has been a great app for a long time, but this change essentially makes the app pointless.   I can't justify the long distance calling when I have an 800 number available for my conferencing, especially from my mobile phone.",

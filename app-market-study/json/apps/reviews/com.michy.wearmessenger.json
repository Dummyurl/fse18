I was having trouble getting the message to send as the send icon was on the edge of the screen where my watch face is not as responsive. The developer was quick to respond and let me know I could send  simply holding the message window, which works perfectly. I have the Moto 360  2nd Gen and am using the  FlickKey keyboard.",

Also, there is no quick shortcut to view the entire conversation after getting a notification. Adding those features would make this the perfect messenger app! Could these be added? Thanks!",

Other than that, works great. No crashes, bugs or glitches so far. Reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it doesn't let you personalize quick replies for certain contacts.  Again not a huge deal but something that would definitely be really usefull. Would say this app and coffee when it comes back will definitely be the 2 to beat",

It's like the second takes over. Can u if this? Didn't have this issue with textra. Really becoming an issue. Only see second of 2 texts from person if both sent back to back.

Pros: -Lots of keyboard options, gives you the capability to send actual messages off your watch without dictation or canned responses. -Quickly pushes messages to your watch, I have had Wear Messaging apps in the past that took several minutes to refresh. -Opens to a dialer so you can also make calls or send messages to numbers not in your phonebook. -Many customizations for notifications -Enforce mode allows it to work with unsupported SMS clients  Cons: -Lack of support from Flickkey, as mentioned above -No MMS support- which means no group messaging either -QWERTY keyboards are larger than watch screen, requiring you to scroll back and forth, made up for by smaller available keyboards.  Used on Huawei Watch  Will update here if either developer responds.",

I suppose if you I really took a few weeks to drill through a ton of messages it could work for me, but the idea of an app is to make life easier not give you something to work on. I give it 2 starts for a valient effort, as I suspect the issue has more to do with the relatively new android wear platform os. This may work for someone with small fingers, and a chunk of time to train. Asked for a refund and havent heard back.",

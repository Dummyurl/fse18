I still get through a whole day but instead of the 26-32 hours I get on most faces I get about 18-20 on this face.  I wish it had some more customisation options like changing the hand styles, font and smooth seconds.  Also some custom tick marker settings would spice it up and allowing the removing of the tick markers and using numbers or some other design.  Overall a solid face that's worth the $1.40",

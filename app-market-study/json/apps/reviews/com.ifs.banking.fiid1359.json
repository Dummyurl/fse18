Transfers are instant and so easy! I don't know what took so long I literally waited years for this function but they finally added a memo option to the transfer section so that you can notate what you're transferring money for an absolute necessity for me, now I don't have to use my phone to log on to the actual website to do that and I can leave a memo every time to help me keep track of exactly what I pulled money For. Thanks Wright-Patt.",

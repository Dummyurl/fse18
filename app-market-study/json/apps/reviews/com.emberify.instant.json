One issue though, when wanting to not automatically track location, unchecking that box isn't being saved. Every time I check back the box is checked again. I'm not seeing a \"save\" button so I assume that it's supposed to save changes automatically. Until that's resolved, 3 stars is the best I can recommend.",

I really don't know where to begin .. one thing that I noticed that most of us will not notice is that the data itself that it tracks is not accurate .. since I had to be detailed I was tracking the time I spent on each app and I realized that it was much less than what I expected.. but couldn't tell for sure ..until I came across Skype where it said that I spent 5 mins on one day .. I went back to Skype and checked the duration of my call on that day .. and it was much of a differnce.. that is only one issue .. but really an important one cause all the others such as graphs and how easy it is to access data is not really important if the data itself is not right!!!!",

On the weekly stats for places, it says \"Add places to view weekly stats\" but I have work and home set up in my places. It provides the data when you click on individual days, but won't provide the summary for the week. There are similar other short comings in a promising app.",

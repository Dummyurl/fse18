        "comment": "This is the most important app you can get for Android Wear 2. Hands down. Why? Too many reasons. First off the music controls are MONUMENTALLY better then the default. You can actually HIT THE BUTTONS. I don't think I need to tell anyone using Android Wear 2 that the default screen controller is extremely hard to hit, especially while driving. This brings me to my next point, physical button support. Why have so few apps integrated this?? It's true there's a lot of watches that only have the one button, which isn't really rebindable since it's needed for critical wear navigation. But what about those of us who saw the value of a second bindable physical button and went out of our way to buy one that did? We were left with a mediocre means of customization, one app, single click. Music center answers that problem too, not only does it finally allow us to CONTEXTUALLY bind single, double and even LONG press as a physical button for music controls, a must while driving. It also allows us to bind Tasker or other apps as well. All while within the app on the watch. Because the best part is, once we leave the app, it goes back to our original default, just like you'd imagine. This has completely remade my Android Wear experience and I may have to donate money to this dev because he is my hero. \ud83d\ude00  Sorry, I'm just genuinely excited how much this fixes for me.",

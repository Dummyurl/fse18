        "comment": "Post your question, and a doctor will post an answer. It's fast for a question-answer app. Response times to my questions seem to range from 10 minutes to 10 hours. The site's doctors also have a premium service where you can see a real, live doctor on screen via a virtual appointment, and get a diagnosis and maybe a prescription (but not drugs like narcotics or anxiety drugs). The app is free for posting general medical questions. The one-on-one consultations have a fee, and you can select between primary care or specialists.",

Also helps to guide when something more severe happens. They can even send prescriptions to my pharmacy. It saves me time, reduces stress and makes my life easier!",

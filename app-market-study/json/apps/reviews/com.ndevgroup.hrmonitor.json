I like the alarm option but needs to be able to be more customisable as in several types of alarm at once and different/ custom sounds.  At this moment language can be either English or Russian.  Let me know if you'd like free help translating the app to Spanish. Keep it up.",

Thus app appears to work it connects and records but need it to tell strap to record a sessoo n and then download it.  Want to download so might have to splurge for download capabilities.  So far it's ok.  Will add more as needed",

I had to press the back button 712 times to set my birth date, a truly appalling date picker, the worst I've ever seen, ever, anywhere, and I've been writing software since 1976. Unless you want to send me a birthday card why not just ask for my age?  2. I paid for the version that allows export of data and found that it still shows adverts, apparently there's another charge to remove the adverts.  3. You can uninstall it but you can't get a refund because \"As your item was available for immediate delivery you agreed to waive your statutory withdrawal period. See the Google Play Refund Policy and the Terms of Service.\" That's a new one on me.  I'll review this later when I've tried it, I hope I can give it some stars.",

A couple features which would be ideal is to have a screen dedicated heart rate with a large font and possibly an option for different sound alerts and maybe vibration. I would give it 4 stars but after awhile it loses connection to my HR belt and I have to manually connect it again.",

        "comment": "This is an excellent app for those looking to log heart rate vs GPS & altitude while hiking in the mountains. Files are saved as CSV type and can easily be exported to Excel for graphing purposes. I love this app, its one of the few that will work with a GARMIN HR watch..and a SAMSUNG S4 (watch must be connected via ANT+).. Note: the app may not work on all phones ( ie: my LG G5). Note2: The phone must be connected to the internet if you plan on mapping (using the GPS function in the app),..not always easy if you're in the mountains Google ANT+ and cell phones prior to buying a cell phone if you plan on matching a heart rate device such as my Garmin watch. The app is very easy to connect to the watch and very easy to use.",

        "comment": "I got this because it continuously measures and displays the heart rate from the watch, as a standalone. Furthermore, display is with big red, easily seen digits. When connected to the phone it can record and show the HR in diagrams. Improvement points: I tried starting this with the watch on the table, which apparently also has a heartbeat, and it fluctuates (!). Sometimes start up on me, not the table, can take minutes to register. Finally, HR references, e g max pulse, in the diagram are non changeable.",

Last update changed something bc it just doesn't connect at all with the hrm, it even produces malfunction. I reset the device and no change. Issue comes from app. Hope y'all fix it bc it was a decent app! I'm sadly moving on.",

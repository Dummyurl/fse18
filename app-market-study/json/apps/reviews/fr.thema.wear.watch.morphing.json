If you have the battery the battery icon set to on in Ambient mode and you get a notification, the two elements will clash making it hard to read. It's a good thing one or the other can be turned off to avoid this problem. I wish there were some sort of feature that could hide the battery while a notification is up, but this isn't a deal breaker for me. While this Morphing theme doesn't have the awesomeness and animations of the Tron-styled Vector theme, it's simple and gets the job done while still being nice to look at.",

I wanted a watch face that can report my phone and watch battery life, weather, and Google fit steps.  I tried a couple facer faces that seemed to slow down the watch and burn through battery.  This face seems to be battery friendly, displays clearly all of the data I want while the watch performance is not sluggish at all.  Overall my favorite watch face.",

I can't count how many times my phone in in my pocket or bag while biking  or another room and I want to know if it needs charging.   Finally I can check my battery while riding my bike to see if I have enough to battery to stream music for the rest of my trip or if I need to stop streaming.  *small bug, sometimes it shows 0% battery and I have to close then re-open it to see actual percentage.",

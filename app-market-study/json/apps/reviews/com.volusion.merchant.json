When it finally present sales figures the data is inaccurate for two reasons. 1) The sales totals on the app don't always match the totals on the store back end.  2) (Most frustrating for me) The daily reporting is a 24 report.   There is no way to report your sales tally for the day.

I don't understand why reporting is shown as a rolling 24 hours. Retail businesses need to see reporting from 12:00am to 11:59pm. NOT a rolling 24 hours. I want to see day over day results. Rolling 24h reporting makes no sense, it's useless to my business. It's really unfortunate that Volusion will not take comments by many users and make some changes.",

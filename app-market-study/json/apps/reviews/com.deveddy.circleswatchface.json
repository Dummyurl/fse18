It Is beautiful, the only thing that would make it better is if you could change the color but the blue is still awesome. It's weird that the Moto 360 in the picture slideshow doesn't have a \" flat tire\" bar for the sensor.",

Luckily the effect is gone after a few minutes but I think eventually it may stay. Would be nice if in ambient mode the circles are thinner and less bright to avoid this.",

        "comment": "Like the concept, but because of the circles, it over emphasised the black bar on my moto 360 since the outer seconds & minutes rings are completely masked by it. First time I've been overly aware of the watch's flat tyre is with this face. Also the centre digits seemed not quite exactly horizontally lined up level. An illusion, or perhaps my moto 360 module isn't exactly level in its housing. Again, only noticeable with this face.",

Google finally made a face with date, but \"Streetart\" doesn't look nearly as clean as this and is harder to read.  Ambient support is much appreciated!  I'd love to see a few more things like am/pm label next to time, yet more date display options, an in-watch option menu, and (from Streetart) auto adjusting time/date display that moves up and down when cards come in.  Google, hire this vampire!",

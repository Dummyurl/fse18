Unfortunately the app is extremely buggy at this point and it is not ready for daily use .  I use Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1 and every time I click on Start Workout, it takes on average 3-4 minutes to load up the video. Then you hear the audio for 2-3 seconds and the app crashes. It takes about 2 minutes to restart the video and it crashes again and again and again. Out of about 15 attempts, the app managed to play the workout video 3 times.   This app allows you to play your own music but the moment you start FitWell it takes over your music feed. Also their own workout music stops playing after about 5 minutes of starting a workout, so you are stuck finishing it in silence. There are also few smaller bugs as well. Like I said, I really love this app but I am going to cancel my 1-month trial period for now and give this app another try in a year or two.",

And then when I'd be at the gym if I tried to open the work out it would start to download it again. I don't want to use my data up on some stupid video of a person doing it. I just need a quick explanation of the exercise and then a rep counter / timer. Honestly I wouldn't buy this app if I was anybody that is serious about exercising. I want my money back",

However, FitWell changed my life: I work as a freelancer and I pretty much sit whole day with my computer or travel. Therefore, I dont have too much time to do exercise. But with this app you can work out anywhere and you dont need to have a gym or any gym equipment. Food loggings are amazing. Stepcounter is great and yet the REMINDERS are absolutely the BEST I ve seen so far. Big thank you for this life saving app! :)",

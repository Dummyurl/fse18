        "comment": "I have the newest face, downloaded a Monday(afternoon). I have already noticed a big increase in battery consumption(Running Moto 360). I ran a test for you based off of your face VS the stock military dial Moto face.  -Ran the stock Moto military dial face from 0620 to 2200. I was at 33% battery life at 1000(Ambient mode off) -Ran your watch face from 0620 and by 0957 I was at 33%(Ambient mode off)  Now something I have noticed with your watch face installed is that my screen does not shut off like it should and seems to run all the time. I do not use ambient mode, so if this face is meant to run in that mode, then this review may mean nothing to you.   If ambient mode is not a factor then there is something going on when it comes to the screen being on. It does not turn off in the same manor when I am running the stock moto military dial. Every time I glance at the watch after an alert has come through the screen stays on until I hit the button on the side of the watch. With the stock face I cannot glance at my watch and I really have to make an effort to look at the watch to get the screen to come on even after an alert has come through. This saves on battery life big time",

However, not sure where it is getting its temperature readings as they are listed about 10% cooler than the actual temperature.  10/19/2014 I don't know what you did but you amazingly improved the battery life and now I can move away from the stock MOTO watch faces.   I hope you can do more but you made a huge difference in the screen time on the wear.  Great job.",

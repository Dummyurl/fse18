I can't press next if I don't choose Google Voice, but I'm outside US/Canada.  Also, when I press next after selecting \"use google voice\" the app will crash and I have to redo the tutorial again (still same error). Can't even enter the main app. The voice command \"send whatsapp ...\" is somehow working, but I keep randomly getting the sample popup on setup/tutorial that I have to swipe. If the issue is fixed, it will be an easy 5/5",

I can't speak much for any features but Tasker integration, and it works wonderfully with WhatsApp.  However, in Android oreo, this app is obliterating my battery. It accounts for over 30% of my total usage, even though it literally runs through Tasker only once a day in the morning to send 2 messages. I'm not sure what's going, and I hope this gets fixed soon so I can change my review.",

Inconsistent design. The insistence on aligning app messages with phone contacts is unintuitive and time consuming. Smart repliers glitchy, trying to make one based on WiFi gives me \"WiFi error: Can't find wifi networks\" so they're rather useless. Tapping the help button brings up a Dropbox file not found page.  Pros: usually gets the job done, and with more options than the others out there. Has a lot of potential.",

I reply without turning things on and its just a really great program. It does foul up with \"to continue google needs to use your contacts\" message here and there, ive authorized it so many times but still the same. Five stars for concept, but 4 stars for this issue I hope I or someone could figure out a fix, forums haven't found me anything. This developer is amazing though.",

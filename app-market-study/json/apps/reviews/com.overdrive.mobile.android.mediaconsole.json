Overdrive makes it really easy to browse and check out library books even if you're busy or on the go. Highly recommend. If you have any trouble syncing books across devices make sure you have logged in the same way on both devices (overdrive account vs library card info)",

The history only shows 20 books and that list doesn't carry over when you replace your phone.  The cloud account could be better.  I would like the cloud to store and suggest.  The ability to add notes.    I have been using OverDrive for years every day.  It is easy to check out books from the library.  You will need to download an Adobe reader to read books, but after it is set up it is easy to use.",

The books that aren't at my library can be recommended for the library to purchase. However the process doesn't work for me. It opens the page to recommend and the email/hold notification option is given but once I select to either recommend or cancel, and I hit recommend, it doesn't go through and send the recommendation. I even went to the browser site and tried with the same results. I need to know why this isn't working and how it can be fixed. I Would give overdrive 5 stars if not for this VERY frustrating issue. Help?",

I read 3-5 books  a week for entertainment and it is very handy to be able to check out a book any time day or night. I can read books on my phone or tablet, listen to audio books at home or in the car. I can adjust the brightness and size of the print so reading is comfortable. It is easy to carry several books at a time, you can set your checkout periods, and I don't have to worry about misplacing books or have them overdue",

What I needed is the ability to sync across platforms (tablet and phone), ability to borrow books from the local library, and the ability to read open ePub books. This does it all.  I do tend to download the Kindle formats (if available) as Kindle is a better ereader. The built in reader could be better at reproducing the publishers format. Some ePub books don't always render correctly, especially older books.",

There are sooo many books available for your immediate reading or listening pleasure also.

I hate that there is no zoom in feature. I have read books that have pictures with some kind of caption on them which I could not read because I could not zoom in. Also it does not allow me to jump straight to a footnote so it is absolute torture when you are reading a book full of footnotes which are at the end of the chapter (or at the end of a book) so you really cannot read them unless you are incredibly patient.   For the love of God fix the footnote issue!!!",

I like that even with all of the updates over the years it has continued to be smooth, stable, and user friendly.  I read in night mode since the darker background is easier on my eyes and I'm convinced that it helps with battery life on OLED screens.  I don't like the number of taps it takes to get to the Loans screen to download books that I've checked out now.  I recall when it took less toggling.  However, books are very easy to access once downloaded.  Bookmarking is also easy and intuitive once reading has begun.  Of note, I still make trips to the library as well since I don't want those to go the way of video rental stores when digital movies were universally adopted.",

I like that it's easy to switch from night reading to day reading. I haven't come across any bugs at all. That's what happens when a company invests in development instead of marketing.

If you request it, it also takes a very long time for them to have it available, if not at all. Over all, it beats any app out there. You can download any book and have it offline to listen to so you won't use your data all the time.",

Only thing is that some items don't have enough copies and you have to put them on \"hold\" and wait until another person is done with it. If it's an e-version of an audiobook I don't get why there can't be unlimited copies of each item. Overall I like this enough to give 5 stars.",

Tried Liby, & like that you can keep track of what you read through the Tag system.  But everything takes an effort to do, ie adding the 2nd tag to thumbs up, thumbs down to keep track of read books throws me everytime. I get it done, but because instructions do not flow: i stumble: displaying the book cover with Tag symbol below. When I get there,  I've tried so many ways don't retrain the steps. The taged books I think are in\"order of adding\", instead of alphabetical  by author, & date published so easy to find.",

I love just about everything about it expect the fact when one looks up an author/book and none of their books are within the library, one does not get suggestions on other authors or books like what was searched. Although, you do get to look at books by the author and recommend some to the app for insight on what they should buy next. Good for every reader type.",

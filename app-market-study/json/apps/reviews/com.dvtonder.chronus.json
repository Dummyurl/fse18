Usually it is about 10\u00b0 off from the local weather station (which is generally accurate). Today the app said it was 73\u00b0 outside when it was actually 50\u00b0. I don't recommend you rely on this app for weather.",

        "comment": "Nice idea but poor implementation. Far too easy to hit clock instead of settings icon, especially when widget is maximised. If clock is not displayed, settings icon is missing. The clock doesn't align with those of Dashclock and Better Dashclock on my other desktops. Ugly alignment of widgets (especially Dashclock widgets);which are far too close to each other, in both Dash and Flex. The Flex widget is ironically inflexible, with the order of elements fixed and, furthermore, the rss ticker forces Dashclock widgets into a single row above it that cannot be scrolled either - so I can't even expand the fourth one,  even if my child's fingers *weren't* too fat to launch one. Doesn't find all the Dashclock widgets I have installed. Last, and most significantly, you can't rate the demo version. If these issues (starting with the Flex widget and the rss issue) are fixedI'll consider rating it higher - as it is though, I'll have to stick with my current arrangement.",

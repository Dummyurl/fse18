        "comment": "This app is actually very good. However I gave it 3 stars because it is missing smart home devices that should be there. For example. Nest is there but no camera set up. No August smart Lock. No voice assistant like Google home. No tp link etc. The app has so much potential if more devices are added. The interface is very nice. Add those devices and I would pay for the app if it was not free. But in meantime I've uninstalled. Will check in periodically.. keep up the good work",

The support was amazing too! The gentlemen went out of his way to go about testing problems I was having with my WeMo. He sent me updates every day too! A++ service",

The only problem I have is that the \"use 24h clock\" option is set to off, yet my watch is still set to 24h mode no matter if it's on or off. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not. Only thing I would change is that it would be nice to be able to scroll to the next option on the watch face rather than having to tap that tiny little arrow.    UPDATE 1/11/17 Hey Muzzley team! Thanks for the reply. I've tried to manually change the time to 12 hour mode on my watch, as well as just syncing the time to my phone. The Muzzley watch face still shows in 24h format no matter what settings I choose. All of my other watch faces update to 12/24 mode without a problem, so it's definitely got to be a bug with Muzzley. I'm happy to continue testing things if you have any ideas!",

The UI looks pretty good, but the widgets are large and clunky as is the shortcuts screen in app. Seems like they are more concerned with showing off their graphic skills than making a functional app. Minimalistic is key; especially with widgets.",

And sometimes it won't pull up at all, even when connected to WiFi.  People that come to my door are long gone before I can ever get a live signal to see who was there.  My Vivint system at home sucks too.   I constantly have to reboot my doorbell cam because it stops working all of the sudden, and often have to reboot my entire system because it starts to act buggy.  There is also such a lag time in the doorbell cam from when it detects a visitor, to the time it starts recording, that when I try to go back and see who was there, it won't show them if they came and left quickly, or it will only show their back for a split second as they walk out of view.  I've had it with this system.  When my contract is up it's bye bye Vivint!",

My space monkey that is suppose to record everything doesnt.  Iv had there service for over 6 months now and I regret ever install the system at my home. I tried to return the system but the wont take it back.    Stay away is the only advice i can give you. Purchase at your own risk!!",

And when we called they said sorry we can't see anything even though the guy told us theres constant video going.  They also never told us that you can't leave the contract. And also never told us that if we paid a little extra a month we wont have to pay when they have to come out and replace something that's not our fault.

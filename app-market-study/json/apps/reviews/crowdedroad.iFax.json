I also could not open faxes received with out extra charge. This was within the one week free trial too. Even when I agreed to the charge because I needed the fax, once I opened it the fax disappeared. I could never retrieve it. I emailed the developer multiple time the response was \"App ticket was closed and merged into this request\" or \"your request is registered as CC on this request.\" Finally, they sent an email stating they found no problems with the account and they sent a fax without a problem. I return the email restating I can't open the faxes received as I stated in previous emails. They had no suggestions. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY.",

Edit, I discovered that you could use with tasker to trigger notification based events great addition",

Regarding security I received this information from the developer: The codes are stored in a secure data area specific to the app.  If your phone is not rooted then it's protected.  If you have a rooted phone then other apps can access this area and could read the codes.  If you make a backup then this file sits on the root folder available for anything to read so I'd advise moving it to a cloud store or similar.\"",

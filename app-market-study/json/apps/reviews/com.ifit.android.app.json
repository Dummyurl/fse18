However, I'd like to plan routes to run on my treadmill via the app. Why do I have to be logged in to a pc to do this? It's difficult to do on the treadmill, as well.  PC seems to be the only viable option. Overall,  great app. I like it! Also what is the ifit score? How is it computed and does it change based on length, speed or # of days worked out?",

When I logged out to try again, I lost all of my workouts in the upload queue (30+). Was hoping this would work and sync to my laptop and my iFit treadmill. Nope. Only place I seem to be successful is on the laptop. Lot of good that does me when I'm trying to be mobile and fit. My scheduled workouts do not show on the app. Using this app on my Android phone.",

        "comment": "I've been using this for about 2 weeks on a Sony Smartwatch 3 (SW3).  It seems to eat up about 1%/min of the battery life compared to \"My Tracks\" which uses about 0.2%/min.  That is a bit high and means that a long hike event will require a recharge of the SW3. I did have issues with the upload to the ifit database for a while.  For the past 4 uses, it has worked perhaps by following the process of ... 1) Starting the IFIT app on the SW3 while in BT range of the host android device and choosing the type of activity, 2) Run,  Run,  Run,  3) Stop the activity on the SW3 IFIT app within BT range of the host.  I did not start any other SW3 app during the entire process including music etc.   I'm not sure that there was any magic in this process but so far so good.   However, I can't get the Polar HRM strap to connect/collect with this app however that could be an issue with the SW3 android wear OS.",

Sadly this thing is so complicated and doesn't even come with proper institutions you have to look em up online. On top of that we couldn't get ours to turn on and stay on they would turn right back off. And I couldn't get my phone to pick up the device on Bluetooth. Yes the reviews you read are true don't waste your money. My husband just left to go return them at the store.",

It pretends to do another ride when you restart, but it won't actually get logged. 5. Layout for Wear is only square watch face. No round, looks like garbage on Moto 360. 6. Bad wear UX. When I swipe to see the ride during the ride, don't ask if I want to open the app. Just open the app. 7. Can't see stats on phone if using wear app.",

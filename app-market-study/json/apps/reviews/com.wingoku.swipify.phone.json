Also despite me having it off in the settings, the multi-tasker is still there. Lastly, the quick setting toggles do not work on my Nexus 6; this is a fantastic feature but I hope the Dev can fix this and the other bugs with this app. Very convenient app and highly recommend it, despite the bugs.",

This could be a problem with my watch because I was also having trouble with wear mini launcher (but this is different altogether) but could you please try and fix this because I love this launcher. Other than that when the background is solid this is a great launch",

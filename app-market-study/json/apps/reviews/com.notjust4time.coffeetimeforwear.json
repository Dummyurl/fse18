Fast forward to now, and I find out that my new Android watch won't be able to get the Starbucks app on it, because Starbucks never developed an app for Android Wear. Luckily I discovered this third party solution, downloaded it on my new LG Watch Style, and tested it out at Starbucks. Worked without a hitch. It actually works more consistently than the official Starbucks app on the Apple Watch did. I'm sold. Thank you for developing this app. I look forward to seeing the Coffee Time watch face soon.",

I can get the app just fine on my phone, it just won't show up on the watch.  Please add Huawei watch back to the list of supported devices!",

App doesn't reliably push the card number to both watches and even when you do get it set up (note: I have no trick for this, it's just keep trying until it automagically works)  flying-spaghetti-monster forbid you made a typo as that's even harder to fix.   Though at the end of the day, the look you get when you pay with your watch does indeed make it all worthwhile - and since Starbucks has forsaken Android Wear users with it's official app I'm grateful this one exists.",

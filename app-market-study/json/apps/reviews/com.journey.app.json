So I'm hanging out for this atm to see if it stops me from writing. But so far, I'm enjoying it more than the last one which is what I was hoping for. Please don't kick me out! I need this journaling app or my life will be in chaos!!",

I use OneDrive and would like to see backup and sync options,  using that.  Others use DropBox, which is also missing. For Fitness,  I use Samsung Health and also MyFitnessPal,  not Google Fit,  which is the only fitness service supported.    Straight away,  I was put off because I am not going to change multiple services to try this one.",

It still says stationary on every diary entry no matter what I am doing and I have to manually change it to none.  Please add option to turn off the auto detection of your current activity. It is always wrong and I hate having to manually change it. Would prefer to have it show no activity unless you want to add it. I don't like being forced to use a feature I don't want. Otherwise 5 stars. I paid for the premium and I like it.",

I enjoy the feel, the ease of use, the tags, the ability to add photos (and gifs), and tracking locations and weather.   Outside of journaling, I also use it as a recipe tracker, and I'm sure there are many other uses for it. It's a wonderful app.  One thing though: I would give 4.5 if I could, only because there is no option to search through your tags. Possibly I'm doing it wrong by creating 100's of tags, but it's a pain when I need to scroll through a majority of them. If I could search for the tag I wanted this would easily be a 5.",

I added the widget to directly open camer in home page, yet it tkaes multiple clicks. Its very annoying to do this every time, would be nice if there is a way to get to camera in this apps context in just one click...two intermediate steps looks unnecessary - one window to choose +icon...when i click on camera button, it is always a first photo in a new event, so thats window not required...2nd window to choose video/camera which i can do in camera app itself..that also not required",

If any journal so is worth your money, this one is. I forget what I paid for it, but whatever it was is worth it.  I am almost a week in using this app at the time I write this review. I first had a problem where my software keyboard refused to work correctly. 2 App Studio got back really fast to help fix my problem. It managed to work itself out and now works great! Now I get why everyone has given 4 or 5 stars. I would like to see a feature where you can take multiple pictures per journal entry and then get to pick which one you want for the title picture, but there are easy workarounds to this. Great product.",

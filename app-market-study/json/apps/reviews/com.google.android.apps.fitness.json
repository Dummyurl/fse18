There is no way to force a manual sync for real time data either. Wanting to pair with my fitness pal like I did with my fitbit charge but doesn't work anywhere near as good. Expect much better from Google's own apps and software working together.",

Total inconsistency between the steps on watch and phone, even though they are in sync (same goals, weight, height updates appear on both devices).

Not interested in workouts or being location tracked 24 hours a day, just want a basic step count to show up on my phone.",

This app does not sync properly between multiple devices. It is like the app on my watch and the app on my phone operate independently even though it is the same account on both. And don't even bother with customer service/support. There is a lot of potential, but unfortunately it needs a lot of work. Overall I'm very disappointed.",

        "comment": "After writing my initial review, I've done some pondering, and my opinion of Google Fit has kinda done a 180. The point of this app is to be a central hub with really really good activity logging built in. Nutrition logging and pre-made workouts isn't the point - the point is to bring all those services that other developers do better and to put a central focus on goals. I love how I can connect all the services I love to one app, and look and have a quick glance of my day. Despite this, there are some things I would like. A health coach would be nice, especially with Google's Machine learning, some mild sleep tracking would be nice, but not important. What I'd really like is a deeper dive into my Fit-created data such as the ability to tab on my goals and get a more comprehensive breakdown, but it still does its job as a data hub really well.",

Data on phone doesn't match on watch or online, according to online and watch i've done 0 steps, yet on phone it shows 16K, if I check different app on watch it shows 16K, but not GF it says 0 - online it shows done x amount of walking, while on my phone it shows only 1/4 of the figure and on watch 0. this app can't be relied on as the data is so incorrect. if it wasn't for runtastic or huawei health I wouldn't be able to see my data correctly.

Rating 2 stars   Update 1:   I got a fit bit, it worked perfectly but is not integrated as much as AW watches.  So, I pulled out my Moto 360 again and tried Fit to see if it improved.  I could not get it to track steps on my watch.  The good news is that I just updated my watch.  A new Huawei Watch and guess what, Google fit does not work at all.  it does not track steps.  Two thumbs down.  The Huawei software works fine.  I will try other apps but I think Google Fit has wasted enough of my time. I really want it to work but alas...it does not.  I want to remove it from my phone and watch both but now it looks like it is integrated into the OS on both. Rating 1 star.  Update 2: I tried to delete the app but could only deactivate it and delete all the data off my phone.  I just could not leave well enough alone and eventually tried it again.   I was able to connect the Wuawei fitness app to Fit via the Wuawei app.  Fit started to work. Seems to work ok now.  Rating 3 stars.  Update...new watch LG watch Sport ....sync does not work well.  App is a an absolute failure.",

        "comment": "Despite mirroring settings for workouts between fit app on wear and fit app on phone, the way notifications work is slightly different.  Within the fit app:  On wear 24 during my run, the spoken feedback is total time, total distance, and then AVG pace (in minutes per mile)  On phone, during my run, the spoken feedback is total time, total distance, and then pace from Last mile (in minutes) ^I prefer this and would love to be able to have this configuration on my wear watch. Not sure if the difference is an intentional decision.",

And to keep my location on for this app, is really draining my phones battery and it is NOT accurate. I thought I'd give it a try, but it's a waste of time. All other reviews seem to see the same problem.",

But the fact the it has wrong information recorded and cannot remove it is not acceptable. User can't remove the misc activity, which in my case is almost always wrong. Motorbike or bus rides are mistaken for cycling.",

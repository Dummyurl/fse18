        "comment": "Love the app and have had very few problems with it. It's useful to monitor engine codes,  driving styles,  and the idiots on the road around you. The problems are clarity of image and exposure.  I have difficulty reading license plates (auto focus issue? Not sure what the difference is with the 3 auto focus settings) when reviewing images to report carpool violators and the manual adjustment for tint is impractical in changing conditions.  When it's cloudy and there is a sun break the image ends up washed out badly and I don't think this adjustment should be messed with while driving.   Would buy again",

Only issues is white balance whilst recording is either non-existent or extremely slow. I'd also like a widget with even just 2 buttons, one to return to app and another to protect recording, the floating button is to small to safely use. If it had a parking mode also, THAT would make it a top 3 app. Awesome work! Highly recommended, and don't skimp out and buy the pro version!",

        "comment": "Not happy now. Says it's recording but when I go to find files for the previous day, it hasn't actually started to record anything for a full hour after starting my drive. Very disappointing. When it does record,  the device has to be kept cool or the video capture will glitch and becomes worse as it gets hotter. I have to keep my air conditioning vents pointed directly at it but then making sure you remove the device from the dash and stow it out of the sun when not in use. When used with an OBD2 device, turbocharger diagnostics do not seem to be available which is a real disappointment. Deleting video files can take a very long time. But sometimes the files can become locked and will not delete without plugging it into a PC. This can result in the device's SD card filling up and not allowing CaroO to record any more. Since updating to nougat, text response areas such as \"cancel\" or \"ok\" have become garbled.",

        "comment": "I just spent \u00a3200 to have halfords fit a Nextbase 512GW which makes me an IDIOT because apart from a bit better quality video, and recording in quicktime, Caroo does everything and more that the Nextbase pain in the arse does.   My phone goes in a cradle above the dash, in a Doblo it is not in the way,  it tells me in BIG NUMBERS how fast I am going and with the OBD bluetooth pretty much anything I want to know about the engine.  The Nextbase is a royal pain in the arse to clip in and out every time I go out, can't leave it in the car, it has to be jammed right up behind the rear view mirror and I can't even use its 'speed' function because the law says it has to be out the way when driving.   I am an IDIOT. What a waste of money.  I might try the Nextbase stuck on the dash, downside up, with the screen set to just show speed but for all the bells and whistles promised by the Nextbase... Save your money, get an old android phone and use Caroo..P.S. samsung galaxy S lll mini with a big sd card gives me upto hours continual record time. Trip to bonnie Scotland... Anyone who has problems with it.. It might be an idea to list your phone type so the developer can see it and work a fix :",

I wish the UI followed Android UX guidelines, but it isn't ugly by any measure.  A minor wishlist item is hidden intents to start and stop recording (so one can integrate with Tasker et al).

I know you want to improve your app but right now the best way for you to do that is to reduce data usage. Otherwise your consumers will go to other platforms that uses less data.",

It's not like Whatsapp video calling where you can make your camera bigger to see your own face big if you want. Also, please add better & realistic filters with better color quality like on instagram. \ud83d\ude06 Please fix this feature & make it like Whatsapp! Thanks!",

Uses too much data and it's really unnecessary to first install Facebook @ 500mb and then install messenger which is part of Facebook at 300mb. It's really doesn't make sense unless this was done deliberately to scam users. I am sure you would note this feedback and create another app with both FB and messenger with a smaller interface for vigilantes like myself",

Plus the liker emoticon on every msgs is super annoying. Even if you don't want to tap it, they'd tapped. I hope you have personal option on it to turned it on and off. It's ok to innovated the app but if the innovation is so awful and make it hassle to the part of consumer mind as well removed that liker. We don't want to frustrate the one that we chat just because we accidentally tap the sad emoticon.",

I couldn't even uninstall messenger because the I couldn't select \"yes\" to the \"are you sure you want to uninstall\" question, I tried uninstalling multiple ways, every possibly way you can, none worked. Honestly, I'm considering using another way to keep in touch with my girlfriend, texting isn't instant, but I refuse to deal with this and I already don't trust Facebook. I wouldn't have even been able to reset my entire phone because I wouldn't have been able to select \"yes\" when trying to do it. This app is becoming absolute junk. No one cares about half the bloat you put on it, it's just more useless stuff.",

I did everything from sharing through the app to re-installing to restarting my phone. I sent a report, but I don't expect too much considering the last time I did, it was to make y'all aware that my cousin's Facebook had me taken over by a stranger!! That was October and here we are in March. That person still occupies her name, but with a different face. Also, your calls keep dropping. Its all jacked up. Are you guys trying to lose people?!?",

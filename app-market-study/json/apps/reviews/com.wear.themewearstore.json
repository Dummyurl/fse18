It's  a neat concept: track your exercise levels, set personal goals, earn reward points for excerising and for achieving your personal goal, then use those points to get stuff you want, including gift  cards, or upgrades for the smart watch you almost certainly own if you continue using this app long enough to earn sufficient points to purchase anything.  Without a smart watch, though, this app doesn't really do much of anything. You can set it to track your activity level using just the accelerometer on your phone, and user input data, but - at least in my case - my phone isn't sensitive enough, or reliable enough, to track my activity level with any satisfying degree of accuracy.  Additionally, the user interface leaves something to be desired: glitching while creating an account, forcing login through facebook, failing to clarify a unit of measurement when inputting your height, etc.  Neat concept,, probably great for some. For me though, it was pointless.",

Just playing with the app on my phone it does seem like a really useful app to help keep track of physical activity etc. It's a little irritating that it constantly goes to the store rather than the my fitness page, so there's a lot of button presses needed to get to your information. Could maybe use some guidelines to help with setup as well.",

        "comment": "For whatever reason... Roku decided to put the shortest cord ever on the remote receiver. Therefore it doesn't reach long enough from the outlet to the top or aide of my t.v.. It barely pokes around the side and sits inbyhe floor....To use the standard remote, one must awkwardly position themselves directly in the path of the remote receiver and point the remote right at it. Such a pain when I am comfy and don't wanna move from my side of the bed, reach across hubby and point the remote. With the app, I can be in another room and click away and the signal is perfect every time... No more awkward reaching of remotes.",

I've tried reinstalling, refreshing etc as per troubleshooting faq. Still doesn't work. I'd like refund or better than that - a fix. UPDATE Victor - I saw you'd mentioned this option to someone else so tried that and it still doesn't work. Makes a beeping nose and a volume - and + appears on the screen but doesn't actually change the volume :( UPDATE 2 - Ok. Thank you. I've already submitted a refund request via google and they confirmed a refund is on the way. Will amend my rating as the free app works well. Cheers for trying to fix for me.",

        "comment": "I received a Roku Stick for Christmas over 2 years ago. The remote never worked right. It usually took at least 10 minutes to turn the Roku on with the remote and I often spent 20-30 minutes of frustration without luck. I finally gave up the other day after 45 minutes of failure and threw the remote out. In desparation I searched for another way to turn the Roku on and I found this RoByte app. Let's just say that I am ecstatic. It works PERFECTLY. I read the problems that other people were having with volume. I am able to adjust the volume with the tv remote. There is no problem. This RoByte app is wonderful! Thank you!",

I'd like it to link to a shopping and kitchen storage app. I'd like it to let me assemble a weeks worth of connected menus and integrate it with my shopping list. But that's being picky. If you want a recipe app then look no further, you've found the best.",

Furthermore, it seams that the meal planner feature isn't available anymore without sync.  To sum up, it's easy to manage your recipes. Good, light, nice design. But I stay uncertain about pricing politics and available features in the different available  subscriptions.",

My favorite function is to go the recipe webpage, choose \"share\" to My Cookbook and the instructions and photos are imported in. All I have to do is add categories and tags. It even save the source HTML. Love this. The meal plan function is lame though. I mean... It works...but not very well integrated into the app. Hopefully, it'll improve in the future :)",

Beautiful, clean, one page layout. You don't  have to click through multiple pages (like pintrest and yummly). Easy to find online recipes, though not all websites work (tops paprika because it imports nutrition and can have multiple pictures).  You can add notes or your own pics, great for customizing to your taste. You can type in or import hour own recipes (yummly can't ) and sharing recipes is easy (paprika doesn't allow exporting). I can't speak to the shopping list, but I do like having cloud storage so I can look my recipes up anywhere, including the grocery store parking lot. My one wish is that it would share with my fitness pal so I could easily add nutrition to my food tracking.",

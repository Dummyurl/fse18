If you have a card not listed (like a public library card) it has a feature to create your own card, but when the new bar code is used it throws in extra numbers before the library card number.  You can't use a logo you got from their website for graphics, you can only access your camera to take a picture of the logo.  Hokey.  The nearby stores feature is useless to me, apparently that only works in France (I think).",

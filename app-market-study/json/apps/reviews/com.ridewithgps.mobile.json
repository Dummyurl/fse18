        "comment": "So here is one for developers , first off what kind of professional app does not have an undo functionality when you accidentally delete a ride? This app should have it. Second : today I went for a ride after my ride I saved it & named it , saved it, I then thought of a better name for it so went back to rename it only to realize that even if you rename it it does not change the name of the ride when you actually share it on another app say what's up or SMS. I then thought well I will delete my online version that uploaded from my phone and then upload my phone version with the correct name. After I did this I lost my ride, the app also deleted my phone version! . This is poor programming design and for a professional app it's unacceptable. Thankfully I also had my Strava file and was able to import it",

Every other GPS enabled app on my phone works perfectly, so why RWGPS seems completely unable to find me is a real mystery. I've tried the app in my garden, in the street outside my house and even in my local town centre, but it still can't seem to find me.   UPDATE  After emailing the excellent customer support at RWGPS they have explained to me how to fix this issue. I have therefore changed my rating to 5 stars.",

        "comment": "Great app, i have tried quite a few workout trackers and I keep coming back to this one. I wish there was a way to set up workouts so that you could program in a few full day of workouts and then create your workout based around plugging in the days to your schedule. For example I am on a workout that goes \"ABA\" the first week, and \"BAB\" the second week. It would be nice to be able to create two days of workouts then set it up in a schedule as opposed to manually configuring every workout for the two week period.",

        "comment": "Truly amazing app! I used to use Redy Gym but have been pulled away by all of the thoughtful little features of Progression Tracker. I love that when I complete a set, it moves on to the next exercise, the rest timer is a floating holo button, so if I leave the app, the timer is still visible, and the ease of building and updating my own program is amazing. And that's all just in the Free version. Statistics and graphs of your progress can be unlocked in the Pro version if you desire. But the core features are all Free which is just fantastic! I am definitely upgrading and the dev truly deserves it. Thanks a ton Zoltan!",

If they could make everyone have a log in profile that you could save your workouts to, this would solve the issue.  This could also help to be able to share a workout plan.  I always work out with my girlfriend and if we are going to do a new workout plan, we each have to spend about 20 minutes plugging in each exercise.",

And this one doesn't have all the extra junk like jefit or fitocracy. Wish it still supported dropbox, as Google Drive doesn't seem to be working. I like the additional support for Google Fit though. One silly question: to get accurate tracking of weight lifted, should dumbbell exercises be logged with the combined weight, or weight per dumbbell?",

        "comment": "The ability to quickly set up your own routine, complete with supersets, drop sets, etc. is extremely handy. The interface is also very clean and easy to use, and having the charts of your lifting progress in-app and available to look at any time is awesome.   HOWEVER. I should note that paying for the app to get the \"export\" feature is pointless. The only thing that is exported from the app is your TOTALS for each day. So if you were hoping to look at your progress over time in a specific exercise, say squats, using nicer graphing tools on a desktop computer, the only way to do that is manually looking through your logs and typing it yourself :(. If the app is updated to export all your data for each lift to .csv and not just totals, I would definitely increase the rating to 5 stars.",

I just add notes under exercise week2 add a set or week 4 60% of max and so on.  Then next month phase 2....so you get the point. Just one way to be able to program multiple routines in if that's your preference. If there's an exercise note in library, it's easy to create and then you are good. Wish there was a way to export to excel or my Google account (there might be but I haven't found it yet). Overall great app.  If I could add anything it would be a phase function. Like I stated above program a routine then set it up based on weeks so each week reps/sets change accordingly. Then it automatically bumps you to your phase 2 routine that's programed (each routine needs to be able to have different workouts-mon/wed/fri-or whatever schedule you pick then sets/reps/wt changes for each week). I know that's something easy you guys could add....just in case you were bored one day.           Thanks for your work on this app.",

I also really like how I can fine tune my workouts from the templates to make them exactly  what I want; the only thing that would make it better is the ability to design my own exercise, because (for example) I like to do some sorts of body weight exercises which aren't always in the catalogue.  It's well worth the $7ish to unlock for the cool graphs too -- I find it keeps me motivated.",

The material design is great and the app just predicts exactly what you need to do. The ability to use pre-defined workout splits is great, and you can even edit them further! I love all the built in things like a rest time and even a set timer. Honestly I have not found one bad thing about this app and I've used it for months. Way to go, devs.",

Also please add an in app RM calculator so i don't have to use other app to calculate RMs. And it will be more awesome if the RM calculator is available beside the input weight so when you calculate RMs and chose to use weight in a certain percentage you can just click it and it will populate the text box of weight input :)",

Very easy to work within, you'll pick up how the app works within a day of using it. Definitely worth getting if you take your training seriously - especially for powerlifters who want to track their daily volume/tonnage as well as statastics.  Would recommend 100x over.",

        "comment": "This is what I've been looking for for years! Takes the pain out of tracking workouts and knowing what weight you need to be doing to progress from pervious sessions. The stats are invaluable too. It works best if you have a set schedule that you follow, so you don't need to create a brand new workout each time.  The only reason for not quite hitting the 5 star, is because when you enter a manual workout afterwards (rather than tracking as you workout) it can cause Google fit data to corrupt - I've submitted a report so hoping it will get fixed. Once done it will hands down make this the perfect app to support strength training.  (Paying for the full version is definitely worth it!)",

The only thing keeping it from five stars is the weights are in kg only - which is fine by me, but since I'm in American gyms, half the weights only have lbs on them and that means I have to do the translation.  Give it the option to switch from kg to lb and it'll be perfect.",

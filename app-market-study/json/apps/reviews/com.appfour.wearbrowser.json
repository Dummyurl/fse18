It takes forever for pages to load up, but it gets the job done, it does load up most pages for the most part and videos do work on pages so good job on that. But my biggest issue with this is that the \"free\" version is always pushing adds on you to buy the premium version of this. I ended up coughing up a few dollars to get the premium, but guess what, when you buy the premium version it doesn't save to your Google account. So if you were to reset your watch or get a new smart watch and sign in, you'd have to pay for it again! Not sure what the policies were, but I definitely feel like I shouldn't have to buy it again.",

The problem I encountered is that when the keyboard comes up to enter website logon credentials it clips half of the leftmost and rightmost character of the top line. You can still type in the characters though using a stylus. When attempting to enter a password using the special characters button,  the leftmost and rightmost numbers 1 and 0, on the first keyboard line are not visible. They are totally clipped.",

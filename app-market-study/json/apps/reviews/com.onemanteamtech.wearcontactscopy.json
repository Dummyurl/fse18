With Android now on Marshmallow, and the upcoming N, this was built around Lollipop. I can go into the app, set my contacts and it sometimes removes the contacts. But instead of it resyncing itself, I have to uncheck and then recheck those I want to save to my watch. Late update was in 2015 and its now almost 2017... Any updates scheduled",

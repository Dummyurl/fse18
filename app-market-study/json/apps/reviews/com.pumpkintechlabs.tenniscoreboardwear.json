It would be nice if the app would stay open when we force the screen to go black to preserve battery life (will give 5* when added & scoring fixed). The long press to get to the settings is not the most initiative way to get to the settings. I would also like to see the app work on the phone. Could make picking settings easier and would be nice to have the same functionality without the watch. Thanks!",

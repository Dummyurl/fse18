Update: since it uses Bluetooth I see that as a weak point. A cast of more than 40 ft is out of range, the closer to u the better the results.",

        "comment": "The idea of it is cool, although I feel it lacks some necessary detail. A more clear scan would make this tremendously better. I tried switching back and forth from the sonar screen to the fish screen, and any random dot above the floor is considered a fish, and at times it would show weeds where there clearly weren't any. The depth seemed decently accurate as I cross checked it with a map of the lake, but as far as what it considers to be fish or structure, I am skeptical.   I would like to see the ability to change the frequency to get a better picture. There is no advanced feature to twerk settings, and I think that would be great.   Does better on boat then on shore, as I didnt have to cast it, and it stayed within 5 feet from me. Casting from shore, it disconnects past 20 feet.   Overall cool idea, but I think I would go with a different product.  Edit 1/17--- Would be nice if there was an update for ice fishing. So far it's only been useful to check depth. Could be a great tool with a little firmware update.",

As soon as i got it i charged it up to full then placed it in a sink full of water in kitchen. Then i connected my phone to it and installed latest firmware.      I took it out for its first venture and it was very helful . Where i was fishing was known to be weedy but this showed me where the clear spots were and where the shelves were for me to fish.. this will be with me every trip.",

Tried mapping the bottom of the same spot with it, it was a little better view of the bottom but still cartoon like and garbage details.",

I was able to take a picture, give the scene a name but after inputting my \"new artist name\" I wasn't able to continue. Please fix this, as this seems like just the app I was looking for!",

Won't recommend unless the app is a flat price of $10 or less. I'd prefer that we could have up to 5 or so of our own goshes stored in the app for free (stored in the app meaning don't base on number created, base on number of custom goshes I have stored in app). It allowed me to create goshes until now. Now, even when I delete others, it still won't let me. Ripoff. Update 6 months later: Still a rip-off.",

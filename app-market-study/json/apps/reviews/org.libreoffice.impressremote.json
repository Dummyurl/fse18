It still doesn't work like the video you've shown. I am running Xperia Z2 5.1.1, my laptop is Windows 8.1. Libreoffice Impress version 4.4.5.2 on Windows8.1. I'll edit this comment to inform if everything worked out.",

However, for Windows 7 and 8 laptops, this app fails to finds computers or unable to connect to specific IPs on the network; always reports \"Connection failed\".  Tried app on iPad mini as well as Android 4.4 cell.  Tried disabling firewall altogether in Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines and even specifying the IP address of the computer running Impress but the app still can't find the computer!  Great app but not workable for me in Windows 7 or 8.  Running LibreOffice 5.1.3 on Windows.  Does anyone running Windows 7 or 8 have the same problem? anyone with a solution? Need it to work on Windows 7 or 8!!!",

        "comment": "I used to carry extra long VGA and USB cables so that I could position my laptop on a rostrum and to one side of a presentation. No longer so! Thank you Impress Remote. I recommend just using a hand held lasar pointer and don't give up on Bluetooth connection problems - it does work! My own problems with Bluetooth are due to a poor laptop and not this App. For large auditoriums or where the Bluetooth range is poor, definitely set up a WiFi connection. Now my laptop can be wired and left close to the data projector, and I just stand nearby, tablet in hand. Much better for audience attention as I can move about. Highly recommended. Improvements? Better resolution for the notes on handheld devices would be nice, but not essential. For some reason hidden slides in a presentation are shown by this App, the workaround is easy - save and use an abridged presentation.",

I know they are my notes, you don't have to tell me and I want the screen space. I would also love functionality where I could set times starting a specific slide. (i.e. save a time to a slide such that when I get to it stops the previous timer and starts a new timer).",

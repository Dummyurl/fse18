Majority of my connections over 4G Globe network here (I'm in the Philippines) timeout, for which the app locks the UI for 1 minute while it waits for the timeout (poor error handling, UX) so I can't try again quickly - I have to wait the full minute. Even over wifi, many times it takes 1+ minute while I sit here and stare at the screen for it to unlock (Sasspass server has poor performance/lag overseas). Bluetooth proximity unlock isn't available for my LG G3 android phone (poor compatibility), so the best/fastest/most reliable way to log into my computer is to open the Saaspass app, get a \"computer login\" code and type it manually with my computer login, which basically reduces the app to a simple key generator. This is painful.",

I was a little hesitant after reading some reviews that were less than stellar. Now after installing, I think some of the reviewers failed to follow instructions, or blamed it for doing what it should. A few recommendations based on my experience. Saaspass is a security swiss army knife. For the computer, it throws on a 2FA requirement to your Mac or PC.",

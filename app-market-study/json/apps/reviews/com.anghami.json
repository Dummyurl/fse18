Anghami seemed really nice to me at first but now the app downloads songs on its own and annoys me. I had to sit down and personally delete the songs I don't want . This is really annoying and disastrous. I want to move on but this app is the only decent one I can find in this country. Please improve!!",

I can't believe some people are nagging about this. And Soundcloud is nothing like this app, it's mostly indie free music.",

Why the repeat button and the replay button ( the button that makes the track to start from the beginning ) are not working? And why it's no longer applicable to get the song to play from any point on it's length? I can repeat the song by choosing it again from the list that includes it as soon as the next song starts, so does this way reduces the costs that you pay for each and every time i play or repeat a song?   Edit: the new version is now nice Edit: why is the \"music automatic switching off timer\" in a specified time frame (for example 30 minutes and 1 hour, 2 hours) no longer available now? It was a really lovely option",

I'm subscribed to the monthly format and i recommend to lower the fees to 1- 1.5$ so we end up paying 12-18$ per year. In addition i recommend you to make aghani to compete with shazam.

This is just an awful strategy to force people to subscribe to the paid version and I don't like being forced into buying something, I'd rather not use it at all, besides you have ad's for the free version isn't this enough?. Therfore 1 star is more than enough... For now EDIT: THANKS ANGHAMI TEAM FOR LISTENING TO OUR REVIEWS AND BRINGING BACK THE SEEK  THROUGH THE LONG SONGS AND THE SKIP FUNCTION ALSO, NOW I CAN LISTEN TO MY FAVOURITE PART OF (TARAB) SONGS WITHOUT HAVING TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE SONG.

Other times I'll try to flip to my front camera and it won't respond there either. If the connection isn't lightning fast, the connection can drop completely. The phone heats up BIG time during video chat (which I know may not be something they can fix). To say the least, they've got a lot to improve on.",

One of the greatest feature of this app is it shows the text of another person while we are having a video call. This makes people can do another task simultaneously. But another problem I have, my phone gets really slow when I have a video call while texting. However, it is still a great app!",

A little hard to figure out at first, too many motions for some basic features, hang up for instance is tap screen first then press hang up button but it does use all the real estate your phone offers for video. Call quality has improved to where it should be: equal or better than actual calling if you have high speed (5mbps both directions) so it's great for when you're roaming the world.",

Fundamentally, I have made good video calls with this app, but It has a bit of a tendency to show things over the video feed that get in the way of seeing the video and sometimes it decides to hide part or all of the video feed. It's good enough for what I use it for, but I docked it  a star for those quirks",

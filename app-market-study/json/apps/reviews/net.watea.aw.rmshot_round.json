This should be an option, don't care if I'm missing some of the image   wtf?  emailed dev, no response.  what would also be nice is a button to force on the light.  No response.  Don't waste your money.  Try something else like PixtoCam, that does video and you can force the light on in that mode.",

        "comment": "I used to have an LG G4 and paired it with the LG Watch Urbane. Since the application had a native app, I didn't need a third party remote shutter.  However, when I had to switch phones and switched to the Samsung Galaxy Note FE, the remote shutter thing on my watch is my most missed feature on my old phone. Note that I still have the Urbane as my daily driver as it ain't broke yet.  I was hesitant to buy this at first due to the lack of (legitimate) reviews, and after trying it out, it's definitely works. The black bars shouldn't really bother you., and it's better this way as that's the same way how the native remote shutter app works when I had an LG phone.  Things I liked: 1.) Ability to stream the shot from your phone to your watch, much like the old native remote shutter app. 2.) More fine controls like setting up the timer and flash from the watch 3.) Can still take pictures even with the flip cover closed 4.) Silent shots Things to improve: 1.) Ability to store pictures on SD card 2.) Ability to take videos. 3.) I literally can't find the \"doze' mode.   Things that I would want to work but is very unlikely: 1:) Make it compatible with the native camera app.",

I came across some bugs though: 1. when I choose to mute the shutter sound, it still makes the sound.  2. Once I take a picture I have to close the app on the watch right away, otherwise it keeps taking one picture after another every 2 seconds.  If you could resolve those issues I would be ever so grateful ^~^ love your work so far!",

One thing I would suggest for the developer is to allow the photos to be stored on an external memory card. Right now there are only Internal choices. I just noticed that the photos showed up on my G Watch R right side up... but were saved rotated to the left 90 degrees on my phone! What's up with that? Fix the rotation problem and allow photos to be stored on external memory and I'll change my rating to 5 stars. Especially for an app that has to be paid for!",

Unfortunately there are a few properties on here that aren't on domain which absolutely wipes the floor with this app. They recently contacted me to retest the app. It's slightly better but still clunky and unusable.",

Happy to report that I have been using the app for some years now and they are keeping up with technology. It works as advertised and in QLD anyway is almost essential to use if looking for listed property. As an investor, it would be nice to have the ability to have a simple text list (even export it)  instead of trawling past glossy photos and adverts,  but as the agents pay for development  I suppose they need their spot in the sun and the average buyer nowadays like the glam so they can buy on emotions.",

Only shows properties around your current location or a selected suburb, unlike in domain where I use the map feature to browse properties across all suburbs. Also adding calendar entries via the app does not link back to the selected property to review before you are about to leave on inspection. And no notifications at all!

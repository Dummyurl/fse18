        "comment": "Beautiful high resolution watch face. Minimalist yet stylish and very classy and above all, very battery efficient. This is what other watch faces should aspire to. Definitely worth it and looking forward to similar and more from Liongate and watchmaster.  Also for those complaining about the way \"four\" is depicted as \"IIII\",  go and google \"Watch maker's four\", that should give you the answer.",

        "comment": "The only thing holding me back from giving Pavilion a glowing review is for two reasons. One, the number four is supposed to be \"IV\"; but the prominent reason is because of the settings. The settings for the Pathfinder watch face allows you to keep the 'night mode' as the main watch face. If you include this change in the next update I'd be delighted, thank you.",

Turns out it was just something I needed to do on my end.    I think the face has a lot of potential.  It's good looking and functional.  I look forward to seeing if any additional features or customization are added, but it is very good for a new face.  Having used BCN for a long time now, and knowing how great of an app it is, I definitely recommend the face!",

Recently got an Android smart watch (call me late to the party if you like) and thought \"It would be great if I could use Time Recorder on here.\" Well, after a brief search of the play store there it is! Have to agree with a previous review that a vibrate on punching would be a very nice touch though. Perhaps in a future update? Keep up the great work!",

If it hit punch it doesn't give me any indication that it is running, nor does it give me indication that I am checking in or out. When you try to run the app (start tr) it doesn't come up automatically (you have to swipe through your notifications to find it). For something that is supposed to be convenient, it's kinda annoying. I think I'll stick to the stock stopwatch app for now.",

No notifications appear on the device when I check in/out using the phone app, even though I've verified that it is enabled and that Android Wear is not blocking this app's notifications. \"Start punch\" punches me in, but there's no apparent way to select the task, which makes it fairly useless for me.",

One feature request: Could you add a full page number keypad as one of the custom screens? I would love to be able to flick to a custom page on y watch that has all 10 numbers and a select button.",

Yes you will need a phone or a tablet with a built-in IR transmitter in order to use the app. An IR transmitter on the watch is not required. In addition, we will soon add an extra option to send the IR signals through the IR port of the watch instead of the phone (depending on the watch). Best Wishes!",

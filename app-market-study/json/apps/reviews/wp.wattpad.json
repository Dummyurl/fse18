If i log out it deletes the story completely. I thought it might be my phone but I've tried it on my tablet and on the website as well but nothing is working. Please fix it.",

Don't add any more stuff and mumbo jumbo to it. We need a good writing/reading app that will tend to our needs. I've been using this app since I was in High school and I really like it. But things like this makes me have trust issues. We (the writers), take time and energy to write those parts, not for them to be deleted. Please, please. Hear us out.",

I downgraded the app and it fixed the issue.howver, whastapp won't allow me to continue to using it, which, forced me to update and kill my battery once again.  I send bug reports, tried cancelling permissions but nothing worked. You should kick out your bad QA team and CS.",

While adding anyone to the group, an approval should be given by the person who is being added to the group. Sometimes without your consent you are added to the irrelevant groups. It should be invitation based only.   2. In a group, Group administrator should have the right to control Images, Audio, Video messages for better conversation. people send unnecessary images to important groups.   3. There should be two type of administrator-Super Administrator and Normal administrator. One who can only invite new members. Another who can control media and other settings.",

Also if anyone doesn't want to update it to the latest version then you shouldn't force them by showing \"update you messenger\" again and again. The one who would like to update, then he will.

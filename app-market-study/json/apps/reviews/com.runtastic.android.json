But other than that, it tracks your progress well, GPS feature is great, the voice commands are helpful and easy to adjust to your liking, and the stories to run to are awesome. My favorite features are the goals and the live tracking. My goal is to run 450 miles this year and with each run it tells me how close I am to achieving it. And the live tracking through Facebook allows people to watch your progress. It may sound bad to some introverts, but when people \"like\" the post on facebook while you're running, it comes over your headphones in real time as a cheer. So people actively cheer you on while you're running! It helps to motivate me. If I'm slowing down and someone cheers me on, I get a burst of energy and speed up. It pushes me to go harder and I love it. All in all an incredible app!",

        "comment": "Runtastic is the only long-distance training program I have found that does not include a strength training component. While my Runtastic purchase includes access to Runtastic Results - which is full  of great strength training exercises and plans - there is zero integration between the strength plans and the running plans in the two apps!   I tried doing a half marathon training plan in Runtastic in parallel with a 3 workouts per week (the minimum number of workouts possible) in Runtastic Results. To stay current on each plan I need to work out almost every day. After 21 straight days of running or strength exercises without a rest day, I finally hit the wall.  While the individual apps are excellent, I am very disappointed that there is not better integration between the training plans. Even the Runtastic blog goes on-and-on about how important it is to include strength training in your running plan! This disappointment is amplified by the fact that both Nike Run Club, and Garmin Connect have free and excellent integration between the running and strength apps! Why did I waste my money on this app when I could have had a more integrated training app for free?",

Tough luck if you want Sunday off and run on Monday: you can't!  Live coaching is not very useful and not customisable in any meaningful way.  Runtastic is insecure; doesn't sync with other running apps, so you're locked in by default.  The coloured zones have nothing to do with your actual pace or heart rates, so do with them what you want.  Many of us have been sold to Runtastic by Adidas when they retired micoach but this app is very inferior in many ways, and even annoying at times.",

When you're finished running you can look at the app see each Pace mile. Great working app and I do suggest the premium. Its worth it. I use this app during my first half marathon Race.",

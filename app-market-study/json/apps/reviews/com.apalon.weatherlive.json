I like the look and functionality but unfortunately the accuracy is not great. Often shows to expect rain on rainless days. Temperature and and cloud cover reasonably accurate. If forecast was consistently accurate I would give 5 stars. I'm using the paid version. Thank you.",

I hate how a ton of newer weather apps lock the radar and radar animation behind a paywall. This app does not. The only thing that is lacking for me is the detailed forecast. Alot of info is on screen. That's great but a text overview would be great too. That is the only thing keeping my rating low. If it is there, I can't find it. Animated backgrounds for different weather effects would be amazing.",

For some reason the app also regularly deletes my saved cities preferences, so I often have to re-add them (and this is an issue that has been happening for at least a year; I emailed with the developer about it and they didn't seem to understand what I was talking about and weren't able to recreate the issue - but it continues to happen.

I have no battery or security apps running that would interfere with the weather app and have also set weather live not to be optimised in my battery setting to try and fix.... When the live wallpaper does crash it always shows a static background of the cloudy daytime weather no matter what time of day or actual weather. EDIT... Changing the update rate to every 3 hours seems to of solved the problem. Thanks.",

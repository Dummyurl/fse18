However there is a tendency to warn about \"traffic light cameras\" mid motorway, which is odd - I realize that the db isn't created by the developer but I can't work out which category I need to turn off to stop getting 60% false alarms! Any help appreciated. One other niggle is that the sound is (always?) routed through the phone's speaker - I'd like the choice of using the headphone jack.",

I am currently trying to figure out this issue. \n\nAbout the headphones issue: the audio is routed through the same channels that the music apps use, so there should not be any problem with that. Will check anyway! :)\n\nThank you for your comment!",

For example in Wroxham Norfolk states there are traffic light signal cameras.  There aren't.  Gives location wrong then pops up again & keeps changing distance before clearing alert just before the real traffic lights. Rubbish. Will pursue for refund.",

Most are simply a screen shot of the phone widget. What good is this app if mostly just gives a picture of a widget.  For example the gmail widget scrolls in the wearable widget phone app, but not workable on the watch. On the watch I just see a picture of what is a widget, not workable.  Another example the callendar doesn't update. The weekly calendar scrolls on the phone WW app, but not the watch. Just a picture of the app on the watch.  Now the widget on the watch is just blank black screen. No phone widget. I still say it is useless.",

One glitch (hence 4 stars) is that when having multiple 'Wearable Widgets', they often revert to the same app / widget (e.g. 2x Gmail widgets), therefore I have to touch below one of the duplicate widgets and scroll (once again) to the correct app / widget (e.g National Rail). Hopefully this can be fixed.",

Watch is connected to the the phone but the app can't find the phone and keeps asking \"phone nearby?\"  Or \"failed to send tap\". Additionally, the widgets take too long to load.   I am sure the Wink widget is also problematic but the watch app seems quite flaky. On the plus side, any non-interactive widgets work just fine though they still take a while to show up. I would ask for my money back but am hopeful the developer will continue to work on this and improve the current poor experience on my Gear S3.",

Nothing like what is shown on their website or store  description where widgets work with your watch face. Great if you don't actually want to use your watch as a watch. I was expecting an app like every other AW app. Swipe left open app, use widget, swipe again and close app. No it takes over the entire screen and the only way to get out is to go into watch setting and change the watch face back to an actual watch. Need to open it ? Go back to your list of app and scroll down to W open it, use widget, then go back into settings and change watch face back to your favorite watch.  Maybe there are options to make it actually functional in the paid version, but I am not going to pay before I can play .    RE:  You don't know what I was expecting ? I was expecting a widget like what is pictured in your description that works along with a watch face. Adds a button or 2 to the watch face.  Not an app that just takes over the entire watch face.",

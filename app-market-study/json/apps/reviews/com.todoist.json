Only issue is occasionally the app does not sync properly with the website & chrome plugin, which can cause some tasks (usually those inputted directly into the app) to be overlooked without intentionally looking at the app. Other than that, it would get the full 5\u2b50",

They are so intuitive you can almost just guess them! Only thing missing is a full adapted app to the samsung gear watch. It shows the tasks through notifications but only wjen they are due and you dont have a lot of options on it.",

Todoist is extremely simple to use, very user friendly, but nevertheless it has a wide range of possibilities and really helps you get things done. I love how easy it is to create repetitive tasks. It is multi-platforms, synchronisation between devices is automatic and instantaneous. The support section is very helpful and there's a lot of instruction videos on YouTube. I suscribed for the paid version, it's worth the price for me, but you can get very well along with the free version.",

Even though I have only few reminders, it keeps giving me an error that I can't have more than 700 reminders. I definitely don't have 700 reminders, it's not even close. My total number of tasks are little more than 100 only. It's been couple weeks since I have contacted them with this issue and they don't have a solution for me yet. I get an email from them every 3-5 days asking for some information and then I here back from them after few days. It's too bad as I like everything else about this app. If they can't fix it for me in time, I will try another app for my needs.  Update: Still no fix after weeks of wait. I am moving on to different todo app \"ticktick\" now.",

Something that could take this to the next level as a productivity tool is the ability to add a \"Done list\" feature that tallies the completion of repeating tasks so that you can chart and work on habits or see how your cumulative training in one aspect is going across a calendar or by minutes/hours spent.",

Nothing beats white on black for easy on the eyes and since I'm literally in my task list ALL DAY LONG, the absence of that display feature is a deal breaker. I currently use a very simplistic app with a \"night mode\" that coverts the display from black on white to white on black. That free app also integrates with Google Tasks for seamless portability across all of my devices. How is it that this vendor decides that integration is a PREMIUM feature? I certainly not PAYING just to discover that I don't like how it integrates with Google!  Uninstalling the app after I submit this review.",

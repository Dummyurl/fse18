If you try sending a vibration immediately after opening the app the button lags behind by a lot. Also wish you could change it from a foreground service to a background one. All in all, worth the download but hardly complete.",

I really hope you can make it so that you can see the taps and and send emoji and your heart beat as well right from your watch to all of your contacts and not just one receiver code. :) EDIT: maybe you could add the feature to only vibrate the watch. When I tried it with my own code, it vibrated the phone too.",

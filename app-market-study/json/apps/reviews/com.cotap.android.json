The problem is that for some reason, the app will just decide to stop notifying me when I am messaged, which really hinders my ability to be the leader my organization needs me to be.   I reached out to customer support and at first they seemed very helpful and involved, but they could not find a solution and promised me they would reach back out to me, but they never did. I understand that the notification problem might be my phone causing issues, but as somebody who is specialized in marketing/customer service, I find this customer service unacceptable. If customer service were to show greater effort, I would much more likely to give a higher rating, but poor customer service is a big problem with an app.",

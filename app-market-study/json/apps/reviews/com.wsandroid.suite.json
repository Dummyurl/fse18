Had to use another app. for firewall which allows  me to pick which continents I can block. This would be a great feature to be added to McAfee Mobile. Also noticed you can restore  contacts but nothing else. Instead of paying for Mobile it would also be great to combine with the  PC Total Protection. Love my McAfee products!",

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much security for the price I paid for the McAfee 10, which was at as a Prime Deal on Amazon & even though I had used McAfee before at a much smaller level, it wasn't anything special, if you know what I mean. Man, was & have I been totally shocked. McAfee is unbelievable how it protects our family. Excellent purchase on my part!!",

I still feel safe and secure whilst using the app. I have now been using the app for 6 and a half months. When using the internet on my phone I would prefer it if the apps web protection would highlight either the good or bad websites so I would know instead of guessing which ones are safe. The app has had a revamp and it looks good and performs well, keep up the good work techies.",

Review is still just as good, feel much safer having it on my phones. Used it to locate a stolen phone update: worth every penny. Thank you for an amazing product and ease of use. Saved me 800 bucks and let me catch some worthless scum. Update on 9-27-17. Review is not even enough to say how much i like the product , and I've added a smart watch since and it's been great. 12-15-17: update review. App update ruined it. I no longer can do many of the options I loved. Cannot locate devices anymore. Gives me a login screen where the map should be. Even when I login, it gives some cookies error. I can verify I let cookies be set and yet locate service still will not work. I loved this app for years until this week. Fix app and I'll review again. So so sad they ruined the app for us paying customers. Pay my fees every year . If they don't fix app I'll cancel and find another provider next week. 2-11-18. Bugs seem to be fixed, back to 5 star review",

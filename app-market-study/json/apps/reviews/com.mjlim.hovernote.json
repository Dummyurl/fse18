I can easily assign an always showing shortcut on the screen to open this app, if you are on the keyboard I can  use the pause function on the keyboard for a video lecture whilst simulatenously typing on the notepad. You can also open multiple notes, use keyboard shortcuts, automatically save. The only thing I want added is universal cloud access to the notes on multiple systems like google keep. This app is closely similar to one other app I know of, but this one has better features. Thank you so much developer, I'm going to check out your apps, if there are any. This is helping me with my lecture viewing alot. Thank you.",

Can paste all or a portion of the info copied.  Hovernote can be enlarged to cover the whole screen, or it can revert to a small icon with one tap.  You can have multiple Hovernotes floating on the screen at once, and you can drag them to wherever you want them.  When you change to a different app, the Hovernotes are still hovering and can easily be pasted.  Not sure if a name of a note can be made to appear on the note icon.",

The docked symbol is unobtrusive.  This one also has many useful options in the settings.   Cons  The top border is rather thick, it would be useful to have a toggle  button to trigger minimal borders which would also hide the toolbar.",

Add contact images for favorites. and sort it in any sensible order. Right now it appears totally random. Add easy navigation option for contact list. I have to scroll to the whole list to get to anyone at the bottom",

Full phone book need a search function. 3. Round keyboard wont work well because touching the edge of every watch is crazy. A rectangle keyboard will be more easier to type.",

Im using a moto 360 paired with galaxy note edge.  PROS: make calls, recent list, contacts list, opens immediately after answering call, better then having nothing. CONS: You must make/answer calls from the watch or the app doesn't open, once phone call is answered the only button that works is end call. Fix for 5 star rating",

I have an LG Urbane watch and in comparison to the crappy LG phone app available this is so much better, worth the purchase!  The only additional improvements are firstly the ability to use the watch mic to speak which I know has been mentioned before in other reviews. Secondly, I don't know if i'm asking too much here but since my watch has wifi capability, the ability to connect my headset to the watch directly instead of the phone in case my phone is not in bluetooth range would be the ultimate! Since i can connect my watch to the phone via wifi then could this be possible!? If either of the above two suggestions could be incorporated then definitely 5* plus!",

While it's awesome it enables speakphone on your phone, I think it would be cool if it enabled your watch microphone simultaneously. So you didn't have to worry about speaking to your phone.

With a bluetooth headset paired to the phone, no need to get your phone out at all to make or receive calls, it can all be done from the watch. I would personally welcome a traditional dialler layout, and for favourite contacts to be listed alphabetically. But these are personal preferences. The app works great.",

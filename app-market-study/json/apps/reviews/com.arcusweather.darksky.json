It does work and you will know when you need to take your umbrella.",

It has become my weather app of choice.  What is especially nice is that a gives you an accurate forecast summary for the upcoming week so you can just simply read the forecast. The map is nice but I would like to be able to view cloud cover too.  Sometimes the auto updating does not work.",

However, the hourly forecast 2 hrs out said \"drizzle\", when it actually turned out to be a severe thunderstorm with 70+ mph gusting winds. That is not ok. It's a serious safety concern for a person using this app as their sole weather source. Anyone with even passing knowledge of how to read a radar would've seen that 2 hr forecast to be grossly inaccurate, while somebody with experience reading radars could've known that to be inaccurate at least 8 hrs out. I have the paid version that allows for updating the widget on the home screen, which is convenient so long as it's a reliable report. I'm not sure I can justify using this app anymore.",

The pictures make all the difference so that instead of seeing \"Milk\" on the list, you can see exactly what milk to get. The new round photos though are a problem. Most of my stuff comes in square boxes rather than round ones (except a few cheeses) and I get messed in the store up trying to find the round box of Cheerios. ;)   Sync between devices is perfect (and automatic) so I'll give it the sixth star.",

Suggestion While I can save purchases in history it would be helpful if I could save pending lists for different shops as we all shop at various outlets. This would enable us to recall and load up the current list we need to use. Thanks again",

It sorts the items into catagories too so they will be together in the store.I thought the pictures would be unnecessary but they are actually very helpful when scanning down a list quickly in a crowded store. You can photograph a particular item in the shop and then use that pic to remind you which one to get",

Set up a regular list and just copy onto your weekly list . Searching is easy with both voice and written.  Prices can be changed when shopping straight from your current list. Many great features make this an excellent app",

Thank you, thank you, thank you. I've been waiting for this for a while. Not sure why it said \"Evaluation period: 30 days remaining\" at the bottom. I hope you won't be charging for this feature. That would definitely change my rating.",

I spent some time trawling through other grocery shopping apps which claimed to be simple but were not. I just want a weekly easy to compile list with ability to save items with prices, check em off when in my trolley and be able to look at my shopping history and control my food budget BEFORE I get in the car. This app is perfect please do not do any updates which will ruin it!",

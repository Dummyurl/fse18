If you're looking for a shopping list that allows you to have a different list for every store you go to, while adding (and removing) an item to/from every store's list, having the ability to sort your list by (custom) aisles, then this should be your pick. Of course it takes some time to set up (adding all possible stores to an item, and adding a different aisle for each store). When you set up a list of aisles for each store, each aisle preceded by a 'sorting' number, according to the order in which they are present in the store, shopping can be very fast.",

Takes a little upfront work to identify which aisles products are in but, once done, the store visit can be arranged by aisle, so it's a quick matter of going only to the necessary aisles and its done. Even if we're both there shopping, we just knock off each item as we get it and the sync let's the other know it's done. So damn handy. EXACTLY what I was looking for!",

You can update and change things on the fly from a number of screens very easily ( price, store, move items on and off lists, and more so easily).  You can customize the sort order, aisle info, packaging, description, etc.  Once an item is listed, making a store list quickly is a breeze!     Really well designed app!  I might offer suggestions to make it work even better, but I fear it may hurt what works really well now - if it ain't broke . . .",

I can make up my own aisle system with only the items I shop for, it's totally personalized, no cluttering by things I don't shop for. Also, my phone died but the data seemed to have been backed up by Google. I didn't lose anything - big plus.",

They are not close to matching your app!  March 2017 update:  once I figure out how to set up and use, it's been great! Very useful.  Is there an iPhone version?   Thanks to this app has the ability to take pictures for the item needed and additional notes, I am final free of the 17 yrs of taking my children to stores with me because there is no way they can complain I forgot something or I bought the wrong item.",

I'm slightly puzzled as to how some people say they prefer Google maps as for me they're like light and dark. For cycling this is way better. I just wish it had the ability to finish route with walking so I could, if necessary, lock up my bike and finish the journey on foot. Other than that it is perfect.",

        "comment": "Really terrible navigation compared to Google maps. I bought the road bike and turn by turn navigation because Google maps doesn't really do cycling routes in Italy. From Sorrento to Vesuvius it took me the most horrible possible route - for over a mile it wasn't even a road, I had to get off and carry my bike down loads of steps - and even on roads it would constantly tell me to make a turn but then say \"you have left the route \" when I took the correct turn. It meant that I had to constantly stop to double check the route on my phone, as I couldn't trust the instructions. Also a lot sorer on battery than it probably should be, meaning that I ran out of battery midway through a journey that I hadn't expected to.",

Turn-by-turn voice navigation works like a charm (at the beginning it was horrible, but after several updates it got really sophisticated), you don't need to look at the screen. Routes are also automatically recalculated if you take the wrong street. One suggestion for following update would be that you can change the language of the voice navigation (currently it uses system language oer default).",

I had also problems with logging in. Interface is rather poor: how does one stop recording the ride? How one can upload rides from another app for the European cycle challenge. This app put me off partaking in the challenge in the end. I wonder how much money EU has wasted on it?",

On the second it shows that during my ride I've challenged the elevation of almost 200m and reached the top speed of 57km/h - both measures are totally not true. UX is horrible, user has no confirmation of any action. List of trips is super unfriendly. I can't find option to delete the recorded trip of 0km. Finding ECC2017 contest through the menu is a complete missunderstanding. Rankings have no charts and they are very pure. Navigation is very bad - suggesting me to jump off in the middle of a bridge, etc. I only wonder how this horrible app made to be the official one for ECC2017 ...",

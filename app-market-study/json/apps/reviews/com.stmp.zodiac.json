Endless customisation options mean you can dress up your watch to match anything you're wearing and its almost impossible to find a bad combo (I use it on both my black and silver 360's). All information you could want is available to display and the face is as flashy or as minimal as you like. Easy enough on battery too. GEDDIT!",

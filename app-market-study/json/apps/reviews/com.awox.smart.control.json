        "comment": "Hey there! I had the same issues as most of the users here, while trying to establish a connection with my Fueva 1 lamp for the first time. The app always got stuck at the last step of the connection wizard, with the litlle green circle spinning until the end of times. However, in one of the many attempts after restarting the app, I tried to leave everything as default in the wizard setup and it worked like a charm. With that, I mean that I didn't change either the picture nor the name of the lamp, just hit \"next\" until it was over and it worked fine. I had another lamp installed in another room, so I tried this method again and it also worked, first try. So there you go, looks like an annoying bug but at least seems to have an easy solution. Later I could change the names and picture of both lamps without any problem or issues with the connection. Hope this helped someone!",

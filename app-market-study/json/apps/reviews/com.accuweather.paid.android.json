The Accuweather team don't just appear to give their forecast out in a randomly condensed fashion, as I have felt most of the other weather station's do.  Instead, they have always been more concerned about giving out reliable & accurate forecasts!",

However it would get 5*s from me if you added an auto location option. It would also be nice if it was more accurate. I just got a wind advisory alert and its as calm as the air in a deep underground cave with no ventilation.",

Nice features like Real Feel. Widgets are nice too. Minor remark here - check text frame about \"Time of Update\". On a full 1080 normal HD on a 5,2 Moto G5, for me, it feels a bit in the way or a bit misaligned perhaps? I would either drop it, move it to a full width horizontal frame at bottom or top, or make it smaller or use shorter description... Along those lines. Talking about biggest widget. Thanks for a very good app and Keep updating and extending the reach and access to measuring stations for Europe.",

I have loved previous versions, but the current one pales in comparison to Dark Sky and even Yahoo's app. The latest disappointment is that Weather Alerts do not display any text. Dark Sky shows the National Weather Service bulletin, but AccuWeather tells me nothing.",

With both the Premium and a free versions of weather running, the battery use can be a problem. Turn off one of the two weather applications as desired.",

I still favor the first version of your weather app. I'll give it 5 stars if you make the old app available. Other than that you have a pretty decent app but is really designed for smart watches which I don't have. Buy me a smart watch and I'll give it 4 stars.",

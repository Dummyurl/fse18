It took me 20 min to place an order for one pizza.  Rather than spending so much in your marketing ( getting emails everyday) ,spend some on better server infrastructure",

However, it would be nice, if you make a mistake with the ordering store or delivery/pick up time, if the app allowed you to change those details mid order rather than having to cancel the order and start all over again. Being able to access store specific vouchers within app would be great too. Also, why present me with the option of paying $3 to guarantee 20 minute delivery then not actually make it selectable? Annoying...",

Can start filming or record audio purely on watch. Don't even need to wake the screen (M2 and Z3 (L and MM)). Filming quality is perfect.Use this with a Z3 and SW3 and the feedback quality to watch is customisable, so can cater to every environment. Photo taking is superior to even Sony camera bridge app. No ads, no spam, no privacy issues. This is pure genious. 10 stars.  Can you pretty please update app to support Oreo. Can film from watch and take photos (Wear 1.5 watch), but app on phone crashes. Also, donate link please. You deserve it!",

Not sure why but it's very disappointing and I will be looking forward to seeing the actual artists image portrayed with the song. SN: totally agree with RioVentura. I miss having the blue button there. The convienence of having the button there to tap was nice.",

        "comment": "I used to use shazam years ago and it was perfect. It could find a song over noise and even when the song was low volume. It didn't take too long to get a recording and have the song you want to know. But now it doesn't seem to work. It only recognises the most popular songs and even then you have to try a few times. But what's the point of it if everyone and their grandma already know the only songs this app seems to recognise?  I wanted this app to be able to recognise the songs I don't know on the radio and on TV shows but most times it won't work or by the time it would, the song would be over and gone. This is incredibly sad as I know for a fact that shazam used to be so much better than this. Please fix this",

U got to improve it, it is must to find it in radio so that I trace music directly from my phone's radio \ud83d\udcfb thru \ud83c\udfa7. It shouldn't be limited a speaker \ud83d\udd0a of radio and TV but it must thru headphones too just like the track id of Sony did. Thanks and I hope that u will improve just like I requested \ud83d\ude09",

Now you basically need to hold it up to the speakers and tell everyone within a 100m radius to \"shut up\" - and even then you'll probably get 3x \"no result\". How the mighty has fallen.....",

        "comment": "I switched back to Shazam because Google Assistant requires you use Google Music in order for it to work. And since Google can't seem to stop doing things that force users into their own inferior services instead of leaving things that work alone because they previously used mature open source solutions, the only reasonable approach to finding a permanent solution is to stop using google apps and deprive them of revenue until such time that they reverse policies. Spotify, Pandora and iTunes are all vastly superior services and Shazam is superior to GA for not using the Google Music platform.",

        "comment": "This update breaks the lyrics functionality of Shazam in some pretty horrible ways. In the previous version, if there were no lyrics available in Shazam you used to be able to click on it to find lyrics on the web. That functionality is gone. Now, if there are no lyrics within Shazam, there is no lyrics button, period. Also when you press the (very small, difficult to use while driving) lyrics button at the top of the page, it brings up the current line of the lyrics--but it's static, it does not advance--you have to click it again in order to see the rest of the lyrics. This is an unnecessary and redundant click and annoying. Finally, the default action of the lyrics is to enlarge and highlight the current line. This is very annoying if that's not what you want, sometimes I want to read ahead in the lyrics or scroll through the lyrics without constantly having Shazam take control back away from me and highlighting the current line.  All in all, the old lyrics system was much better, and finding lyrics so I can understand the song I'm hearing on the radio is the only reason I use Shazam. So this update is really annoying and a giant step backward as far as I'm concerned.",

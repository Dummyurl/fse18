        "comment": "I've been wondering why anyone would download a analog watch face to a smart watch, this is a good alternative, still showing the seconds (which is the triangle increasing in size) with digital numbers, the text of which is big enough to glance at. I only wish there was an option to add the date. Cool design though, feels very modern while still holding on to elements of a classic watch face so it doesn't scream smart watch. I really like the color combinations as well.",

Also one major problem with this watch face is the time isn't synced properly. Every other item says the correct time but this watch face. Always two mins behind. I change watch face and it catches up. Can that be fixed?",

We want to make Bermuda beautiful AND functional so it is important to eliminate issues like these. The problem occurs when the clock tries to animate while in the 'dimmed' mode. The latest update should fix this for you! Any more problems - don't hesitate to get in touch",

One nice touch is the way the numbers slide out of each-others way as they approach so you can always read the time with the 'hour' to the left of the 'minute'",

But you're right - we could avoid blocks of colour. Re motion: We experimented with a number of 'tick' movements and found a compromise of a \"smooth tick\" felt best as it helped keep the feeling of a traditional timepiece",

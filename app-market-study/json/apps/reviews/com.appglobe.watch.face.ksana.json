Thought this was a watch or wear 2.0 issue and factory reset the watch and removed all wear apps from my phone and started again. Seemed to be ok for the first few hours then bluetooth disconnected again and again. Tried deleting different apps from my watch. Then as a last ditch attempt thought id uninstall this app. Worked a treat after that, even tried reinstalling ksana again and low a behold started disconnecting bluetooth randomly. So I deleted Ksana again and been fine for days no bluetooth issues for days now. Like I say loved this app but the bluetooth dropping really got on my nerves.",

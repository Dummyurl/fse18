        "comment": "I put in an order and got a confirmation.  The order was using beta testing credit and then I payed the balance with my credit card.  When I went to pick up my order, the restaurant said I hadn't paid.  They had received a fax from BeyondMenu saying I had to pay at the restaurant (even though my order was placed through LevelUp and I have never had an account with BeyondMenu).          I called LevelUp support, and they could not resolve the issue to my satisfaction as they wanted to send an email to the restaurant confirming that I had paid, but the restaurant only accepts faxes.  The restaurant also said they didn't have any account with LevelUp and hadn't heard if it, and that my order displayed as from BeyondMenu not LevelUp.  It seems like there are still a lot of glitches to work out, and I am not sure what the relationship between LevelUp and BeyondMenu is.           Note: The customer service lady who answered the phone at LevelUp was very nice, polite, and professional.  It didn't seem like the company gave her much authority to actually resolve the issues though.       Overall, it seems like the benefit is that you can have your order ready and paid for in advance so you can just grab-and-go.  However, it ended up taking me longer than if I'd ordered without the app due to the afoeentioned issues, and was also a very awkward sitaution.          This experience was part of the beta testing, so I understand that the app hasn't been perfected yet.   I think it has potential, but that I would wait to see that the issues have been resolved before trying it again.",

Other than that, I've got no use for this app. I'd even be happy to pre pay since I know about what I spend every month, but that's also not an option.",

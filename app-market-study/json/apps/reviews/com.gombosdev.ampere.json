When using, the device would discharge faster than the charger could recharge. Turns out it was the cheap usb charging cable that i bought of amazon. Swapped to a different cable and the charge current tripled. I would never have found that without this app.",

In addition to all the charging methods it was previously able to detect, it now also detects Motorola Turbo charging. The only thing I could possibly want that this app does not have is to be able to determine charge rates of Moto Mods but that may be we'll be inside.  *I would like it to detect when it's charging up in Moto mod in the \"Charge Rate\" section but I realize that's a lot too ask as the target audience would be comparatively small.  Thank you for a great app. Job well done. Very well done.",

If you need to know the details of what's going on with the interplay of your battery, chargers, and phone, then this is the tool to use. There's always room to improve, logs for better diagnostics would help, but I love it as is.",

For example, as your battery ages, current will increase, being relatively higher for a moderate load, as compared to a new battery. This is actually a function of the voltage drop resulting from increasing internal resistance of the battery.",

Unfortunately at the moment the app has become unusable for me.  t's a good app. I'm not sure how accurate the amp readings are but this will depend on your device. On my LG G3 for instance I suspect Ampere is deriving it's measurements from /sys/class/power_supply/battery/current_now, some of the readings from that file occasionally show my phone charging at up to 30A! Also the app was recently showing my phone allegedly charging at 2.5A on a 2A charger which is obviously unlikely to be accurate. But these are sensor or kernel issues, not really the app's fault and the readings I get from the app are good enough to tell if a charger/cable is significantly faster/slower than another one.",

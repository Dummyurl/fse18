I will be sure to remove any app that puts an ad on android wear, There is no screen real-estate, time, attention, or battery life for this.  Also the demo is broken completely on Moto360.",

The point of Android Wear is to get notified of something important, do something, and be done.  Or to prompt the watch with a request for an app or voice search.  None of these things involve an ad breaking the flow.  Just like Google banned apps with notification ads, I will not be surprised when Google bans apps with wearable ads.",

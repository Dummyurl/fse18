Love the font and how the stop play button turns black when listening to Google Music. Rated 4 stars. Features i'd like to see: Ability to set 24h or 12h AM/PM format, display the date, Toggle ambient mode to color or black or white. This would make it perfect. Would rate 5 stars or even pay for this. Way better than most paid watchfaces. The Japanese know how its done.",

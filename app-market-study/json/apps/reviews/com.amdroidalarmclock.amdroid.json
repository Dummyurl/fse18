With the math problems and the notification thing that checks if you're actually awake, however, I only need one alarm, because that will make sure I'm actually consious for more than a minute. I'm very much loving this app. Thank you!",

Dev, please make the nightstand clock activate with 1 tap. Also allow for font size/color/etc. customization, show the next alarm time, sliding dimmer would be cool, maybe weather underneath the time, autostart when charger is connected. These features would make this alarm app best in plastered by a mile. Thanks.",

Great extra feature and if aomeone finds a better one please inform me as i will not be lookingfor another while this one still works.",

Theres no chance of not waking up... it fits my life perfect, ive regained control back.i really cant fault it one bit... does what it says... im even feeling more proactive as im not over sleeping anymore..

It's an unpleasant experience to be so frustrated with an app just as I'm waking up.

If you don't like the defaults then go to settings and there are lots of customization settings there. I would give it 5 stars except for the default settings. But I would suggest that more options be added for reminder interval. ... For example \"remind every 3rd Sat of the month\".",

Perfect for when you aren't actually attached to your phone in real life.  Edit: I'm going to stop using this app because when the notification is dismissed, I am taken to BZ Reminder's screen and away from what I was busy doing, which interrupts my work flow. Does the paid version do that?",

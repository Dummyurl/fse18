This gives incredible times for the distance you walk. If you have a bad walk with a lot of pain the time you took according to the programme can be faster than when you had a good day with minimal pain and walked very fast. This is unacceptable. You want to know your genuine time for the walk with no automatic pauses and restarts deducted from your total time.",

I have been to the help page and done everything it tells me to on there. I have also restarted my phone and it is still not working. I know it is not my phone because the person I walk with is having exactly the same problem. I notice when you put it into google search a lot of other people are having the same trouble. Unless Map My Walk get this sorted then I will be looking for a more reliable app.",

The recent update however does not sync well within the Android OS on the S7, requiring the battery/sleep settings to be reset before every use in order to allow the app to work with the phone's GPS.  Despite saving settings repeatedly, the two default back to a state that prevents GPS tracking within the app.  An app that requires changes to the battery settings before every use is not convenient enough to use.",

I also can't switch from back to front without closing and reopening the watch app. I would have rated this lower but it is the only app like it so it is fine. It is definitely worth it. Devs: please fix the picture taking problem!",

Let's see how long will it work as the other reviewers said it stop working after a few days. For now I am giving this 4 stars, it is a great and useful app when it is working. 5 stars for developer's support.    I managed to get a refund, but then I decided to give it a chance so I re  purchased, re installed, clear the cache, re started my One M9, re started the watch, re sync, all the  possible re! So please refund me, I gave it a chance, I wasted a lot of time trying to make it it work. Please give my money back. Thanks",

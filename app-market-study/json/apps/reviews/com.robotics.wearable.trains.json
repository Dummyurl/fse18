Also nice to see material design on the phone part of app   it would be cool if I could rearrange the order of saved stations though  as I like having 'nearest' station but want to have it after my commute :)",

This is a great little app. Simple to use on both watch and on the phone and looks great too (love the way the train station names curve around the top of the watch on a round screen). As someone else has suggested, using an Wear mini launcher helps to access the app. Wish that 'London Bus Checker' can add their bus stop countdowns to the watch next...",

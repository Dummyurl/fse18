        "comment": "Ok the app for everything you say it is seems spot on! Great work! The only thing keeping it back from being perfect is 1. In app ads.... Literally i don't mind paying the 0.99-2.99 in app purchase for the ads to go away i just can't stand them... 2. If there is a way would like to see the current bluetooth devices connected to the phone 3. Would like to be able to disable and enable the wifi 4. Would also hope to see a way to select which wifi networks or bluetooth devices i connect to ? I know the last one is far fetched but will definitely give 5 stars if we can do something about the ads",

But it would be great if you could add support for dual sim phones so you can display both cell signals the phone pick is nice but you can use this realestate for the other signal info when sim 2 is on in settings   If you made an option for always on the screen indicators (like in the system tray or something) for cell signals and WiFi So you can see when you loose or gain signal at a glance i would pay for it!!!!!!!",

It is elegant and, since the last update, functions perfectly on my SW3 with my Galaxy Note 3. Have never known a developer to react so quickly to problems pointed out by users. Highly recommended.",

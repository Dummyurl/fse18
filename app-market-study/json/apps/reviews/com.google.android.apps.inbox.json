Please change it back so the reply box just expands like it used to rather than a whole new screen like I'm about forward the message, very annoying!",

This app was amazing I LOVED it but I recently went to send an email and literally all I can do is type and attach something.   I can't format any of my text and I can't even add links to my email.  If I wanted to just type and add a pic I would text message.   I am trying to send a professional email and I can't do it from my phone any more.   I checked and they did the same to the mobile version for my tablet as well.  I even logged into the regular gmail version to compose the email and the same thing!  This better just be a glitch that is fixed very VERY soon because this is just not acceptable.",

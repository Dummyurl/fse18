I do realize there has been complaints about it being to hard to play or not being \"smooth\" That is just my Moto 360 on how small it is. It does run smooth though. This app is a fun app, AQ. Please consider making more games for Android Wear",

So it seems the board is not scalled correctly for the 8x8 board. Double tap to zoom in mostly works. Cool this works on the watch but would rather play on my Note 3. ;-)",

Will update review if this can be fixed to play without switching my watchface.",

But I'm not sure if this app is causing android wear to crash or not. Been seeing that problem lately. And from time to time, I notice this app is up and running. A potential problem because it keeps the watch awake. Also when it does, it has a mostly filled in screen somehow. But I foo like it.",

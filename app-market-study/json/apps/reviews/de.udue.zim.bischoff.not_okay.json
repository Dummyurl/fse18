        "comment": "I have no idea how to judge this, or even to verify this isn't malicious.  \"OK Google\" on 5.1.1 still triggers but speaking ANYTHING after saying \"OK Google\" will not be picked up.  So I am a little worried this is not doing as it says. The fact the watch still responds to OK google leads me to believe this app could be listening., which no offense to the developer but I would rather google listen in then you. The whole purpose of installing this was to increase security by muting/disabling android wears mic, I never use voice activation and the thought of a watch that whenever the face is lit up is actively listening...i just dont like it.  Hopefully I can get some clarification, till then this is getting uninstalled for fear of security risk.  to be noted it only requires Mic permissions so technically it should be safe!",

I will not use any app that uses battery life while not in use. I am uninstalling this watch face until they can get the useless battery drain solved. I use more than one watch face that I change every so often. It's the one of the great things about this watch.",

My only complaint is that I have received on the order of a dozen notifications that the face can \"also utilize new widgets\", which are apparently limited to a weather display, and for which an additional fee is required. I have responded to the notification each time, but it continues to pop up, and will apparently not be satisfied with \"no thanks\". In fact the widget purchase screen has only one option - \"install\". This likely to be uninstalled.",

The trick is the widget is not free but you only find that out once you you click \"Install\" from the widget invite screen. I'm uninstalling the base app to not have to deal with this nagware anymore.",

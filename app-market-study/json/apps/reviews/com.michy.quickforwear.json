I have installed and uninstalled and still nothing and, on top of that you can't get your money back.. No 15 minute refund from Google. How can something so simple to install and setup not work as it's supposed to. All I want to do is reply with this keyboard and I can't.",

This isn't a negative review, I like the app. I've had it for over half a year and it's just now working, but at least it's working. LG watch urbane 2nd edition",

Then I will gladly change the rating to 5 stars.  Even so, I highly recommend this app if you have a wear device!",

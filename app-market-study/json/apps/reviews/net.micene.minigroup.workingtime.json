Random punch-ins and punch-outs appear in my event log. The app can be moved to the SD card, but doing so causes it to be uninstalled from the watch. I use this app every day to keep track of my hours; please fix these glitches, and I'll be happy.  I'm using it on a ZenWatch 2 with a Galaxy S5.",

Also the UI on both phone and watch are clean and simple. My only suggestion would be to add voice commands for Wear. I would love to be able to say \"OK Google, clock me in/out\" and have it do it!",

Any how if you want to get your feet wet in trading stock use this app. Start with 50 bucks and try to maximize your trade for profits. This app makes it easy to sell and buy stocks. Waiting for the free version of the website but until then will use Robinhood for sure.",

The flipside to the streamlined look is less information - I find myself switching to other accounts on other apps to get more information. Also, free trades are definitely a bonus.  It would be amazing to be able to categorize things in the watchlist. Stay strong on the streamlined UI approach, but also find a way to get some detailed information in there.",

So there is zero reason to not try the stock market.  As for the design of the app, it is very easy to navigate among both stocks you own and stocks you are interested in keeping an eye on.  I do think it lacks a little aesthetically.  It could easily incorporate better charts or grids as well as widgets. However, I feel bad saying anything negative at all about this app, it's free, it's life changing, and it's totally awesome.   If you want to get out of the \"hood\" start investing in your life, start using Robinhood!",

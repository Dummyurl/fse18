Now it's a heart for every hour, so will be easy to read, and for 3,6,9,12 it's a bigger heart.\nFor settings please open on your phone Android Wear and on Watch faces select Love (current watch face) and now you will see a settings icon over the preview of watch face. Click on that settings icon to go to settings.\nThanks.",

        "comment": "Amazingly customizable when compared to other galaxy watch faces. Works seamlessly without any awkward glitches in the galaxy movement (Huawei Watch). That being said, it would be nice if there were more time hand options (more minimalist like mirage?) That felt a little more premium and clean. Also, it would be nice if you could freeze the orientation of the rotating galaxy for an aerial view, side view, etc. Lastly, a cleaner, more contrast nebula with less foggy color would be nice. Giving five stars because hard working developer who I believe will keep updating with more features, better efficiency, and cleaner styles!",

I have chosen digital and the sleep mode puts the time higher than the notifications sit.    I might like a large font on the sleep mode time but it is easily legible and discrete which many people would prefer.  Unfortunately I have noticed that it consumes a lot of battery on my LG G Watch & about halves it's running time.",

Not only you guys give me the very accurate direction, you guys also help me to save budget on transport. This app is totally life changing! But one thing that I would like to ask is that how do I earn the points? I've been completing my journey for three times so far and I havent earn any points. Please answer.   Side note: I told my friends about Moovit and they are so satisfied when they used the app for the first time! Keep up the good work!   Best regards,  Dayah \ud83d\udc95",

Possible improvements would be the map search function as I struggle to find actual locations without an address readily available. Also the map orientation with my real time movement is slow.

I mean, In Buenos Aires, Argentina, I choose to go to Pilar, so in the app it just give you the option to go by train but on the website you have more options like going on a bus, and has more routes; so if you can updates the routes on the app, I will give you 5 stars, thank you.",

Great work!  EDIT: Great idea, hadnt thought of just disabling the notifications from the app. I use adb on the watch for development so I was constantly receiving the notification. Great app. Functions perfectly",

Works every time to notify me that the battery has charged to a level of my choosing (80% is my current choice although I'd prefer to use 70% if it was included in the settings). I will happily give this 5 stars if the developer adds this and also a setting to notify at a discharged level of my choosing. (20% or 30% would suit me). Great work so far though.",

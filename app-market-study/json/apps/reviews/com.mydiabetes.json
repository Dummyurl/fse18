Diabetes: M has an East to use interface and lets me track food, blood glucose, and medication all in the same log. Also the food database makes finding and entering accurate information easy. There are charts and graphs that present the data from your log in a meaningful formats so that you can better control your diabetes.",

I started-off only using it for basic functions such as logging my blood sugar. Now I've dived deeper into what it offers i find I'm taking the guess work out of how much glucose to take to treat a hypo or how much bolus is required to bring BG levels back down to target. Seriously considering subscribing to paid version. 5 stars guys!",

It would also be great if the app could access the food data from Google Fit, as you can use other apps to write data to it.  Also could you guys look into adding calories burned with exercise please. Including the calories burned from apps such as Google Fit  Then the app would get 5 stars.   PS I am a paying subscriber",

        "comment": "Update 2018: I have a subscription and I try to export the report, and the export crashes for any format. Really getting worse.   Initial 2016: I am trying to import a CSV file exported from my Accu-check mobile and keep getting a date format error, even thought it\u2019s the right format, the processing also includes time which is a different column.  Cannot see how I could import my old data, would have been good to try and use it.  @Rossen: Thanks for the response, but for a fact I know that there is at-least 1 other app on the Play Store and iOS which took the csv file and processed that data. And also I had a look, no where does it say in the csv file. If you need I can send you a copy of the CSV file.",

        "comment": "Easy to use. Starts out at a pace that's not too easy but not too hard especially for someone like me who can walk for long periods of time but never ran for more than a minute straight. I also like that it syncs with Myfitnesspal.  UPDATE: The app doesn't seem to have a constant connection to GPS so you don't get full credit for your hard work. At first I thought it was my phone but nike and map my run kept up with the GPS perfectly. I love the simple design of this app along with the options for interval training but teleporting me on the map and giving credit for 0.5 miles when I've done 1.5 miles sucks.",

        "comment": "I was very skeptical about being able to do the C25K training as it is detailed out, especially with the jump to running 20 mins straight in week 5 after never running more than 8 mins. I have been pleasantly surprised! The controls are very easy to use. The only time I have had issues w/ GPS is when running on a track in the local YMCA. Can switch between KM/Miles, can change how often the voice updates you on your pace (or whatever stats you choose for it to announce). I'm now at the end of week 6 and can say that the C25K program is the real deal and this app is a pretty decent app to assist with it. Having it log to MyFitnessPal automatically is also a very nice bonus.",

I've had nike+, addidas micoach, cardiotrainer (when it was active), and endomondo. I wish the interface was more \"up to date\". But the functionality is hands down the best right now.  2018 update.  I'm retiring this app in favor of S Health and my nike+ training apps. They've come a long way.  This one is great for specific training of races... But the others have more usefullness to me right now.  Last update for this app was a year ago, i hope they didn't abandon this.",

It had also failed to map my route. I tried again another day in case it had been a 1 off but alas no. My enthusiasm took a blow because I had been watching the seconds and sometimes minutes come off my pace! To make matters worse I've had no reply to the email I sent the developers. Poor, especially as I have now parted with money for the whole app. I've now gone on to another app but would use this again if it worked like it used to! :(",

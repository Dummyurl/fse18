Changing from 5 stars to 1 after my paid license was tossed in the trash by the developer and a monthly fee scheme was pushed out instead. First I tried emailing the address listed and when that that was returned undeliverable I decided to update my review.   FROM EMAIL : Hi,  I can find no way to get rid of the obnoxious ads that have appeared, other than subscribing - despite the fact I already purchased a license.   Please either let me know how to do so, forward me the old API for use with my license, or refund my purchase.   Thanks for your help  FROM ORIGINAL 5 STAR REVIEW : The only thing that 'was' missing, in my opinion, was the ability to create and save multiple, custom song lists, or \"programs\".  DEVELOPER: Please consider if it would be possible to add functionality to the song list:  multiple lists that can be named and saved in a \"library\", ability to add text line items to the song list (ones that don't require a key/pitch assignment)  Thanks",

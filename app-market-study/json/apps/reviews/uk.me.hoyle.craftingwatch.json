For those who are complaining it doesn't work on their phones lemme remind you... it's round, it's watch-shaped, it says it's a watch face, therefore it goes on a watch.",

It is, however, a good and simple reminder of the crafting strengths and weaknesses, and a great clock/lunar phase display. Not too stressful on the watch battery either.",

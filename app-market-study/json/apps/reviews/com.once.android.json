Actually they match you with guys who are the exact OPPOSITE of your type. Guys who I would give 1 star to (much like this app) Then they tell you to buy overpriced \"crowns\" to talk to someone who possibly rated you as high as you rated them. But they'll never put them in your matches to talk. This app is preying on lonely singles. They want your money, NOT your happiness. That's why it costs to do everything.",

        "comment": "You literally have to pay for almost the most basic of functions you'd expect out of a free app to meet people with. Like messaging. Or communicating at all. I literally have people wanting to message me and i can't even ACCEPT the invitation to communicate without using credits. And when you actually DO use the micro transaction method to do so with the little bit of free credits you start with, there is no way to get more without paying. For instance. \"Like the app on Facebook\" and get access to more \"credits\" to stockpile so you can talk to people, only to really never get them lol. It's a waste. I'm going back to tinder. I won't say the concept is nice, but it's different.....That's really it. So I'll give it 3 stars when it prolly deserves 1 for functionality.  Update: this app is terrible. You have to literally pay to talk to people before you even get a chance to see them or their profile when sent chat requests. And you still have to pay to initiate conversations too. So even if you do decide to pay to talk to somebody you can almost forget it that they'll pay to accept your invite to talk. Especially if they refuse to keep spending $10 every 2-3 people when's there's TONS of other apps that let you do that for free. I'm deleting this right after this review in hopes it helps somebody else.",

        "comment": "Once asks users to rate potential matches based on looks alone to find better match, but that is false, all but one of my matches are the complete opposite of what I am looking for, and doesn't take into account other attributes I am looking for in a potential match. Also to begin a chat it costs two crowns from you and 2 crowns from the person you want to chat with, making it much less likely they will accept the chat. A better app is Coffee meets Bagel; it's similar, but less expensive, better settings, and more potential matches, without being overwhelming.",

I had to go on the website to do this however they didn't actually end my subscription even though I had cancelled the subscription and deleted my account. Thought it was weird i had no confirmation email, had to go on Google play and it was still active so had to cancel from there. Don't bother with this waste of time",

I only have a problem with the fact that you have to pay when someone else wants to talk to you. They already paid to write a message I presume, why should I pay to accept the message? Maybe it's an idea to be able to accept it without being able to view the profile (that would be free). That way, you need to make a conversation to get to know the person.",

I advise that all users only use a minimal amount of coin or proceed with caution until this application has been audited thoroughly in production.   When a software company claims their software is open-source I expect for them to list the full source code such as a github repository upon releasing. This isn't the case with Aegis Wallet and I've had to manually request the release of the source code.   The end-user needs to be made fully aware of how certain applications handle their financial data, private keys, and/or Bitcoins. A slick shiny UI can be nice but in all reality just because it says it's \"encrypted\" doesn't necessarily make it so.  Look forward to the 'opening of the source' and thoroughly vetting this application.",

These questions were some of the first I've had. After I figured out those answers, I began to wonder how I can secure my few coins and not let the bad guys steal them from me. I hear stories about people losing their wallets or whatnot, and yet here I stand, in defiance, with my phone raised in the air proclaiming, 'I will not let you steal my coins, minions of evil!' Thanks to this app, I can say that with confidence now (because frankly, I was bluffing before... ). I enjoy that this app gives little tidbits and helpful information as to how to download, store and secure my coins. Maybe the world isn't such a bad place. Well, it probably is, but at least my bitcoins are secure, and if apps were made of hope, then I'm a little hopeful.   Best. thang. evar.",

It does need work in the visual department though, it looks rather blurry on a high DPI screen as if images are being used to create the visual elements instead of the native SDK. Please don't try to reinvent the UI wheel on android and just focus on building a nice wallet, there was nothing wrong with the reference wallet's UI. A testnet mode would also be nice.",

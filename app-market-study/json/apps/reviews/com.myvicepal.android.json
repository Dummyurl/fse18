They're not providing a service, they're just unlocking a feature and *renting* it to you.  No thanks.  I might have been willing to pay a fair amount to unlock the perfect buzz feature permanently, maybe 5 to 10 bucks, and that's a princely sum for an app that has to do so little.",

And it would probably be best to add the drink while you're drinking it, but the results will be similar either way (unless you drink reaaaally slow). And remember, this is all estimations so it won't be your real BAC at any point in time anyways.",

I have a Moto 360 and it's nice integration so you don't need to pull out your phone to enter drinks in case your phone isn't right there. The one thing I don't see that I'm able to do is see my BAC on the watch itself. I can enter drinks but if I want to see my BAC and time graph I need to pull out my phone. I don't know how difficult it would be to implement this but being able to see this info on a small watch screen instead of my phone would be a little more \"discreet.\" Overall great app and I could see this helping to know when to say \"no thanks\" to the next round at happy hour! 4 stars now would make 5 if the additional data was on the watch.",

See how the alcohol effects the heart would also play in to a more accurate bac count.  Maybe a motion detection on a per drink basis calculating sips per drink.  So much potential for this app.  Keep it coming.",

I took 1 star off the initial 5 for no option to customise drinks and save them (there are different kinds of beers, wines, spirits, quantities and alc. %... 1 for the same thing via wear and 1 more for how buggy the wear implementation actually is. I am keeping 1 star on the side in good faith that the dev might fix these issues in no time. Keep up the good work.",

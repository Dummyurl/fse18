Would love to see a timer / interval timer added to the app as well.   Seems to work on the phone. Can't get past the first screen on the watch though. Also, every time I open the app I get the tutorial pages again.  Tutorial is on the phone. And its a Ticwatch S with Android Wear 2.8. Would love to be able to use this.",

Putting the buttons at the bottom in the cards theme is a good idea, I'll see if I make this an option in the settings or change the theme itself. More customization is something I might add in a future release.",

        "comment": "I couldn't believe how poor the stopwatch selection was for Android Wear coming form a Pebble. Something basic like laps missing was a deal breaker and if you left the app up you couldn't tell the time. This app fixes those basic problems. I still wish there was one stop watch and timer app with even more functions, but this is more than adequate and better than the stock option. Being able to change the lap from the card and not opening the app is very handy.",

Basically it's useless for timing things with any degree of accuracy. This app fixes all that, looks better and backs up the results. Should be the standard for all Wear devices!",

It takes a few tries to sync to my phone, but that's really my only major complaint.  And Electric Wave is pretty good about updating.  It might not do things like best lap or average lap times, but at least you can delete laps and most importantly, export to XLS format.  And did I mention it's probably the best stopwatch on Android wear?",

        "comment": "The app does as promise in my sony smartwatch with a sony xperia z2. But there is plenty of room to improvement.  1st when I open the app it connect the phone to the gopro WiFi which is great, but when I close the app the phone get stuck in the gopro wifi which doesn't happen with the gopro app, it reconnect to the previous WiFi when the app closes, it would be nice to have that functionality.  2nd Is nice to have all the setitngs in the smartwatch but it would be better if it tells you which settings are on/off  3rd and most important to me, could be possible to connect the gopro directly to the smartwatch Wifi? that would be great and is what I'm looking for, I hate that I need the phone to connect to the gopro while my smartwatch has a WiFi built in.   Thanks.",

Customer service is great, I had an issue with the app once downloaded, and the developers were very helpful, and resolved the issue. Now that everything is working, I love the app.",

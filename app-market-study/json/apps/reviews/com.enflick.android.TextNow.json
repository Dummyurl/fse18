I've had this app for almost 4 years and for the past year it would crash, bug my phone,  and I can never seem to get in a full phone conversation anymore. It is inconvenient and infuriating. I have given feedback on multiple occasions and they never seem to fix it. Uninstalling",

I highly recommend bringing your own device if it is capitible to use through text now service. However, if you are looking for something to temporarily get you by and need a phone plan and phone that is cheap. Text now is your go too.",

I decidee to let him use my cell because I had a tablet & this was a great option for us. We both have had problems with this app... shutting down mid-way through phone calls/texts AND locking up our devices because the app runs so slow. Another feature that I feel like this app should add.... is a contacts list. Just like on a regular cell phone. I have people on my contacts list that I would love to get rid of and it's IMPOSSIBLE to do so on this app. How could a calling/texting app not think of making that easier?!",

Goal is capped at 9000 steps, which is pretty low  LG G watch + Moto X gen 1   Update: Goal is now capped much higher at 20k, and steps no longer reset on watch face reset. Thanks for the updates! This morning, my steps weren't reset from the day before, but not sure yet if that has been fixed in today's update. Goal and step count still seem to be independent from Fit numbers (when I got the new version, my step count reset). Update 2: The steps seem to reset randomly at no meaningful interval. I would expect them to reset at midnight. Basically the information displayed doesn't mean a thing because it's not constrained in a way that's obvious to me as a user.",

At least with the Google fit it kept counting my steps after l reached my set goal. This set the counter back as soon as l reached my 10,000 steps. I want to know my total for the day with a reset at midnight. Guess I will have to keep searching.  Sorry for the low rating guys /gals. It just didn't cut the mustard.",

For example, I have several watch faces, including Google Fit that are showing about 1200 steps after being up for a couple of hours and this one is still showing zero.   It is a shame because I really like the look of the watch face, however it needs to count in the background or better yet, pull the step numbers from Google Fit.  Would probably be 5 stars otherwise.",

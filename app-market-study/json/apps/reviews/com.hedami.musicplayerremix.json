I walk 1-2 hours and hear about 50% of the same songs everyday, I have 800 songs on my phone and like everyone of them. Second, when you try and fast forward to the next song you didn't hear the day before it gets stuck on one song and takes me 5 minutes to find the  main menu to switch back to shuffle, which sucks while you are trying to get some exercise. Third, why did they hide the main menu, I have a Samsung S7 Edge and have a heck of a time trying to find the menu to reset my shuffle.",

There is a trial version if you're unsure, but when you play around with it you'll more than likely want the full version. Love the 5, 30, 60 second rwd/ffwd feature and that I can open it over other apps.",

        "comment": "This app was amazing when I first got it, until the shuffling got reworked and started shuffling your entire playlist instead of randomly selecting a track from the alphabetically ordered library. You can still get it to work properly if you load up your entire library and then manually change the playlist to shuffle, but that's far from ideal while on the road, and worse still it seems to still play the next consecutive track before actually shuffling. Lyrics broke a while back too. Used to be 5/5. \ud83d\ude27",

Every time I try to play a song from an artist that has multiple songs, it point blank refuses to play that particular song and instead runs though every other song by that artist in quick succession with no music playing until it reaches the last song and just plays that instead. It ONLY does this when connected to my Chromecast Audio. This needs fixing ASAP.",

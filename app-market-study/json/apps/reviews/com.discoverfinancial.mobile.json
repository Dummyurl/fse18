I've been turned down for a credit increase from$200. You know what 25% utilization rate is on $200???!! $25!! Why have a cc that I can only charge $25 to a month? Looking into other cc companies.",

However, when I tried to write back, my message could not be sent. I got an error saying that the conversation was already resolved. I deleted the app's data from my phone, which got rid of the unsent message. The problem isn't resolved though. At the top of the Messaging screen a message says \"Connecting...\" , then \"Still trying to connect...\", but nothing happens. I still can't write back. When I try to send a message, it says I have no internet connection, which is not the case. I tried to submit this error through Secure Inbox, but the Send buttongl would do nothing.",

It seems to constantly forget that I already set up a passcode or fingerprint and will repeatedly ask me to request/enter verification codes. The app needs a visual update. They also need to create widgets that actually work too. I must add, these issues aren't exclusive to Android. Although I seem to have less problems on iOS, some of these exact same concerns happen on both platforms. Lastly, functions/features seem to be down quite often due to maintenance, and maintenance takes longer than any other banking institution I have ever used. By far.",

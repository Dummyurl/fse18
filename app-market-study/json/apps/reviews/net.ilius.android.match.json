One odd feature is that some fields from the old website are still visible on the app, but not anymore on the new website. Unlike the UK version of the new website, the app also allows searching by metric height, good for people like me not familiar with feet/inches.",

Sick to the back teeth of reading profiles of guys (sorry men!) who like glasses of wine, DVDs and blazing log fires! Photos of people covering their eyes with sunglasses or pints of lager in hand! Is this what life has become for the over 40s?",

Sends emails with the same problem. Now I just get the generic email saying people have viewed... not who specifically has and when you log in there's no new views. Personally had good success from the format but this app specifically is an absolute joke. If I was one of the devs who created this I'd be feeling very embarrassed!",

Very unreliable. Then messages you have read still show as unread. But my biggest bugbear of all, has to be that once I created my profile on desktop, when I went to edit it on my phone things like my bio just disappeared completely. Changes made on the app don't seem to be replicated on desktop. Also, searching through profiles is a pain without being able to look at someone's profile in detail without adding them to your favourites first. But then you can't remove them from your favourites either so they think they are your favourites while in fact after reading their profiles you're not interested",

Unless you add on upgrades I really don't think you are actually getting a service any better than the free sites that are out there.

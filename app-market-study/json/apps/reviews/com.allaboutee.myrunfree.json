        "comment": "Good functionality on watch, but the app icon on the phone is a complete waste of space, since it is unneeded. Opening the app on the phone literally says that it is unneeded.  To the developer: if you look at other wear-only apps like Slumber, there is no app icon on the phone. Regarding uninstalling, you can go into your main application list to uninstall (from settings) or directly uninstall from Google Play. Maybe an option to hide the app icon would satisfy everyone.",

If this is your only complaint please consider changing the rating you gave it, once the rating falls below 3 I stop updating an app since the effort is not worth the reward, and the app has no ads either. Thanks.",

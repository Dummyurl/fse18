        "comment": "This has so far been the most reliable HR monitor I have used with my wear watch. However, there are a few things that prevent me from giving it more stars. 1:  It places an alarm status in the status bar. This drove me nuts!  I couldn't figure out why I had an alarm when I hadn't set one in the clock app. I finally figured out that it was HRP because I had it set to read automatically from my watch every 15 mins. 2:  Since I'm using my wearable to take readings, I don't require the use of the camera for them. But, when I launch the app (to look at the history) it want to take a reading with the camera. Thus the LED lights up. It would be nice to have a toggle.  EDIT:  There IS an option in the latest version to open the app in history. 3:  Finally, I'd like to see more history than the last 7 readings. Perhaps daily, weekly, monthly charts. Other than these slight personal issues, this has been by far the most reliable heart rate monitor I've used with my wearable. Hoping to.see.some improvements with future releases.  EDIT 3/2/18:  Appears ALL my concerns have been addressed. 5 stars and thank you!",

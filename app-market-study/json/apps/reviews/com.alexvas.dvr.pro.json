        "comment": "Superb app. Wanted something to consolidate a couple of different cameras that came with their own bespoke apps and for various reasons I was completely unimpressed with several that I tried - then I found the free version of this. Scanned the network and immediately found and configured both cameras, the interface is highly polished and user friendly, it's full of useful options, the PTZ controls are brilliant... I could even flip the controls just vertically for one camera that irritatingly had them back to front just in that direction. Immediately bought the pro version to get rid of the ads (not that they're intrusive) and unlock recording and chromecast facilities. Very happy!",

In my personal testing, using network scan - advance mode. It can detect the cameras using several listed model configurations in the database, but all fails to display a video stream/feed. All fails even re-configuring. I hope there will be more support in the future. Thanks.",

I have tried other apps including the one recommended by the  camera manufacturer and the NVR manufacturer but I  could never get the individual camera that triggered the motion detection to alert me it was always the same camera as if it was the default. This app alerts me from each individual camera that's detected any motion.   I don't have pan & tilt or audio cameras but so far everything else that I want  works and I'm very pleased with this app, hence I give it 5 star.",

Five stars now, really happy with it!   -------- This app works reasonably well with my camera, until I try to use ssl for privacy. At that point, it fails to connect to my camera, while other apps are able. Unfortunately, that's one feature that's critically important to me.  I'm sure it's a nightmare, to support hundreds of camera models, but when I emailed dev for support, I never received an answer.",

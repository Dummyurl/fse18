Tapping the center changes the color scheme, and you lose those settings. Maybe it'll get some bug fixes in the future.",

One major issue I have is that if you allow interactivity and touch the digital clock then you lose your custom colors and it cycles through presets. This is really annoying, and the only way to avoid it is to completely turn off interactivity and that stops a lot of other features. I really wish there was just a setting to turn that off.",

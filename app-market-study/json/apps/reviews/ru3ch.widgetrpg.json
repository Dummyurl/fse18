And then I realized that the widget is supposed to be an ugly little thumbprint, and the actual game takes place in the app which you have to manually open, making the widget completely redundant. I'm sure the game is fun but why bother with the widget element if it's executed this stupidly?",

Open the game itself (application) to find out what happened (how were your taps transformed). We added other options to play the game - Tap Head, Tap by Voice and taps on Android Wear device but the main idea stays the same.",

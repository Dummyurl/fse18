I seggest some improvement like:  1 - Save to any folder of SD Card which is allowed now in Android 5.0.2 2 - ISO manual regulation (able in Sony Xperia Z3)  Another suggestion:  1 -  In the pro style add some kinds of professional grid to center the image. 2 - Image stabilization, in the stock camera is the option and here does not appear.. 3 - An option to change icons colours, in some circunstances is difficul to see in white.  Question:  The icon of chromecast in the upper right of the screen I dont know how to use it. Is it needed to stay in the main screen ?",

I can see that it just have useful icons which clutters the screen and opening camera is really fast. However, icons is black and when using app to take photos at night seems to be hard to find out which icons we need, and this app also did not have customize solution of pictures. Hope you will update with fixed problems i write above. In common, this app is perfect and it won't waste your money.",

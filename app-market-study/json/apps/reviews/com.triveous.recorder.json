I recently signed up for 12 months of pro and for some reason this week I can no longer share the files properly via wetransfer like I always have and it will only share a txt version of the file which is utterly useless to me. Everything worked fine last week and now it doesn't work at all. It also wants me to sign up for pro per month on top of the 12 months I've already paid for. If it's necessary to pay for both, fine but I at least want to be able to share my files easily",

I hate this! :-(  Also the moment I do a second recording, it automatically writes over the first file valid file. Not Cool. Important Audio Lost....! But either way, I have chosen to discard this application from my devices for good and move on to other Better Quality Ones. (Sighs..)",

This is not good because it I want to back it up onto my computer or flash drive, I will not be able to identify the recording. Please fix it. I recorded a 3 hour lecture and paused it. I accidentally closed the app. Now the recording says it is 0 seconds long. The description says that the recording would be saved if the phone lost battery. Why did it lose the recording?",

This has made me realize how unreliable it is; roughly 50% of all of my recordings end up being about a minute or so of silence instead of the 30+ minutes they should be.   Everything looks like it's recording, but when all is said is done it hasn't. I'm not sure what the problem might be, but it renders the entire app untrustworthy.  When it does work, it works well though.",

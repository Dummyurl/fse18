Being able to map the swypes and taps to hotkeys on the computer-especially ones that control a tasker on the computer-would be fantastic. I'd donate to that no problem. It's oriented sideways on the Moto 360 btw. Up is right, right is down, etc. And the pattern doesn't fit the screen properly. I'd have given this a one or a two star of it wasn't sill in beta testing.",

        "comment": "This works brilliantly but is predictably of very limited use when it can send only five different keystrokes to the PC. Can't wait for a customisable version so I can for instance send the keypress 'C' to my media player software (which pauses and unpauses music playing on my PC). Will definitely upgrade this to a five-star review if and when I can do this from my wrist! Edited to add: oh, just realised this only seems to work if the mobile app is running in the foreground - would be far better if it could work with it in the background on the mobile.",

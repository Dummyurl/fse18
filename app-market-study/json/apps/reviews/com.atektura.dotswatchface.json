Maybe external app options to show at the top and bottom in the same style as the date and battery. Personally I'd like to have my polar flow exercise progress on there. Otherwise I love it, great looking clean face",

Could be better with improvements to make the seconds ticker smoother. Colour schemes are welcome, but needs some refinement, would be nicer to just have different color options on the dial, rather than the background and this added outer-ring , current color options detract from the lovely design of the original. Just my opinion :-)",

This causes the two layers to overlap, decreasing visibility. I hope a fix for this comes out soon. I would also like it if I could select from playlists, as it gives a lot more choice for the user. I look forward to seeing any improvements you might bring to the app from now on.",

        "comment": "Hey, great work. This is a great app; very useful for picking artists/albums/songs from my vast music library. Opens up a whole new use for my watch. So far I have not ran into any bugs. Very handy.  I own an LG Watch Style with a crown scroller. My only complaint (and the reason I give it 4 stars) is that the crown whirly doesn't scroll through the library lists as I feel it should, since it would match the rest of the watch UI. I know this probably isn't a bug, just something that hasn't been implemented yet. Overall a great app though, it's at the top of my favorite apps on my watch! EDIT: After using this app for a while, I've noticed that the scrolling wheel functionality works when you first open the app on the watch if the app was last open on a library list. The scroll wheel ability stops working as soon as you change lists, such as tapping an artist you want to hear. Hope you can fix this!",

Not that bluetooth connected headset or speakers aren't capable of the same, here you can see and navigate with ease and comfort of not getting to any device or remotes, only with the exception of Bluetooth headset. My most hoped function is missing however and would like to know if FAST FORWARD will be added in the future? I tried to hold the skip for over few seconds to no avail :( really sad because Power Amp is a perfect package from back in the days when it was only one of very few apps with built in graphic equalizer and now with wear, I do not regret I picked this over the other apps. Outperformed and outlived the ugly other ones, plus great constant support and improvements. Zenwatch 2 AW v1.5",

        "comment": "It's a shame the album browser is so different from how poweramp's normally functions - I'd really like the option to either group by album artist (instead of having a separate album entry for every single track artist that appears therein - VERY frustrating on albums with many different artists contributing to it!) and that generally all the caching and connecting is a little slow and flaky. Might need to exclude the service from some of the more aggressive battery saving I do on my phone, so I won't detract any stars for that! Still, the album list behavior is a definite spot for improvement.  Would love to contribute to this project if it's open sourced! I don't like to blindly ramble on about changes I'd like to see without attempting to contribute somehow. :)",

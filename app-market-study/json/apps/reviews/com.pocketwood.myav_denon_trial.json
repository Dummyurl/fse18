This is an awesome replacement, since the used remote that came with the Reciever is partly damaged from the previous user leaving old batteries in it that leaked acid and ate at part of the remote board, and I really didn't want to pay $70 for a used, rare to find remote (RC-1120).

I have bought couple universal remotes but it seemed like the only ones that were goin to work were gonna cost me $65+ dollars.

It wont retain the connection with my receiver after I turn the receiver off. Many times I have  do a force stop for it to recognize and connect with the receiver again. Im sure this isnt normal. Whats the issue?",

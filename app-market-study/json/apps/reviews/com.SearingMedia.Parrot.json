I am confused why bluetooth recording is limited to 8kHz, but given the experience I'm willing to assume that's google's fault",

As the button transforms, it's like there are remnants of a vector button shape. I use the app with a modified rom though, on a phone that doesn't even support Android 4.4.

I use it to record lectures in one of my art history classes and I can hear every word recorded so clearly! Even when the speaker has moved to the other side of the room it still picks it up crystal clear. Would definitely recommend to others.",

They take your money and give you nothing in return for it. Look elsewhere if you want to support devs who care about their customers.",

In my current use case, I didn't have an extra keyboard and mouse for setting up a Raspberry Pi, so I used this app to control my windows pc while having my real keyboard and mouse hooked to the Raspberry Pi. It works perfectly!  Ive also used this app to control my PC from the bed for watching Amazon video or whatever.",

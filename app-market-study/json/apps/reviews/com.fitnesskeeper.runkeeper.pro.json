What better way to flatten your resolution to start running?  ***********  It took them a few days to get back to me but once connected, they were quick in restoring the subscription. I love the fact that I got some of the workout history back from the trial before. So far, very happy.",

The only problem I have seen is that if I pause a run and re-start, sometimes the timer keeps going but it won't track distance traveled.

        "comment": "It's a well rounded app. I've been using it since 2012, so I've got a fair amount of experience with it. The app has great features like audio pass through when listening to music, and updates on your pace and distance. Some downsides include that if you forget to hit stop, your data for the run is essentially null and void, you have to way to adjust your time after a run. A cool rectification for this would for it to auto stop after a certain distance. Another downside isn't really the apps fault, but phone location tracking isn't always 100% accurate, so a measured 5km run, may only work out to be about 4.8km after you use your GPS.",

Now, the app crashes whenever I try to manually enter my weight or an activity. At first I thought it was an issue with my phone. But I've upgraded to a much better phone and I have the same problem. I think it's possibly an android development problem. Except for that issue, it works great!",

A notification popped up about new runs while I was out walking and then promptly disappeared. After that I was never able to find the rest of my planned runs. It still said it would \"send the next week's workouts on Sunday\" well into Monday. Training plans require me to input the times to run one at a time, manually. If I'm going to do that why don't I just write down my own plan on a piece of paper and save my money?",

        "comment": "Very prone to crashing when saving run details or trying to fix GPS. The run time and GPS route details do seem to save though.  Audio cues for pace at 1 km splits seem to be out quite often, doing things such as giving you the pace for the first few seconds of the new split, or combining splits, meaning that you often can't rely on the audio cues to provide meaningful information. Audio cues have been broken for quite some time.  It also assumes that the start of the week is on Sunday, rather than the international standard of Monday (ISO-8601), and there's no way to alter it.  It also doesn't seem to use make use of other onboard sensors to auto detect and correct for GPS problems. You have to manually go and click on the map and then on the fix GPS button.  I've been using RunKeeper for years, but I'm going to try an alternative app out.",

But when I'm watching the app, it's hard to know where I really am at for meps.  I've uninstalled the app 4 times now, and still not getting accurate readout of meps, until it uploads my workout.  Other than this issue, it's a decent app.  If you have the myzone belt, you really have no other option. I think the app is not that user friendly, and I've been using for 10 months now!  It's just set up kind of awkward, where it opens up at, and when you hit back once, it asks if you really want to close.  Oh and even though I have set my app up to not ask for pictures, and every single time I click DO NOT ASK AGAIN, it still asks me after every workout.  Kind of annoying!",

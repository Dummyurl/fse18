        "comment": "I don't know who these guys are, but they must be geniuses! Whenever they show up with a new app I think \"well... just another Android Wear app. I don't think it'll do anything new to my watch.\" Then BAAAM! I install it and I realize that this is the function I definitely needed on my watch! It's unbelievable. I can't believe that Google didn't include these apps originally on their Android Watches because they are SO useful and a must have! For example their Wear Mail app. How else could you read and reply to your emails on your watch without a phone? Or their Wear Calendar app! How else could you view and even edit events and add new entries on your watch without phone? Other apps are not able to do that! The Wifi Manager is also very helpful, because with that you can login to other (not saved) Wifi networks without your phone when you are on the go! Their Wear Weather app is also one of my favorites! It's very simple but surprisingly accurate and REALLY works. Other weather apps for Android Wear maybe look fancier but they keep forgetting settings, units changing back to Fahrenheit from Celsius, etc... Very frustrating to use them. But appfour's weather app works like a charm!",

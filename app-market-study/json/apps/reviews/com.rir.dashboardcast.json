Yes there are glitches but it deserves a better rating so giving it 5 stars. Also donated $5 to remove ads. Please keep working on this developer. It's good to see something more than the usual video casting apps!",

Two tweaks I'd love to see; My Google Keep reminders as a widget, and some kind of alarm setting that would automatically cast it in the morning. Maybe IFTTT compatability?

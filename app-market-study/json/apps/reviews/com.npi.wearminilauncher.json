It seems like it is too little and sometimes the launcher gets overridden by the system launcher, which I don't want to happen.  Also, I would like the app to let me \"split\" the app drawer and the widget drawer into two different swipes. For example, when I swipe down I get the widget drawer and when I swipe right I get the app drawer.",

Because of that, all customizations are deleted and I have to do it all over again.  Aside of that deal breaker bug, the app is amazing, but essentially unusable.  I am using Huawei watch 2.  Edit: I have found what crashes the launcher. Whenever I try to use the brightness bar on the widget drawer, the app crashes. A simple solution is to simply disable it in the customization tab.",

        "comment": "I gave this app 3 stars reluctantly.   The app has a beautiful UI that the developers have incorporated a top Android Wear brilliantly.  The app screen and toggle screen are ingenious and look great!  Bringing new life to an aging Android Wear 1.5.  It really made my Moto 360 v1 and LG G Watch, who did not get the 2.0 update, look like new watches.  When it works, it works flawlessly but there lays the problem, it doesn't always play nice with Android Wear.  At times you get a slow choppy experience even painfully slow and it gets stuck from time to time.  I have also found that on occasion Android Wear will stop working al together and I find myself having to reboot my watch.  And, if you try to adjust the screen brightness on the toggle screen, forget about it. You will get a message saying Wear Mini Launcher has stopped working, and there is nothing you can do to fix this problem.  This is at least true on my LG G Watch, didn't dare try it on my 360.  Why? Because rebooting your watch, re-syncing your apps, none of it will work.  And if you try u installing you will find that quite simply, you can't!  The only solution is to system re-set your watch, in my case both watches and what a pain that is.  In short I really like this app and wish it didn't have these issues but for now I had to delete it.  Maybe with an update the developer can address these problems, but for now I guess I'll just have to keep using the dated Android Wear 1.5 on my watches.",

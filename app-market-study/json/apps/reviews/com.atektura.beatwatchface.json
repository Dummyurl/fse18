        "comment": "Only purchased this because I'm a live sound engineer and this is the only audio related face i can get on my watch. This face needs more detailed meters and information for a paid watch face. Should include at least a Battery level, another meter to make minutes more accurate, maybe a few faders or eq knobs to show dates/temp. Maybe a gain control or something off a channel on a mixer. This 3 meter should be free for the lack of functionality and features. Needs much improvement.",

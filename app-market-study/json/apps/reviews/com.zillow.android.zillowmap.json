So if a home just went pending or sold it shows on top of my list. I need scrool and find the actual for sale properties mixed in with the pending and sold ones. Terrible on Open house weekends when I'm trying to find the next house to visit. Terrible, terrible.",

I actually called them, got a voice mail saying that they may get back to me within 5 days. Zillow is a joke! I do not understand how it is supposedly the number one Realty website.

        "comment": "i love that the owner can upload new pics for chg of seasons outside etc and what i love section. Ease of use is great, as is customer service! There's only 1 area i feel that Zillow could improve on in my opinion- As a Owner- Agent the Virtual Tour Button is really hidden not even bolded under the MLS#. Ive noticed the Premier App (which I cant get into) & the regular cell video app will get your listing a Banner saying Video right on the Listing's Main Picture which is fine, if your willing to put up a video that you cant add in any music, pan, zoom or reduce glare or crispen up the Clarity of the video or add any Title to it. However, if you have a professional video or one youve made on your PC one cant get a Banner on the listings main photo and its such small print not underlined tucked 1/4 of the way down below the MLS# its very hard to readily notice! Where the uploaded Cell Video is instead given Bold Banner on the Main Picture with readily seen access! In my mind, BOTH the pro video or any video uploaded to YouTube should be given the same banner as the vids uploaded direct to Zillow thru their app via a cell phone. Plse. consider giving both forms of video's from cell or YouTube, the same equal highlite of the same banner on the listing's main picture! It shouldnt matter to Zillow which form you employed to get the Video there! and if one is trying to produce a better video lets face it a cell vid without PC editing cant get rid of direct sunlite glare from a window or shadows. So plse. dont penalize a YouTube Vid., bbut instead give those equal billing of the same banner to even the playing field between competition, so the pro video has the same importance of the same billung as the cell video using your apps. Zillow is the only R.E. website, that almost hides the Virtual Tour button for a YouTube video. If Zillow would do this, you'd be in aces!",

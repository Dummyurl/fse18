        "comment": "After sitting on this app for a few days it decided to work. The one major issue now that I can actually use the app is it resizes pictures into squares distorting faces and the like. Also, load times are very long, which is probably why I thought the app was nonfunctional at first. Fix these two problems and you'll have five stars. I have an HTC One M7 phone for the record.",

I most definitely did NOT like trying to scan the SAME EXACT CODE forever. Either it would prompt me to put the code in view of the camera (while it's taking up most of the screen), or tell me to let the phone focus (while in focus) to then turn completely blurry, focus in and out, then finally be crystal-clear, and ask for the code to be put in view again. Ugh.",

I couldn't figure out how to get the exact plain text encoded in the QR for types other than plain text (ex: vCard). It would also be great if it could directly connect to Wi-Fi without a separate plugin.",

Both are fine with qrcodes, but i-nigma just couldn't compete on straight barcodes. I only found one blue-tinted bar that both i-nigma and zxing couldn't read, but switching to the zapper engine worked. I also like that QR Droid tells you what kind of code you just scanned. The only dislike I have is that the interface is rather unprofessional, esp. the comic font. Otherwise this is definitely the best.",

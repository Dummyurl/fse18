        "comment": "The locking part works awesome very easy to set, but the timer part is very complicated and of no use, I appreciate the developer for his effort for UI but the timer is very tough and it only has start timer no setting to turn it off and go to the previous profile. Kindly make changes to it and put it easy as to set the timer on at a particular time and to get back to the default setting which is previously set or the profile which the user want to set after the profile is timed, we have a small Android Club in Brisbane-Australia and we all would like to download the app with this feature. There are lots of App having a perfect timer thing but they lag with the locking feature. This app has a perfect locking feature but lags with the timer thing...Kindly see to it and update, as I am sure you can do it  Thanks",

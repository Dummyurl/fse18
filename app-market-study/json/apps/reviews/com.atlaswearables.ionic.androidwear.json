        "comment": "Atlas doesn\u2019t track exercises regardless of claims. Training exercises works most of the time by the exercise cannot be determined even when a custom workout has been laid out. Any notification will Freeze/ Crash the app during a workout. Used the app for 3+ months and it\u2019s never tracked an exercise correctly during the exercise used the app for mostly tracking what exercises I had planned to perform.  I\u2019ve also been in contact with their support because the directions on setting up the app and training exercises were poor. I\u2019m using the LG Watch Urbane. I cannot recommend the app",

Cant modify number of reps and weight used on the fly either, only add missing. Long way to go on this app, 'exercise tracker' is much better, atlas could do with following its ui and usability.",

However, while the website states that the app supports heart rate monitors, this is the case only for those built into watches, not for chest straps. This should be properly stated. Thus only 4 stars from me for now.",

I'm happy to report the crashing has gone away on my LG Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, but there are still some issues with duplicate entries and reps not being recognized.  I will try some tips from Atlas on how to improve the detection.    I'm very excited about this app since there really isn't any other app like it on Android Wear.  There are a lot of workout trackers for phones, but for the growin",

Wildly inaccurate for counting reps of simple exercises, and registers reps for exercises that are not even close to the motions that I'm currently doing. Constant crashes on the Huawei watch, fails to sync properly on a regular basis, and heart rate monitoring is way off. App will also not recognize custom exercise motions, making it impossible to teach it motions from scratch.  If possible, I would like a refund. Was very excited to hear of the features and functionality of this product, but poor execution makes this disappointing.",

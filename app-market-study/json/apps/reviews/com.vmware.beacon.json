Also I couldn't see a single option for any types of vMotion, or the ability to view datastores, or manage cluster settings.  Great app with very limited functionality.",

But when I try and restart a guest or shutdown a guest or even the host all I get is that the app terminated unexpectedly. It could be that I am running Android 6.0 now and this app might not be updated for it. But please fix!",

Also I cannot use my USB keyboard with this app. I can use it with all of the other apps that use the keyboard the phone is set to. I have not not tried but i have a feeling it will not work with bluetooth or physucally attached keyboards. Long story short, allow me to set the keyboard. Fix this issue and then I will give it 5 stars.",

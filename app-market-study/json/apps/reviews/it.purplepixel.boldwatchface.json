The secondd ripple is drawed on the dim screen for esthetic reasons: the time \"freeze\" and the ink too. \nA new release is available and it's shipping a updated handheld app with a new Performance panel; from here you can change your watch face Frame Rate to Normal, Acceptable or Clumsy to save battery life. Enjoy!",

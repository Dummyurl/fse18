        "comment": "this was a much better app when it was partnered with spotify. I was trying to get a feel of how the app is without a subscription. But the ADS are just too much. They force 10-15 second ads on you FAR too often for me to want to give money. Not impressed.   Also, this app has a built in 'player' that sounds like utter trash. Comparing it to spotify's level of streaming and playback, this sounds gargled and excreted in comparison. Within seconds you can hear the shrill piercing treble of each song.",

And I was even ready to pay, right to the moment it turned out to be a monthly subscription, not a one time order. I need this app like three times a year when I feel like it to listen to some rap albums, not going to pay every month or full year up front for that. Your search is just awful. There's no easy way to find one artist, then see all his albums, then see all the songs from the albums. I'm out.",

Used to love it earlier, even have a subscription. But now it just plain and simple pathetic. Random crashes, bugs and now not even able to make a lyrics card. I click on the option and nothing happens. Have a lot of things in life to be irritated from, now this app is also becoming an integral part in irritating me. I'll wait for the next update and if these  bugs and crashes are not fixed I am going to cancel my subscription and Uninstall this jet lag of a app.",

I'd rather go to an online site thay provides well organized lyrics with romanized, translated or just the lyrics, play music on my usual music player. Done",

When I open the lyrics, for a split second they're in sync and then the app kicks the lyrics back up to the beginning of the song and it never syncs up again. It will start scrolling through from the beginning no matter where in the song I am. So irritating. I don't want the floating lyrics on all the time but I like being able to open lyrics mid-song.  I can't do that anymore. It's stupid because when I open the app, it's in the right place but \"loading\" the lyrics when they're opened screws everything up.  Paid version. Waste of money.",

However, the notifications are irritating, and the pop up lyrics are also annoying. The little button should appear instead of the lyrics appearing by default when a song is detected. The lyrics sometimes sync with what your are listening to, sometimes it just displays the lyrcis in a list as if it didn't know the timing although it did last the previous time on the same song. It's also nagging when it asks you about your feelings about a song. I don't mind the little upgrade button, but this message covers a significant portion of the lyrics and is just there as a form of psychological punishment for being stingy and not buying the subscription, I'm convinced.",

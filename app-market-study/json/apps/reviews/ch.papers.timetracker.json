        "comment": "As far as I can tell, the only way that this app functions on my Zenwatch 2 is if I start the app on my phone. Once you start the app on your phone, it parks what seems to be a button at the bottom of the screen to toggle the time tracking functionality on/off. But the button itself remains static, except for a short vibration that indicates you pressed it, so you can't be sure if the app is actually tracking your time or if it's standing by waiting to be activated because it doesn't change to indicate one way or another. I thought that the watch app would be more independent of the phone app, but it seems that you need to control most functionality of the watch app through the phone app. This makes the watch aspect of the app less than ideal, and the watch integration is what attracted me in the first place. And to those who think I may have something wrong with the Smart Time Tracker app on my watch, I thought the same thing when I first saw the less than stellar watch experience with this app. But even after a factory reset, I was presented with the same lackluster functionality.",

The watch interface is my primary point of interaction. so this is not to important.  A web-interface for interacting with the phone application through your desktop browser would also be positively awesome.  Great beginnings and good potential.  I see one improvement for the watch interface as well: Start the timer when selecting a project.  Adding custom images would also be appreciated.",

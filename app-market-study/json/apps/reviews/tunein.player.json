It's gone from an ad, to a couple, to sometimes 3 ads with a ten second gap between each one so it's.well over a minute before I hear my radio station. In and out the car all day means it also stopped each time I turned off the car so I'd deal with the ads ten or more times a day.  I'm now just using the browser option to listen online to my radio station, so much simpler for what I need.",

It was a great app before when it had audio books then it was a excellent app. I would recommend the free version and not the paid service with audio books gone now you can use a combination of other apps and get what this app offers and end up saving money.",

And with no way to edit the home page layout, the home page becomes useless but to those looking for new things, so really it should be a find your next listen section then a home section. Maybe the premium one is better in layout ,but for the free version  rhe layout is really kind of a joke for convience and personal experience. I only keep it since tunein seems to have contracts with some of my podcast to get episodes earlier then other players,but I really would like to get rid of it.",

When I do bam it kicks back and I listen the same thing over and over to the point that I finish the program 10-15 minute pass the end of the show. Iheart does not do this .

I get no search results but if I look up the search term twit I get a list of all the TWIT shows including the new screensavers. I think this might be the reason why TuneIn Radio doesn't work very well with Google Assistant. Also a big thing is that TuneIn Radio Pro version app doesn't work at all with Google Assistant. If I uninstall the ad supported TuneIn Radio on my pixel 2 XL phone then Google Assistant can't find TuneIn Radio it says it's not installed even though I have the pro version installed. Is there a way to use TuneIn Radio free version and upgrade to the pro version within the ad-supported version that might be a work around until you fix the problem. I use Tunein radio all the time with Google assistant. In my kitchen when I'm feeding my dog Ozzy. I really would like this to work. I sent you in a similar bug report to Google about this issue. Maybe you guys can get together and fix this issue.",

There's no excuse of 'life got in the way'.   As soon as you install the app and have the trial, immediately head to your Google Play subscription list and cancel it. You still get the trial, but instead of automatically renewing your subscription, it just stops after 30 days. There's no excuse anymore, this is why these app customer service departments refuse to reimburse; because it's literally that simple to not get charged for your trial right after you install it.  As for the app itself, I've noticed a lot of changes since I've last used it. not too happy about the recording option no longer being available apparently. Doesn't make it worth it for me to spend money or have on my device when the shows I listen to put out a podcast anyway.",

        "comment": "UPDATE: The widgets are still intensley annoying. TuneIn takes up a huge amount of memory on a phone (Samsung S7 so no slouch) because it wants to run in the background all the time. I am constantly going into Settings/Apps to force to stop. The TuneIn people have the plot, users don't count to them anymore FFS.    A recent update has ruined it. Every time they update this app it is worse. Now I am given a widget with a list of Recently Played, how am I expected to get back to the main player to turn it off? There should be an off button on the widget and Favorites NOT Recently Played. It has been so poor lately I am having to delete the cache and force a Stop to unfreeze the app. Why is this app so difficult to use? It's too complicated KISS!",

If you've already been had by one of their recent app updates, what recourse do we have now that you've violated our trust, and distributed our information, like sim card data, etc.? Update: Recent updates to the app have dialed back the info harvesting according to Norton, indicating only location harvesting which drains the battery. I know this because TuneIn keeps the WiFi turned on looking for a location even though I keep wifi turned off.  Also, how can we now believe these folks haven't blocked Norton from seeing their previous harvesting of personally identifiable information like Simcard Data, voicemail number, device type model, etc.?  All this info gets sold to data miners, retailers, political marketers, and others to build profiles on us and manipulate our perceptions with their targeting efforts. Its really a dark new world and I am losing trust in these commercial outfits more and more.",

So 50% of the use cases for this are basically not possible.  IDK why the devs would deliberately limit their app like this.  And the alternative apps aren't any better.  I wish someone would look at Coffee's UI and functionality and use that as a model for a good wearable messaging app.    Uninstalled.",

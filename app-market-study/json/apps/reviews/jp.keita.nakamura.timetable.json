        "comment": "This is a really good app, from what I've seen so far. The reason it gets 4 stars is because I think it should have a way of editing the room and teacher for a registered subject on a period-by-period basis. Right now I have to have a separate registered subject for each different room, or I have to have unregistered subjects. Neither option is particularly desirable. Other than that though this app is great and I still highly recommend it.",

I would much prefer reducing it to banners only instead of popups. The Android Wear support is as a concept very helpful, but what I'm missing the most is the ability to scroll back and forth between days instead of having just the current day on screen.",

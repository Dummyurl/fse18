        "comment": "Seems to work well, and is accurate enough for my needs. I was bummed to find out that all stats aren't saved for review after ending trip. All you're able to see after ending is a map view. Stats such as time, average speed, and maximum speed are lost as soon as you tap \"end trip\". If you're interested in saving those be sure to write them down someplace before you end. If saving those can be implemented somehow I would likely raise to 5 stars.",

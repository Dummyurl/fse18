It works very well with my VLC.  I highly recommend this app., and i paid the extra $7.99 for it to be ad-free. Even with the ads, it wasn't an annoyance, as it was just a small strip on the bottom....but much better without it, and less likely to accidentally tap on an ad.  The only thing i wish this app. would do is wake up the p.c.  It is able to put it to sleep, and does all ending power functions, including reboot, but it won't wake it up. Once the p.c. is running, it definitely works well, as previously mentioned. :-)",

You enter up to 50chars Max on your tablet or phone and then click a send button to transfer it to the PC.  More accurate and appears to have a more persistent connection than Intel remote keyboard. But 50 characters is to limiting. Works with voice to text, but cuts off after 50chars.",

I can leave my laptop connected across the room as a home theater device, and just pull out my phone as my touchpad when I want to navigate (everything: from Netflix to two finger scrolling in my browser).   Cons: For an app that is no longer supported, $11 CAD to remove an ad bar seems a bit steep to me. There's a delay which makes it inferior to a dedicated mouse or touchpad; easy to forgive when I remember that this is essentially a clever hack to turn my Android device into a wireless touchpad. Thanks for a great tool.",

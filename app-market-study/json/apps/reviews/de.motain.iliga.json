        "comment": "Very informative with lots of football videos that are fun to watch on the go. If choosing between this and BBC sport, I would have both. BBC sport is great for all round sports, including tennis and rugby and onefootball is better for football. However, for championship teams, not all players are registered and have a profile-something which would be a nice upgrade for the lower league supporters. Overall, a great app for viewing football anywhere and a good time killer for long journeys. Very informative and fun to use. For premier league fans, it probably is a 5-Star as the main focus is on that league.",

Still surprises me when it tells me there's a gol in my favorites' games and I don't even know they were supposed to be playing!. I didn't give it five stars because there must be some room for improvement like live updates with videos.  Thank you for the good work",

Which is Fulham's Ryan Sessegnon, but in the app it says Steven Sessegnon and when I check other social media platforms froms or go on the internet to check Fulham's number 3, it says Ryan and not Steven which it says on the app. Please could you look into this and change it!",

I have noticed that over turned decisions, when VAR gets involved, are not immediately translated into this app but VAR is a learning curve for everyone involved.   The reason for only 4*: Misleading notifications. Often they are just lies to get me to open the app. Some times I have already read an article and later there is a notification relating to that article which is misleading at best. I think it is unnecessary for an app so brilliant as this, to resort to tabloid click bait tactics.",

Other apps include a lot more leagues from areas like the Middle East, Africa, and Central and East Asia. No doubt you have many users from countries whose leagues aren't included, so I think that might be a nice addition. Also one thing I noticed is that some teams still have old badges rather their new ones, only one I noticed so far is Sydney FC but I'm sure there are more examples. If the dev team are having trouble keeping their app up to date, then I'm sure the userbase would love to help with that! :)",

I really enjoy seeing the club crests on the fixture screen as I find it easier to find games by the crests, rather than just the team names. Unfortunately the reason that I am writing this review is the infuriating click-bait titles that the app uses for it's notifications. The articles they offer provide great information but PLEASE just put the real article title in the notifications. For example, Onefootball had an article detailing Neymar's need to have surgery. Instead of pushing the real article title in the notification they instead wrote \"Brazilian star\" needs surgery. Today the notification said $42 million Atleti striker instead of just saying Jackson Martinez. The notifications for the articles will never use the players real names instead opting to be incredibly vauge to bait you into opening the app. At first this wasn't a huge deal, but over time this has become incredibly annoying especially when the articles are pretty short. In the end, the Sofa Score app is just better at pretty much everything. The UI may be a bit clunky and not as clean, but it has much more information than this app.",

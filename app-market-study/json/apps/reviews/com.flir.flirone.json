However FLIR updated the app and my phone updated it automatically, and now there is no more live view and the app doesn't really work. Very disappointed with losing the use of this expensive device.",

It's always asking for the camera to be reconnected, mis-reporting a low battery, and failing to load calibration data.  The latter is probably why it now shows all spot temperatures as '&lt;-50C'.  Did no one test this before release?",

Should have option to make view more compatible with device EX frame rate update, and resolution.  If I use my Flir one pro with the other thermal app the update on live view is GREAT not choppy BUT that app doesn't work right either. Anyway I really think you can do more to make these Flir ones more flexible with phones allowing more update settings to get the BEST viewing experience.  If you fix things I'll be sure to update review.  Fix you Flir tools app too see that review",

It's a function that's built into nearly all thermal imaging camera software, including Seek's.  At this point, without that functionality, I can't recommend the FlirOne due to this major oversight.",

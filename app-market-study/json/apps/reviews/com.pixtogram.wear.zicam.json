The app doesn't create a shortcut in you're phone ether which is awesome, installs directly to the watch and launches from there!",

Roll on the random pics. Thank you dev, I wasn't sure about the app but am happy I tried it. The app has quite a bit of lag tho which can be annoying at times. Look forward to an update that will fix this issue . Keep up the good work. A++++++",

Uninstalled and reinstalled on my Nexus 6P, but nothing. I tried to contact the developer writing a review and have gotten no response after about a month. Google will not give a refund for whatever reason. If this app works on your device, you will probably like it, but it may also simply disappear one day without warning and you are left with nothing.",

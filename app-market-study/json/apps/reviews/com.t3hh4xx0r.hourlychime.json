Specifically, the speed of the \"chimes\" (actually, vibrations).  They're so fast, that it's difficult to count them.  Indeed, sometimes, it feels like one long vibration instead of several distinct ones.  Still, that shouldn't deter one from installing this app.",

Make them long enough to be recognizable, like a bell ring is, or let anyone choose their length. Also, let us choose a chime for the half-hour too, please.",

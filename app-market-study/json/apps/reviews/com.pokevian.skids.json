Overheating while black box and sometimes running in background and draining battery is also problem for me too,",

My point is, make it save that data within the video file itself and not a separated file. If this happens, you might very well have created the best dash cam / black box app available for Android. Seriously think about it and if available on the next update I will change my review to a 5 stars.",

When I try to run the app, it opens to the start up screen with the \"FREE\" version clearly displayed, but within a half second or so the app displays a pop up which reads \"Evaluation period has expired\" then the app closes. I'd lime to evaluate the app to consider purchasing.",

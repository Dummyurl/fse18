When I asked to speak to someone else he claimed to be the only person there and for me to call back tomorrow to talk to an English speaking person. Why do they sell an English version but no English tech support?  The Software work ok when combined with Malwarebytes. Tech support is a 3 ring circus!",

But the free version is really great, too. One of my favorite features that not every antivirus has is the privacy auditor. Sure, you can check app permissions individually, but the privacy auditor tells you with one glance if any are sketchy. Such a light antivirus, too! It's not bogged down with bloatware. The only reason why I remember it's there is because it makes me feel safer. I've had zero problems using Panda. It's a really good brand. Oh! And one more, small thing: I love how it tells you that it's a wonderful day! Such a friendly app, in more ways than one!",

Btw you are to ambitious and greedy in wanting your customers to subcribe for 5 devices and 3years. I had to just change 2phones and swap the email account but your software do not setup to follow according to the google account eventhough say I have paid for my son's account. But after keying the given license I am still stuck to another email eventhough I have paid and extended for both. Boy I cannot wait for product to expires than I moving to another brand. And now I have paid for license that is suppose to work but not even working or able to function properly. When will you help. Till expiration date????",

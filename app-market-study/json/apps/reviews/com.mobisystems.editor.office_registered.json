What a rip since I purchased the Pro version before.  I'm going to stick with my Microsoft Office Apps because they are all free, no advertising, works with my MS OneDrive and all docs are automatically synced and useable on my Windows PC's and other Android devices and it MS Lens is a much better scanner program - better scan quality and has better PDF conversion too. Goodbye MobiSystems, you just lost a paying customer.",

They are no longer for me, and I'll never miss them with your program around. If you ever write this program for PC's, I'll be in line to get it, so long as it maintains local storage and runs locally without the need for phone or internet access. Win10 needs things just like this program. Thanks for the great job with this.... and hope a PC Version comes out to complement this Android program.",

I had this from a past purchase and was dissapointed to find out the fonts were separated from the pro app, and that they were now a separate $10 purchase. I reached out to MobiSystems and they were nice enough to send me a code for a free unlock of the fonts. Now I can keep using this app on my chromebook with all the usual Microsoft Office fonts, great customer service!",

But then again then they included a button of the PREMIUM one where you have to pay almost 20 bucks per year! They have the FREE version, the PRO version which basically just eliminate the ads, and the PREMIUM version where you have an access for their cloud drive. The FREE MICROSOFT WORD app already covers the access of your cloud drive. Again, it's FREE. This app asking you to pay the yearly subscription is a rip-off!",

I had paid for this app and all things were fine till this new update because now even I cannot access those things for which I had paid and so if anybody is here after looking the 0.99$ then go for any other free app. If you want to purchase then I strictly advise you to go for another app like Polaris office which deserves 5 stars and is a editors choice also and for which you should pay but for this app not even a single star whose developers are so illiterate that this app can't even check my credentials for which I had paid and they are thinking that they are Editors choice  Also these people cannot answer the mails which we sent to them.",

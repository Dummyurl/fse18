Needs more explanations of some features, e.g. hydration factor of common drinks and what constitutes warm/cold/hot weather or a very active lifestyle (all of these you can use to modify your daily water goal). And why can you page your water diary into the future if you can't see anything there or at least set up future activities?",

I love how you can set the amount you want to drink for each day and it goes up if the temp outside gets warmer. It also has reminders you can set and the app will remind you to keep drinking so you can reach your goal. You can also customize how many oz are in your bottle or cup. Your weight can play a factor to on how much your goal is. What your supposed to drink a day is half your weight but in ounces so I'm supposed to drink 171 oz a day. I'm really happy I found this app and I think it will help me live a healthier life!",

The interface is great, the widgets are very useful, and I really like the way drinking reminders are handled (popup with options to dismiss, snooze, etc). I like that it takes into account environment, activity levels, and weight.    A few improvements could be made, however. First, I wish the environmental/activity levels were defined (what temperature range is \"hot\", how active is \"active\"?). Also, I would like there to be an option to add extra water for that day. Say you have a cold, in which case you need to drink more water. It would be nice to be able to add an extra glass or two into your requirements without having to tell the app that you are extra active that day or that it's hot outside.  Overall good app. Very helpful to me.",

I used WaterMinder on iOS before and the hydration factor is set by default for some drink types by the developer. That I liked very much, because I didn't have to set it myself. Secondly, the dialog telling me to give a rating to this app is kind of annoying, since it pops up every time I add a drink. Otherwise, thanks for taking my suggestions into consideration and keep up the good work.",

There is also the fact I have no clue how hydrating coffee creamer or the occasional soda, wine, or beer is. If it could automatically account for other drinks hydration or dehydration that would be awesome! All in all I really just needed a reminder to drink more water and this it does well.",

BUT! when I went back into coach to record another glass (total 3) in Samsung health it would add 3 cups to the 2 equalling 5!!! Sooooo annoying. Anyone else get this error?",

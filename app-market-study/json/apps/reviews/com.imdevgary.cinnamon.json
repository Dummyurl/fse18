Due to lack of expressed wants from customers and improvements from that one, we moved to this app. Cinnamon is very impressive. Highly customizable and has many of the features we were looking for.  Only thing I would like to see in the future builds would be a user guide within that features tips on ease of use.  A web browser interface option for our account would be awesome too.  Well done to the developer.",

The app is simple and the design is clean; it has a substantial wealth of features but does not feel too complicated for daily use. My lists consistently sync from my phone to my watch, so I don't have to worry about forgetting items due to lag.The reasons I gave it four stars instead of five are that the Wear app is a little buggy (it switches lists after screen timeout), and I wish there were a few more options for customizing the aesthetic (even just the ability to change the list background to colors other than Light/Dark would be sufficient).",

We buy some items every week. Now I don't have to think about those items individually, just add the bundle to my shopping list with one swipe. I can even adjust categories for the grocery store I use so that my list is sorted by the sections of the store, and I get everything I need before moving on. No back tracking- hooray! That part does take some time to set up on your own, but worth it. I'm still using the free version, but am considering premium to remove ads soon.",

Please add the option to make it so when we put an item in the cart list, when we search for an item and that item has a few letters of it, please make it so it shows that that item is in the cart list. For example, searching for \"juice\" will bring up apple, lemon, and fruit juice for me, and if apple juice was in my cart list, that'd be really helpful if it showed underneath it that it was in my cart, maybe add an icon or something too. 4.

Great design, paying to get rid of the ads is clearly worth it!",

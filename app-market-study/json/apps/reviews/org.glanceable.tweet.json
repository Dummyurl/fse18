And a \"show only the most recent 20/40/50/etc tweets\" function would be cool as well.   when I see \"246 unread tweets\" I just dismiss it since I know there's no way I'm scrolling through all that.",

And maybe consider using profile pictures for the backgrounds when swiping through. But really those are just small tweaks, you've got a really good app here overall!",

A few features that would really help: - An option to disable/enable notifications. I don't always want my watch vibrating to alert me of new tweets throughout the day. There are only particular times I will likely want to use this and the constant vibrates for new tweets throughout the day is a bit annoying. - Some way to fetch the latest tweets. Not sure if this is done in the background, but would be nice if this could be triggered via wear. - Some way to favorite tweets for later. Sometimes there are links/videos I'll want to watch on my phone. Would be nice if that could be done via this app.",

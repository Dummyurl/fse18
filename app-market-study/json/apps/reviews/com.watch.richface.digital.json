        "comment": "Works fine and loving it. However still waiting for the \"interactive\" part to work. Mahalo nui! *FYI - Someone posted \"ORTE\" being read on their watch face but I'm seeing it as \"DATE\". *Update ***** Interactive screen works Terrific! 3/1, 3/12, ***4/30/2016 Still, since last update 'compass' doesn't rotate (animation) anymore. Any answers/suggestions? Cause this was my favorite watch face until the 'compass' no longer worked since 3/1. When 'compass' is checked it's in a frozen state so yeah. 02/16/2017 Compass in a frozen state. Any fixes for it? 05/07/17 If it doesn't work just let me know, what is so hard to reply?",

Even the Update Now button in the wear app won't change the temp from 80 and raining.  Update, had to factory rest my phone today, and now this watchface will not show up in the wear app, making it a pain to configure. Still looks great, but poor functionality.",

Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the weather complication keeps getting stuck since updating to AW 2.0, I have to launch the app on my phone and force and update, it will then keep updating for a couple of hours before it stops again.",

It's a shame but I'll be looking for another app - one that offers more transparency on what they're offering. Tricking users isn't a great way to create loyalty.",

        "comment": "I love the add free version. I  use this app everyday.  I don't care if there are or are not many recipes as some reviews have written about. This app is the best thing ever for clipping recipes off the internet. I use it while watching cooking shows on TV. I also add my own personal recipes. I even add recipes, for my own personal use, by taking a picture of a recipe out of my cookbook.  I love how I can add photos to the recipes, the app allows more than one picture to be added, several, in fact, useful for any new technique in a recipe you are trying to master.  This feature is also  helpful for photographing those old, fading, hand written recipes from your great grandma, grandma, mom. And the best part of the adding photo feature is once you save the recipe with the pictures, you can safely delete the pictures off your device. Plus you can back up all your recipes in multiple formats which are friendly across all my devices, even viewable, in a limited way, on my pc! I don't subscribe to the service that allows me to have access to all my recipes across all my devices because I prefer to have my recipes under my control. If I lose my recipes it is my own fault and no one else's. Therefore I end up backing up frequently and make those back ups available via the cloud or personal server to any device in case of an emergency. Frankly, my back up is huge and I have a dedicated tablet just for this app. I don't want to crowd my phone with it. You can selectively back up only certain recipes for traveling and shopping on your phone. I would gladly pay more for a way to do searches by tags and catagory, but that limit might be of my own making and I have yet to fully understand the search feature. Certain features are not available unless you have a monthly subscription. I can deal with that, because even with that limitation this is simply the best app of its kind out there and well worth more than it's price.",

        "comment": "Been using MyCookbookPro for a month and a half for frequent home cooking.  The recipe importer Just Works in terms of ingredient accuracy for all the food blogs I frequent.  Adding recipes to a shopping list is easy and saves me at least 20 minutes every few days. This bit of functionality is certainly useful, but almost every other interaction with this app is clunky.  Ingredients and directions are stripped of context. For recipes with multiple parts (a sauce, different glazes), it's impossible to tell how much of an ingredient to add if it is listed multiple times. For example, if the Directions say \"add the salt\" in three different places, and there are three different amounts of salt listed in Ingredients.  This makes a huge chunk of the app (including the nice Ingredients/Directions horizontal split) unusable for most recipes I cook.  I always end up back at the site I imported the recipe from to figure out correct amounts for each part of the recipe.  Shopping lists reverts back to nothing checked if you leave them. If you accidentally click out in the middle of a trip, or pre check off ingredients you already have from a list you exported from a recipe and try to come back to it later, you start back at nothing checked. Deleting items is the way to go, but it's a tiny button and sort of a PITA to get to the edit menu for a list.  You can easily scale a recipe (super handy) but can't pin the scale. This means for the typical usage of scaling a recipe, adding it to a shopping list, and cooking it at a later time, you have to remember the exact scale you set it for your shopping list, or risk not having enough ingredients.  The Meal Planner view is only available after you create a premium account online. Weird, I thought I was getting the pro version here?  You can't add one of your recipes in the view itself, which is unintuitive and frustrating.  I respect what they've accomplished, but this app leaves a lot to be desired in overall ease of use.",

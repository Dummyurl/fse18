The watch face uses two different shades of yellow/gold that look terrible together and there is no option for 24 hour time or much customization for a paid app.  Don't buy this face until it is optimized.  Also, as a side note, the English directions and prompts in the settings are hilariously erroneous.  On a Huawei 2 and TH Connected watches, I haven't observed any crashes or instabilities like others have noticed.",

I bought it with hopes in getting more features, they're great once permissions are enabled within the watch. However, it needs to be customized further, the minutes hands in ambient need to be as same as the preset selected, and further features such as longer timeout on full face to ambient mode could be welcome. Just a bit more work, straight forward info and this can be a gem to be had. Keep up the good work. Honest.",

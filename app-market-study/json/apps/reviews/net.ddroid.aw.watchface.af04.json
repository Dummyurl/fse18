However I can't give it (or any available face) a 5 (loved it), as, in this case, the sunrise/set times seem to be in something like a 5 point font, even on the larger-size version of the Zenwatch 2. If the circle devoted to sunrise/set on this watch, and other faces designed by the same group, were made into a square and the graphic semicircle and redundant \"until\" time to the next event were removed, there'd be room to use a larger font for the sunrise/set times, and even include moonrise/set times in that larger font. Then I could love it.----------------- Revised view: The recently updated Soluna face has replaced F04 as my main choice. Its sunrise/set times are legible, and now that it has 12-hour time, has won me over. The not-too-accurate outdoor temperature readings don't add too much to F04's functionality.",

        "comment": "Great watch face. Very easy to see with certain backgrounds, like Topaz. I like the ambient mode too. Doesn't seem to eat battery life with my Asus Zen watch. I have to add something however: when I first got the watch, I installed lots of things (app lover!) including this item, and the battery was dropping a percent a minute. It was going dead in barely five hours. I don't know what app was doing it. The watch updated Android several times after setting it up, (a-la Microsoft updates on a brand new computer... endless update, update, update) so I just factory reset it, and let it all sync again. (You have to \"forget this watch\" to get it all back, and go thru all the welcome crap again) After that, it will drop to about 60% by the time I get home at the end of the day - a nice gentle ramp on the battery graph. For people having battery problems, just factory reset the watch and try again. One thing that drops a star for me though is when I get too far from the phone, the weather and solar items turn into dashes. Maybe make it leave the data there, but grey out a bit or something until it reconnects and updates again. The cloud with slash symbol lets you know you're too far away.",

Only problem is that I would like to have custom letters for the days, right now it's only in english, having possibility to set custom letters for every day would be really great and worth the 5*! (I know the whole interface is in english but I am mostly looking at time and date and day of the week so it would help) ... Also it would be great to have option in the settings to keep the last data on screen when losing connection with the phone (maybe even let us set how long to keep the last data there). If I lose the connection with my phone on five minutes it is bad to see just date and time. And in those 5 minutes the other data visible wouldn't even change so keeping that data there would be great.",

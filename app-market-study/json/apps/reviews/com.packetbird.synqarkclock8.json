Most colors wash into the background. Second, an adjustable screen on time. A couple other watch faces have recently added this, and it is a very nice addition.",

While I think the pulse and second animations look cool, they are a massive strain on the battery. The ability to disable those, not just make them transparent, would be manor boost for the watchface. Being able to resize the text would be helpful as well.",

What's important here is, with the appearance of this face and how it functions it is able to provide very good battery life. After 10 hours I'm usually around 60%. Sure this can vary by usage. I just know I'll be using this one a while.",

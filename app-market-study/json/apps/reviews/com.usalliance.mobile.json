I had the prior version which also was also disfunctional, I deleted it and I am sure the same will happen here. There's also no help menu. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but to no avail. I got the same error message. I'm done ...press delete!",

Consider getting an additional account for mobile deposits with another bank if you often need to make mobile deposits. -- Update: The latest update is better.   I usually have to take just one photo of a check for it to work now.",

Walmart and eBay are so much better! (4) Prime is becoming unworthy as other store prices are just the same without the membership!",

When I try to click \"add to list\" or \"add to cart\" it doesn't always work right away or at all. I end up mashing my finger against the screen only for nothing to happen. I have to close out of the app and reload it sometimes just to click \"add to cart' and it be successful.",

Yes I understand thing u ordered come from China or where ever but to be fare it can get here the next day as I ordered something and it didn't come and I contacted the seller and they sent it again and I got it the very next day interesting really isn't.",

It used to be true that all orders eligible for Prime shipping would mean 2- day delivery, but recently, more and more orders (even those fulfilled and shipped by Amazon) are taking 4 or 5 days for delivery.  Also,  about half of our orders are not even getting delivered to our house,  but instead getting dropped off at the post office,  which has very limited hours (lunchtime only,  when we're at work), so we're having to wait until the weekend before we can even go get our packages. Please,  please stop this,  Amazon! Its completely removing the benefit of online shopping- I'd rather go out and buy a product in store,  and have it right away,  rather than wait a week and a half before reveiving anything,  and then Still having to go drive to pick it up!   Come on, Amazon Prime,  this isn't what you're advertising.",

What part of I'm not interested do you not understand? Walmart offers free two day shipping and their products often cost less. The content is poorly organized with weird mapping between products and categories makes it hard to find things. User reviews and products are often mismatched.

I even searched the internet for the answer to what should be extremely simple, and Amazon's help section (outdated), all the instructions provided did not lead me to an option that allowed me to sign out. I even tried editing my email and password, where it stated that that login information was already in use (duh). Seriously, it's not hard to provide such a simple feature, and this app does not contain the most basic of features. So, yeah, 1 star until this gets changed, and I'll be looking elsewhere for future purchases if this is the behavior i can expect from Amazon. For shame.",

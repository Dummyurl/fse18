But this app makes my phone a device from the future! When I leave home and disconnect from my WiFi, all tasks are run to connect to my Bluetooth car, launches the right traffic apps. When I leave my car, disconnect Bluetooth, enable WiFi, disable screen rotation, etc. Great! Keep it up!",

        "comment": "Have been using this app for 5+ years. At the beginning it was great, but slowly it has become obsolete. No major updates (new features) have been released for a long time. It is easy to use and the UI is great, but it lacks support of a lot of controls that other apps can manage (look at Automate for example.) The big disappointment here is the geo location feature, which has never worked for me. I paid for this application when it was the best out there; today I would put my money somewhere else.",

        "comment": "Sucks. Does anyone actually work on this thing anymore or what!? Get this fixed! Update - For whatever reason, it changes my \"Display Timeout\" to \"after 72 hours of inactivity\" instead of \"30 seconds\" when triggering the iHeartRadio App.  A year or two ago it was fantastic.  Now it does (or doesn't) do whatever it wants. It decides what triggers (and parts of triggers) it feels like triggering, or it changes part of them entirely, regardless of my settings.  Here's hoping it returns to its formerly awesome app soon.  In the event it is phone related (I've uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared cache everyway possible, and factory reset (\ud83d\ude20) my device). I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 on Sprint.  Hopefully that will help.",

The NUMBER. ONE. Item I use this for is to integrate with my calendar to silence during meetings, church, etc. Calendar event starts, phone mutes. Calendar ends- unmute. SIMPLE, right? I got a new phone (note 8). But only for certain calendars; I don't need it to mute for a lunch date, for example. I restored my triggers from the cloud. Slick. __But now it doesn't read individual calendars!!__ So I can silence ALL or silence NONE. Yeah, that don't work for me. I sent an email to the devs, but 4 days later and no response. 1 star until someone at least acknowledges that I sent them an email... or fixes the calendar functionality. On to IFTTT, I guess. :(",

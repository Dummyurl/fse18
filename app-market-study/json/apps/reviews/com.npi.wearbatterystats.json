Otherwise, love the prediction for how much longer you have, although I wish it would also say how long the watch has already been on, or even better an estimate of how much total time you should get while unplugged. With that you can compare days and quickly determine if a new app or setting is significantly impacting battery life. Will return to 5 stars once bug is fixed.",

It's not really that much more useful than the battery info you get in the wear app.  If you're looking for what is causing battery drain, all this seems to tell you is what applications you have installed, not how much battery is being used by each app or process.",

In view of the random battery drain on Android lollipop, how about adding a feature when the app notices a rapid increase in battery use.

I had to wait a long time for it to sync up with the watch.   I've only used it a short while so far, but I do seem to be getting some history.   I just installed this as the latest Android Wear update (11/11/15) seems to have removed the battery stats from the options.   Since I've had problems with the rapid battery drain, I want to keep an eye on the battery to see if it recurs before the battery drains to zero.  We'll see if this app actually replaces the battery display in android wear.",

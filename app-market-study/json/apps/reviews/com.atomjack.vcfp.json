I now have it on my Note 8, and haven't seen any trouble with it at all, it works very well, finding and doing whatever I ask it to. I want to show this off to friends/family this holiday season, I'm pretty sure they will be impressed. I've gotten 2 others into Plex, perhaps they will like this as well!",

        "comment": "This app is really great, thanks Dev. Would love to see wear support. Plus anyway around not having to root to integrate it into google now (probably not possible). Keep it up! Thanks a lot for developing this. Much cheaper than an xbox1 EDIT: Totally works in google now with tasker & auto voice unrooted!",

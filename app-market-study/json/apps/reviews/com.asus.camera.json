I would give it 5 stars if it were better at resolving hand shake, I've found I need to be very steady to get a sharp picture. Knowing that, I set it to a 2 second delay. Inclusion of a 'straightening' feature to the already fairly complete editing tools is nicely done.  Overall, I've become an Asus fan.",

But it's too hard to get timer when most needed and also it's such a nasty experience to miss a shot because of it. I often forget that camera is in timer mode after a night shot, and hence miss the shot in day time. PLEASE MAKE THE TIMER A SEPARATE EASY TO ACCESS BUTTON. Else lots of people who are serious about ZenFone photography are going to face this issue.",

BUT, I think the HDR photo I like the old version for ASUS pasfone infinity(I had this phone for 2 years, and it was the best HDR camera app for me) But this New version of HDR Pro I like it less, because the colour is less vivid, it only makes the photo brighter, but not colourful. You can see my profile photo, that was taken by my asus padfone infinity and it's old version app, it's colourful but very natural. But this new HDR pro does not make the same effect, it just adjust the darker place brighter. I really hope this app for zenfone3 could do the same as padfone infinity. Thank you very much Asus.  Written from my third asus smartphone, a true fan of yours._______________________________________________ Actually, after trying for a while taking different photos with normal mode and HDR PRO mode, I don't see any difference!? I don't think the HDR pro mode is working properly!!! Why? Please fix this!",

The image in the viewfinder is lag behind around 1 second than what it is in the real life so it's really annoying. And the lag is getting worse after I capture some pictures. I'm using ZE551ML 2GB variant which I think is certainly capable of running this app to its fullest feature so I suspect that this is a bug from the app.",

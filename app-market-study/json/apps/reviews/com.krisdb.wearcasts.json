I was so excited to finally have a podcast program for Android Wear! Hoping they fix this soon.  Well happy to report I heard from the publisher again and he seems to have fixed the issue with the latest update (uploaded today). I loaded, the app launched and I was able to download a podcast and begin listening. Hope to go for a run later today and put it through the real trial.   But I appreciate the quick response! As I mentioned, I have been hoping for an app like this since Android Wear launched!",

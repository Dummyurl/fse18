While the setup sure is complicated to understand, I was however able to change next/previous pages in a PDF file (viewed from phone, casted to Chromecast) from my LG G Watch Urbane in latest January Marshmallow update. This app saves me the trouble and the time to converting pdf files to pptx because my teachers in university refuse to give their slides in pptx for some reason. Awesome work dev!",

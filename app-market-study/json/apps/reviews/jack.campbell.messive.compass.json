        "comment": "These seem unable to play nice.  Which ever gets access first works - but then fails once the other tries to access the compass - at which point the working one also fails.  Symptoms - inaccurate reading in second app, then freezing in first app.  I assume one or both apps are attempting to open sensors exclusively - which would seem weird for a read only operation.  This is an app. issue, not hardware as the sensor carries on reporting movement just fine.  App is basic, but fine.  Update: I am not sure the statement that only one app can get sensor data is correct (may depend on how you are getting the data) as I have two apps gathering step data successfully, also using SensorDashboard (an app) it reports all sensors while they are being used by the other apps.",

The description doesn't say that, as other apps of this kind do, and it is shown on a Moto 360 which may be a first gen device.   Put in the disclaimer and take out the picture of the app working on the Moto 360 and I will change the rating.   Also, it seems to work on the phone, but jut has one screen and no way to calibrate it or do anything other than turn it on and off.",

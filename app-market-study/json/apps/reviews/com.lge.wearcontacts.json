I was an early adopter of LG G Watch R, which is still new and now no support by you (No Apps and no WiFi) although it has the same hardware as your Urbane watch. Believe me if it was not Google who still support us by updating Android Wear, we must have been left alone for along time by you. The most important factor in consumer market is after sale support, which you clearly lack. Sorry LG.",

If you have trouble seeing your contacts on the watch update your google plus contacts and mark them with the star. That should make them visisble on your watch. Add the speaker app to active your phone speaker on incoming calls. Handy if you are driving without a headset and phone is out of reach. Similar to car blue tooth sync to phone.",

        "comment": "First off I own you an apology, this app is not locked only to the Urbane, it simply requires the 5.1.1 software on the watch.  I would suggest that mentioning that requirement, rather than calling out the Urbane specifically might have gone some way to avoiding mine and others confusion and resultant anger.  I included the 'ish' because I'm still holding on to a healthy dose of anger as a result of your decision not to get the FCC to approve the GWR for wifi, despite fully working chip/antenna. Still smacks of trying to force users to upgrade.",

If the issue of not supporting the G Watch and GWR is that the app requires Android Wear 5.1.1 please just tell us instead of leaving us in the dark and assuming that you are no longer supporting your first two Android Wear devices. If the reason you are not supporting the GW and GWR is that you are trying to drive sales of the Urbane then that is despicable  and you have lost a customer.",

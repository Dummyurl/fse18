        "comment": "It looks nice - the location is often a good bit off (could be location services, not the widget), but my main complaint is that the options for 9/12/15 hours don't work.  You only get the 6hr forecast.  Also, sometimes, it just says \"waiting for location\" for hours on end...  EDIT: Updated to 5 stars.  I swapped out watch faces, brought this one back, and now I have the full 15 hours of weather.  On top of that, I appreciate the dev's personal reply.  This is by far the nicest looking watchface with weather in my opinion.",

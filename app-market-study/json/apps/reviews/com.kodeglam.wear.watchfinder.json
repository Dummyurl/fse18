The sound is loud and the volume cannot be adjusted. The \"don't again\" button doesn't work half the time. It would be nice if there are options for the volume of the alarm.",

Alarm keep going off every several minutes while I'm at work, I don't know if it because it got disconnected or what but it's annoying, I uninstalled the app so I can still keep my job. Will install it again once it got better.",

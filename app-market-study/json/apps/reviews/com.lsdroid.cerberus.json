However, there is a critical flaw... everyone whose device is registered under the same account has to use the same login credentials. And anyone on the account can see where everyone else is, at any given time. There is NO WAY our adult kids will sign onto this, knowing that Mom & Dad could log in and know their whereabouts 24/7!  I contacted the company and let them know that this is a show-stopper for us; that they need to add users by EMAIL ADDRESS and then by their unique DEVICES. That way, everyone would have their own login credentials. Until that happens, though, Cerberus and Persona are not under consideration for us.",

I have never had a phone stolen but I appreciate the fact that If it ever happens I can track it, back up all my files remotely, and then brick it so the thief can't use it or get any of my info from it. Many thanks to the Developers for such a great app \ud83d\ude00",

I've never did have my phone stolen, but should it have happened, Cerberus would've been my best option. But on principle, I refuse to use it. How can anyone trust the developer on any terms after this?",

        "comment": "Hello There. I am is one of the early users and purchased a lifetime license for the Anti-theft app. I got an  email informing me about  a new released app: Cerberus Personal Safety (Persona). Following phase was also found on this email \" we appreciate it and of course we will honor the terms of that license\".  Two links were embedded in this email. Following these links, I was leaded to a webpage  asking for my credit card number to pay for this upgrade (First  year free! then 22.50/year).  Please let me know if \"upgrade\" is needed in order for me  to continue using this app.  If upgrade is needed, why I have to  pay the  2nd time for an  app that was  paid a lifetime license.  Looking forward to hearing from you.  David P.",

This app is much more full proof than any other program out there. It's impossible to delete and undetectable if the program is hidden. I give it 10 stars.",

        "comment": "Works great when you don't now it's there. However, in the last few weeks, it keeps giving a \"device located\" notification that can't be swiped away-you have to restart the phone. Not ideal when you want it to be invisible to a thief's eyes. Would have been 5 stars otherwise.  Edit: won't let me unauthorized the app as an device administrator. Won't let me delete the app. This has just become bad news - avoid until it's fixed",

Google didn't understand at all what this app is about. Why do they not include a notification in all their apps that track us all constantly. Bit unfair and bullyish. Thanks Cerberus for your app. It is better than ever, stay strong.",

They control what you can do with the app which I find very disappointing, also my phone now says \"device located\" so I believe someone may of hacked my account and is tracing my phone or cerberus is.   Poor customer service so it's time to remove this app and find something better.",

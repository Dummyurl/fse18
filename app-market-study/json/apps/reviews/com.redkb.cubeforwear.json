The only couple things i don't like about it is that when you buy the 3x3, you have to pay to get rid of the adds all together. I think you should make a button that says: buy 3x3+remove adds, for a discount off of the total price. Like from $2.00 to $1.50. Also it only has the 2x2 and 3x3, try adding the 1x1 and the 4x4. Its too bad you can only see one side at a time. You should also add a option so people can make their own logo's and put it on their cube. You should add a few more puzzles too, like the void cube. Just a few pointers. :3",

You will always run into issues trying to display and control a three dimensional moving cube on a two dimensional screen.  This gets even harder when trying to do it on a screen as small as a smart watch.  Kenneth did a great job with what he had.  I do think however due to the presentation of the cube that is app is for pros only, and only worth it if you have a watch",

        "comment": "Terrible.  You're limited to viewing one face of the cube at a time, so a) your solves will be riddled with cube rotations and b) you can't do F or B moves at all. To turn the layers you have to gesture on a very specific part of the cube, otherwise it'll either rotate the entire cube, or it won't do anything at all. And vice versa for doing cube rotations, 70% of the time I found myself turning layers when I wanted to rotate the entire cube.  The app is locked to only the 2x2 cube, and you have to pay just over a dollar to be able to use the 3x3 cube. No other size options are available. I bought the 3x3 unlock to see what it does, and was surprised to find that this didn't remove ads. You also have to spend an extra dollar to remove the ads. Really?  Scrambles aren't random state, and must be limited to a certain number of moves or something because all optimal solutions for my 3x3 scrambles were over 18 moves HTM, which means that more than a quarter of all possible scrambles won't be generated at all. The timer only starts when a move is made on the cube, not a rotation, so you have unlimited inspection time, so generating an optimal solution for every state is possible.",

Controls are intuitive although they might need some fine tuning, like middle slice and full cube rotations are a bit dodgy.  The on-screen ads are not annoying for me, no popup ads spotted. Totally worth my 99 cents. Few complaints to be made, but no big ones, these are some annoying bits of the app;   I wish the cubes would be displayed bigger on my android phone, using the entire width of my screen; The back button while on the menu should bring me back to the cube instead of closing the app; On the results screen, redundant moves (like [x' x x] or [x x x]) should be replaced with their shortest form, so it is easier to review the solution.  Got a suggestion or two for improving it, these are little gimmicky things that aren't necessary but would make the app better in my opinion; Sound, i want to be able to hear those distinctive sounds, and a bluetooth/wifi race mode, where all connected devices are given the same scramble, and inspection time is not ignored.",

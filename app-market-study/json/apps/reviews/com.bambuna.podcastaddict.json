        "comment": "This is a great podcasting application, the best I've found. My only criticism is that I can't find the \"New Podcasts\" or \"Downloaded Podcasts\" pages. Periodically when the app syncs it gives me two notifications one about X number of new podcasts, another about Y number of downloaded podcasts. Clicking on those notifications brings me to a nice screen with those new items displayed. If I accidentally close the app, or silence the notification I have no way of returning to those screens until I receive another notification (the next time one of my podcasts publishes new content). Please, if you could, add links to those pages so they can be visited on demand, instead of simply through the notifications.  Edit: Based on you're comment I've given this a 5 star. I have to say this is exactly why I love this application. Everything is configurable!!! Also, amazing support, thanks for your help!",

I live in the woods and I'm slowly starving to death, but it doesn't matter because I have this app, and it's the closest approximation of God that mankind has ever discovered.

If there's a way to listen to episodes from oldest to newest I haven't been able to find out how to do it. From a technical standpoint at least Podcast Addict allows RSS feeds and doesn't constantly lose my place in lengthy episodes.

On the note of rewinding or selecting different times, you will select, say 24:45 and it will just put you 10-15 mins ahead of where you click. Very frustrating.",

So to get to my 205 weight i used it would've taken forever to get to 205. I saw on another machine it went by 25 increments. Just small bugs but overall helpful and organized. I would like to see a trainers version to track workouts with clients especially when they have cardio to do on off days.",

It would be great to be able to enter pounds or kilograms because the equipment is in kg and the freeweights are in lbs. The app has been crashing a ton for me lately since the most recent update whenever doing a save of a manual log.   One of my biggest problems is it isn't intuitive, its actually confusing to use unless you want to put time into figuring it out, this may sway other users from ever even touching the app.  The app has a ton going for, and I really want to get behind it, but it needs polish.",

And if I wanted to try at the end of the workout to scan my workout it just simply won't scan the HUGE scannable icon. I do not recommend this app. It's beyond frustrating. I gave it 2 stars because the idea is good however the functionality is horrible.",

Other than that I love this little app mainly because it sticks to doing just what it needs to and does it well  Following the latest update not only does it mandate having location services but now wants access to camera, funnily enough I don't want to take pictures when I am in the gym. Plus several times after a treadmill workout it has failed to appear on my account so it looks like quality is going downhill",

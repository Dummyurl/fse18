        "comment": "As a teacher this is invaluable. I always know exactly how long I have till class ends. It is perfect for making sure I get exit slips out in time and get cleanup taken care of. The developer responds quickly (Thank you) and I was able to find my notifications had been blocked on my watch somehow. If the watch could vibrate with the alerts like the phone at the time left that would be fantastic. Or if you could make a new schedule based off your old one easier for those odd days. Would make the app fantastic.  This app is a must have for Teachers, and I have recommended it to several already. Thanks again!",

Then open that timetable and select Class Time. Opening always creates a new copy, so you will have two copies in the app. You can then edit the copy as you wish. Hope that helps.",

At the beginning of every term, I can see everyone checking their schedules online or writing them down in their notebooks, trying to find what class they have and where. I, on the other hand, just check my smartwatch.   Class Time's watch face tells you what class you have, where, what your next class is, and how much time you have left until the lecture/break ends. This app is currently dictating my next smartwatch purchase as it is currently only available on Android Wear.  There are plenty of settings to mess around with, from auto-muting, to vibration patterns that notify you of how much time you have left. Honestly, this app can be used as a day organizer or for a workout schedule.  The only thing I could wish for is the ability to copy lessons and paste them wherever I wish. Currently, you have to be smart about the way you add classes so that you can use the 'copy day' feature as a shortcut.",

It's completely out of the way when I have no use for it and right where it's needed when I do. There are a few minor UI issues but nothing more than occasional annoyances that can be worked around. Importing classes directly from Google Calendar (where I already had them stored) was flawless and only took a few seconds. A glorious job by Nohus.",

It is also very sleek looking in its design. I would only change 3 things:  1) Allow more customization of alerts, such as alert times & having a bell ring (two of my schools don't have bells, so I rely on this app to tell me the period is ending/beginning), 2) alphabetize the timetable list, and 3) remove the \"in\" from the \"Next\" bar.

And I thing its dumb that you have to pay for colors. It's very useful for when you're arranging a schedule .to tell you the truth be told didn\u2019t really need this because I got google calendar to do the same thing but my teacher said we had to use it. They had very similar ways between the two apps too. But I do like that you can donate a bus ticket or a small pizza and a movie ticket I don't know what its goes to but and the bottom it say 'google takes 30% of every donation and purchases.

Considering I have the latest top of the range Sony Xperia XZ Premium (although it does not work on the Sony Xperia Z5 either) I wonder how it works at all on lesser spec'd machines.  UPDATE : Having got a reply from the developers today I looked at the app again on my phone, (the above problem was on the phone app) and for some reason (magic ?) it is working perfectly, so I then turned to my Sony Smartwatch 3 (it doesn't run Wear v2 by the way) and it works perfectly on that too.  I must admit I had not checked or used it since I first reported the problem, but all is well now and of course I have now given it the 5 stars it deserves. Thanks to the developer for the reply though - I do feel a little guilty for not checking it before now though although there has been no updates to Aeris, there have been a couple of Android updates, but it still remains a mystery as to why it didn't work initially.",

The icons could be a tiny bit bigger when displayed on the watch in week view and Celsius displayed with mph for UK dwellers would be a helpful addition, but these are minor points. Overall this is a smashing little weather app.",

Also, the Pro version only changes the cards and the card order on the watch notifications. You can't change the order of the cards as they appear in the watch app itself.",

So unbalanced on the options for users in the store. It is realized that this app is primarily focused for Android wear but again it seems like enough thought and time went into the actual phone app, why not add the updatable widget?",

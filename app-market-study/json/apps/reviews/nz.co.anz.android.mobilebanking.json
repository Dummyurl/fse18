I have seen people on IPhone having the ability to do so but not samsung. I also know for a fact you can screenshot on other banks apps. Please rectify this security feature in your next update it has really been irritating for so long now. Once you have I will change my review. Cheers.",

Can't take screenshots shots, yes I know it's security reasons, end of the day it's my phone, my money and you shouldn't dictate what I can or can't do with it. Oh FYI simple free screen recorder app bypasses your no screen shot policy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. So if you worried about apps stealing information, a good scammers app will secretly screen record and you no screen shot policy can't do anything about it.  2. Finger print login doesn't work.  3. Widget is just as useless, 99% of the time its saying no internet connection.  4. And to simply login to check account balance takes almost a minute. It probably will be easier to walk to an ATM. And I am talking on fiber connection using Note8  Bank makes millions of dollars in profit but can't get simple things right in a app and fails to think about screen recorder scammers, time for new security team.",

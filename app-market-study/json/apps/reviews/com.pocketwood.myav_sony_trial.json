Set up different profiles for different rooms. My whole house can now be controlled from my phone. The only way it could be better if it had an xbox one remote too, but hey ho can't win them all. Only gripe is volume has just suddenly stopped working. Don't know if due to a recent update as I have auto updates. Going to uninstall and see if that fixes. Also nit picking. Make your menus look a bit prettier. It looks unfinished.",

I was so happy that I went ahead and purchased the app after the trial period ended. However, after purchasing the app, it is not working at all. I haven't changed anything and it continues to say there are \"no devices found\" and there is a problem with my router. I am having no trouble whatsoever connecting my phone and my laptop to my internet and even after rebooting my router several times, I have not been able to successfully use this app. Needless to say, I am very disappointed and would like to request a refund for purchasing the full version that is clearly not the same as the trial version.",

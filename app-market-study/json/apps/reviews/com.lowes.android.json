        "comment": "Store map gone and store location feature more difficult to find but I found it!  1. Menu icon in upper left 2. My account  3. My Lowe's list 4. App quick list  ~Finally~ Ta Da!! The list with the aisle and bay number. Not always accurate but it's a place to start.  However still NO STORE MAP!  Lowe's is not the kind of place I go for a leisurely stroll.  I'm usually grabbing what I need quickly. I need app features to be convenient.  Much less helpful with out the map. Nice that the My Lowe's code is easy to access but not really sure what it does since I've been told by employees that I still need a receipt for returns and I'm not earning points or anything when I use it. So is it just a list of my purchases?",

I've also encountered an annoying bug. Tried to order online via the app and the checkout button does not actually check out. No errors given. Just says \"verifying address\" then returns to the payment input page.",

I'm not buying things made in China for a lot of reasons, yet I have to go to the store to physically look at the boxes to identify which items create jobs here in the USA & which have been offshored. Please fix the app. I'm trying to buy from your store, & yet you aren't making it easy.",

Unfortunately it doesn't do that. So I had to wait a while more until I could find an employee that wasn't too busy to help. He even said it was stupid that feature wasn't on there or the website. I appreciated him looking it up and even went with me to find it.",

Sometimes accurate info & inventory (mostly, for my local store). Problems: Quick List: Not shared between devices, separate from all other lists. Moving & sorting to other lists a pain. Cart: Slow to load & inferior to lists. (Don't use cart until ready to purchase, use lists.) Notifications: Constant alerts for price changes of items in Quick List, with no setting to turn off! (Unforgivable. Block entire app from notifications in Android settings! Thanks, Google.)",

It's great for looking up specific items I want and finding where they are at whatever store I'm shopping at. I can also access my lists of products that I added from both my phone as well as my computer at home and see how many are in stock. The app makes shopping so much more efficient and enjoyable at Lowes. And it even displays the barcode for my Lowe's account so that at checkout it can be scanned and my purchases can be saved to my Lowe's account.",

Still gets you in the area if what you are searching for. More room for saved items would be great. Why such a short list? Are you aware how many items are in these stores???",

For the last two months anything I have looked for has NOT been where the App says it is supposed to be. I looked for a switch (12V lighted) that I had checked about resupply. Supposed to be in Isle X Bin YY.  Nope? I found it TWO weeks later in a completely different location.  App still said it was still in the other location.  Paid triple to fix and finish my project. Today I looked for an Automatic Center Punch (Isle xx Bay y) 5 in stock. Not even a spot for it there. None to be found. No one working can locate it on the shelf. Because all the \"Experts\" have been released, demoted and fired no one know anything any more. It was nice to go and ask a question and get a real answer. Not a guess at how it might work.  Nice work goofing up the App (inventory data?) and the workers Lowe's. Uninstalled.  Its useless....",

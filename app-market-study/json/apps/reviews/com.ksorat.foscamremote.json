I have to force stop the app daily because it isn't responding or the speaker takes over a minute to come on, if it comes on at all. The app is ok but it requires patience.",

Keep in mind that \"buggy\" and \"in a place with a low wi-fi signal\" are 2 different things. Low signals make the controls jumpy, just the nature of the beast. My only complaint is the audio lag. It increases over time and is easily reset by toggling speaker on and off, but overnight can be off by about 10 seconds. Love seeing the camera feed on my watch!",

This app was extremely easy to setup, and the connection the the camera was fast and responsive, even on a slower network like a 3G network.   The user interface is clean and intuitive. I really like the virtual joystick for controlling pan/tilt, none of other apps I tried have that nifty feature.  This is app is so awesome and easy to use that made the in-app purchase to get rid of the ads, and support the developer, within 10 minutes of setting up all my cameras. Totally worth $3.

It automatically takes the picture as soon as it detects a check when your scanning it so half the time the picture is blurry as I'm trying to get the check in view.

I haven't received any updates for the app and I've had it for over 7 months now. I travel a lot so the mobile deposits are convenient for me and if the pictures of the checks turn out blurry, I can retake the picture and it's usually fine.

(previous-Working fine until update, now it crashes every time I submit the check images for a deposit. Apparently the deposit goes through because it hits my account, but the app closes.)",

Now you have blanks screens (no options in the field), account 'lockouts' (when the correct information is put in) & all the other troubles people are having here. The check via camera deposits are magnificent when it works.  No need to tell me to call the hotline (which is useless on weekends when somebody actually needs it)- my stepdad works for you.  Just a healthy heads up from us newer Samsung note people.  EDIT 2.7.17  Still having random problems with the camera deposits. Overall, the other issues have been seemly settled. Good job",

In addition, most annoyingly it makes it difficult to log into one's account: one is supposed to tap on an icon labeled EDIT, on the top right - but, on phones, as opposed to phablets and tablets, that icon can be seen only when the phone is held in landscape position. This is very poor design.  A GUI so poorly designed does not make me confident about other, more complex chores, that the app is supposed to tackle. I will definitely stay with the official app. Actually, the more I look into this app, the worse it is. After logging into my account, it just offers some generic settings, rather than my specific ones, as the official app can do. This app is eye candy and nothing else.",

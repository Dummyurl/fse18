Although I still have some memory issues on my older phone (sometimes the cast list don't display or update as they should) but my main issue is that it is a little too easy to accidentally change what is playing if I am listening while scrolling and managing my lists.",

It's the least clunky, but there's still some very unnecessary steps in using the app. The most frustrating part is the large episode window that takes up 20% of the screen even when an episode isn't playing and/or has been deleted.",

When I start listening from NOT the oldest the app doesn't 'follow my lead' and go to the \"logical\" next in sequence. It jumps back to the oldest in the list. So I can't let it stream episode to episode from my chosen point. I have to end each podcast and then manually select the next one I want to listen to.

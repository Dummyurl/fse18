I much prefer the touch controls, however if you accidentally partially drag the screen while trying to input a direction it then thinks that you're holding the direction, and the only way to fix it is to start from the last save. I'd also like to see more customisation over the controls- even having faint outlines where the buttons are would be very helpful. Destroys battery too...",

It would be cool if there was an option for a simple mask to help me see the borders of each button. Even a simple transparent 3x3 grid would be perfect. All in all, its worth the money IMO!                       PS:  where the directional button sticks when you accidentally swipe....just press the directional button that is stuck and an t will reset.",

The tilt controls toggle doesn't work. And as a side note, maybe an NES wrist emulator app, and Gameboy Advance wrist emulator (with a frameskip option). I seriously recommend this app and love it.

Luckily you can turn off tilt controls and use touch input for directions as well (the 2x2 control grid pictured above becomes a 3x3 grid with directions added). My one suggestion would be to add sound (my ZenWatch 2 has a speaker and other watches can use Bluetooth headsets)",

Both original GB games seem to have severe color (greyscale) pallette issues with grey appearing as black, making some screens unreadable. The tilt controls are also a bit difficult to work with (would prefer to be able to replace Start/Select with left/right, and use motion gestures for down/up, for example). Also, if a notification comes in during play, it freezes the game - but thanks to save states, nothing lost.",

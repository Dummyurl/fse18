There are a few bugs where after looking at a notificationl it doesn't display the correct time and mode for passive mode, this is fixed by going into active mode and letting it transition back into passive mode, hope they will iron that out though. Also, wish I could remove the spin transition hand and just have the second hand fade in in active mode. Favorite watch face thus far though.",

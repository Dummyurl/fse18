However, I feel that the app needs a lot of work. I often can't pause music, or unpause it, without it glitching. Also, there are a lot of limits in the app as compared to the full site. For example, I would like to be able to add play lists to my collection in the app, or search specific users or terms. Overall though, it works well enough, and I'm satisfied.",

I was surprised this morning to find my music was capped to 30 minutes a week unless I upgrade. I was alright with their addition to ads because hey, we all gotta make money. So now I'm switching to another free streaming service.",

Then they cut those listening limits down like crazy - most people I know only have about 45 mins of listening per week, now.   It's a godd*mn shame, because 8tracks used to be the best streaming service out there, with a vibrant and creative userbase. Now...just go subscribe to Spotify, it's the only playlist service worth having anymore. RIP 8tracks, you got greedy.",

But the fact of the matter is, you don't get money out of supporters by reducing what they can do without cash. That is how you drive out a fanbase. I was even considering getting a plus account until you decided to shove limits down our throats...and only an hour of streaming a week? Come on, I did that in a night. I think I'll take my playlists elsewhere.",

Now I can actually rave about how much I love this app! The playlists are not only easy to find, but they have how long the playlist is in minutes on the screen too! I find this extremely helpful for timing my productivity throughout the day. This app also allows me to favorite certain songs I find in each playlist and save them to listen to later. I do wish it provided a way to find specific playlists out of my liked list, but other than that I absolutely adore this app.",

So what am I paying this company for. I ALREADY am dealing with the ads and not be able to skip tracks more than 3 times. I will uninstall before I have to pay $10 a month.

I've discovered tons of great music and have written many papers and studied for many tests using playlists that I found on it.

Not sure how many users need different brightness levels for biking vs driving. Would be better if user could manually set brightness by hours/time (ie brightness level 1 from 9pm to 6am).",

For some reason, my Asus Zenwatch constantly readjusts to low brightness leaving me unable to view the screen anywhere but indoors. This app keeps the brightness high when is the text that I am driving walking etc. The activity detection is very accurate in my experience. can set it anywhere from low to high depending on what you are doing and it will seamlessly change the brightness settings.",

Will save me from too-bright eye strain at night, and allow me to use my watch outside during the day, since Google removed the \"brightness boost\" feature in Android Wear 2.0, rendering my watch basically useless. Google and Asus should refer people to this app, before they return their Android Wear 2.0 watches which don't include an ambient-light sensor.  Their products make no sense without this.",

The gear live lacks any light sensor so this is almost a required app for that device.  It's pretty accurate about finding sunrise/set time for wherever your phone is on the globe, set different levels for day/night to each activity.  Profiles that are geofenced instead of activity based as well would be a welcome update.",

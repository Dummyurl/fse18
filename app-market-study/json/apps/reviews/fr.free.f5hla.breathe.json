        "comment": "Perfect in principle and very similar to Apples version. However, it isn't optimised for round watches, and android just displays a off centre square around it. Some of the animations are not smooth either. I love it but needs some improvement. Should also have some sort of a time limit like others have said, and could deliver notifications when heartbeat was high.",

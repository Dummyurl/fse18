Battery was approximately the same after my day of work compared to standard moto 360 faces, from the comments it seemed people had issue. Lots of customization, utility and it looks great. One annoying issue though, the time and date are on the bottom of the screen so when there's a notification (or in my case, Pandora which always shows) the most critical part is blocked. A nice option would be to put the battery displays on bottom and time on top. Please!",

My Urbane would previously go 2, nearly 3 days without a charge, I don't get through a day with this face running. I've pared back some of the actions, like disable location and the ISS updates but it still kills the battery. Great looking but no longer useable unfortunately.",

Both are exquisite and so customizable to get the look you want. Keep up the good work. Oh.... and those with battery drain problems, turn off the ISS tracker until you want to use it as that helps significantly.",

        "comment": "I'm actually delighted with my purchase of the arm BP monitor, I assume earlier issues with setting up have been dealt with because it was incredibly simple to do and took a couple of minutes.  My reasons for four stars not five are both app related, it is easy to use but finding out how to export to email for instance is not intuitive, and I'm fairly tech savvy. But good old Google soon provided the solution and once exported it's easy to copy and paste the numbers into a spreadsheet, work out overall averages etc for my GP.   My other small gripe is that I can't add a short note to readings - for example today my BP has changed and it would have been useful to have that recorded in the reading.  Otherwise really pleased and would definitely recommend, I'm now saving up for the scales :)",

Each of these devices are amazingly accurate and sync with this app with no effort at all, and has proved it's helpfulness to many of my family's doctor's!  I can not stress enough how excellent these products are, and they will blow your mind over the competitors out there!  I stand by my Koogeek devices 100% and will not buy any other because my family deserves the best, most reliable health care devices to keep their doctor's informed and aware of any trends or sudden changes each appointment, or immediately after being recorded because I have it all at my fingertips 24/7  in easily understood graphs and charts  allowing me to see the big picture for each and everyone in my house!  I can't brag enough about the features and technology the app and devices give you at such a reasonable, affordable price!  Also has motivated my to loose weight and be more active because I can see how my chart fluctuates when I give in to the goodies and slack off!  Haha!  It's so much worse when you see those changes in charts and graphs and it makes me want to beat my last score!  Haha",

        "comment": "I returned the pay version, so I played with free version.................................... I could not connect to ONKYO receiver. with my NOTE 4 phone. But other problem I found that when you select the channel by Icon let say Disney Channel then on top it shows the selected channel plus the Icon but then when I change channel to local by numbers the Disney channel still shows with the icon but on the bottom it shows with very small letters what's playing.And there is no LOCAL channels Icons that I can assign it my self to my  channels .......................... Other problem is that the channel return is hidden all the way in the back that you have to find it before you can go back to last channel. So it's not easy to do some stuff.  You should think what is more used when using remote or make it that a user can move and position buttons on it's own.....................",

        "comment": "I loved this app when first installed,  it worked a treat and allowed me to change the channels,  get into the planner, do anything my remote could do,  which was my saving grace after the Magic Eye stopped working for no reason. However, on day 3 it stopped working and I'm back to square one.  I uninstalled the app and tried again,  but it won't work. I've also tried other sky remote apps but they're all crap,  a shame then this failed cos I would've given it 5 stars :(",

Will see how this pans out - but for \u00a36 its cheaper than a replacement remote and seems less laggy than Panasonic's actual app, TV Remote 2. Plus I can control many more devices too with MyAV.",

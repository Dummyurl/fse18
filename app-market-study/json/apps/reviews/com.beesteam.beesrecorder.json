It works perfectly both on my Gs6 edge & LG G Watch R \u231a, it syncs as it records so theirs no waiting for a sync afterwards. This is the best voice recorder so far. Also, The Google Drive \u2601 save works seamlessly. I hope you guys never implement advertisements. I'd rather you take my money.",

I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever: this is one of the most beautiful apps I've ever used. It's ad-free, the recordings are produced at excellent qualities, automatic Google Drive backup is an option, support for Android Wear (I don't own one, but it's nice to know this is a feature), and the ability to tag specific points along the duration of the recording is magnificent. Congratulations on this masterpiece.  [EDIT]: as things were just too good to be true, every time I open this app and record something, the songs on my internal storage disappear from my music player; the issue persists until I reboot my device.",

When i try to place the '1 x1 widget' of Bees Recorder on my phone's homescreen, instead of placing the widget, it directly just opens the app. When i get back, the widget won't be placed either. Fix that in next update?)  Functional, clean, precise. Lot of functions with 4 sound quality options and 3 different scenes! All for free?? That's an amazing must have app for Android Wear users and others too ppl.. go ahead and download.. oh.. it's got G.drive backup too!",

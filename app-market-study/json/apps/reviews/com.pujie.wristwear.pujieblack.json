Very easy to make a slick looking, quality, information based watch face. Can assign the new wear complications (Facer can't). The editor is easy to use and fairly intuitive. Pujie is my new favorite!",

You can customize so much and make amazing faces, or just download some of the hundreds of great one already made for no additional fee.  The only down side is that since it's vector based not image based, there isn't much in the way of logos or cartoons.  Just amazing, efficient, customizable awesomeness.",

The only way to get grayscale ambient mode is to manually set the color of every element to some shade of gray. Keeps asking for permission for access to calendar, even though I don't use any calendar anything. Any configuration done on the watch doesn't seem to be sent back to the app (or at least, it happens very slowly), so when I change anything using the watch it leads to frustration. Color configuration is very detailed, almost anything can be changed independently of everything else. But that means if you just want to make ambient mode darker, you have to go in and adjust every element. Would prefer a decent colorpicker with reasonable presets over entering hex codes.",

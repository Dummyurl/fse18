        "comment": "Great for creating and managing check lists such as todo or shopping lists right there on your watch!  Could use faster input method like voice support -- but please always provide the on-watch keyboard as an option because voice sometimes can't be used.  Could use integration and sync with corresponding Adroid version.  Glad I do NOT have to push my data to the cloud to use it.  Over all, though, I think this is extremely useful and works great even just as it is -- and prefer it to any other similar app!",

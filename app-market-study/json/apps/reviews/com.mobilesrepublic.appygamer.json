        "comment": "The app is pretty good since it includes all the news sources you could want and is constantly adding more.   Given the amount of sources it does mean that at times images and videos won't load probably because of compatibility issues. But there's a nice workaround to that by using the \"Read this article on the web\" button at the end of an article.   Comments don't work at all, but I don't mind since I wouldn't use them anyway.   Speaking of which, a nice addition would be to disable reactions to articles.   They don't really offer much since there could be many reasons for one and no way to know what everyone means by them. They can easily be used to troll so it would be nice have the option to avoid them.   Great app nonetheless and hope the feedback is taken into consideration for further improvements.",

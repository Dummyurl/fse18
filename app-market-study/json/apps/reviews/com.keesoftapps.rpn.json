Also, the input method does not reflect a standard calculator. e.g. Press 6, press X, press 5, press enter/equals for the result. This app seems to want the following,  press 6, press enter, press 5, press X. Why? No calculator I have ever used operated like that, from super cheap desk models to very complex graphing calculators. This makes no sense to me.",

But for many months, this was the only RPN app I could find for Android Wear, so I continued to use it for \"lightweight\" calculations, despite the app's limitations. Recently, I discovered RetroCalc, an RPN app that displays correctly on my square Gear Live and has much bigger buttons. So I'm now a RetroCalc user. But I do miss RPN Calculator's better use of colors and contrasts. The smaller buttons in RPN Calculator are actually easier to read than the bigger buttons in RetroCalc!",

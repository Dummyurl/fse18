Since the default shows grades based on graded assignments I was under the impression that I had an 97% on one of my fast track classes. It turns out my grade was in the 70% range. I noticed it 2 weeks before my class was done.  I didn't know the couple of missing assignments had such a huge impact because of the way the point system displayed. The what if score feature is nice but it's not near as important seeing your true grades like the professors would see it. I am still going to be able to pass the class with a B but if I knew my true grade sooner, I would have made sure all my other assignments were completed to maintain my A+.",

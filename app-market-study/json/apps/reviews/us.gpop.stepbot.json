        "comment": "Great concept, but poor execution. The app crashes frequently, notifications seem to appear multiple times for the same thing, and the interface feels clunky. The \"tutorial\" explains very little about the game, and I had to visit the kickstarter page to get a description of the different stats. Energy drains absurdly fast, such that your bot runs out of energy if left alone for even 5 minutes. Perhaps this is part of the game design, but it doesn't make for a great experience. I love the idea of this game, but I don't enjoy the app as it exists currently.",

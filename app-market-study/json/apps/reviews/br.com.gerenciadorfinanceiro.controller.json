One of the main reasons for premium is to use the filter by tag in order to calculate some expenses, but this filter is always missing some items. No matter how many times I edit the missing itens and re-search, it is always missing some and not closing the math. For a finance application, not doing math right is a totally no go.",

        "comment": "First off, I don't care if you've been around 20 years and were the 1st app in the app store? When you start by making something that manages people's MONEY, and we see so much violation of the review system with so many falsely padded reviews, it's a clear sign that you aren't trustworthy people!! HELLO??? All I see are predominantly 1-4 star reviews, yet you have 150k 5 star reviews that ridiculouly overshadows the others and is clearly not reasonable or possible! When I mention it, you defend this? And you want us to trust you? From Brazil??? Yeah right!! ROFL!!! As for the app itself, I picked this up and started setup but couldn't finish because it needed much time, so I had to put it down. Coming back to it, now I'm confused what to do. It needs easy access instructions or setup tutorial. Very cumbersome, not intuitive to use or understand, and mostly found myself fighting with it before realizing it's not worth the aggravation. After that, I'm still not using an app with mostly fake and padded 5 star reviews. It just doesn't instill trust. This isn't a simple game! Doing this also takes the rating system out of user's hands and negates the one and only feature that we have! Thanks!! I don't trust someone who doesn't have my best interest at heart, uses a questionable mindset and tactics to promote their product, then wants access to my finances or my information. Get right with yourself!!",

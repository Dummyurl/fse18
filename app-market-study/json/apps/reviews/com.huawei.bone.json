Quite useless, it would be a lot better if we could pair the band's with phone directly and not with this broken app. Now not only pair with Health app not working but I can't for example use my band for Smart unlock, because it can't be paired as Bluetooth device properly (not possible to find it by other way than this app).",

If i could either change in-app language or language of my band, that would be great!",

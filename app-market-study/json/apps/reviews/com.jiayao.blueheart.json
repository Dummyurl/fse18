One annoying bug is that if I leave the app by pressing the crown on my watch, when I reload the app it won't reconnect to the HRM. Instead I must quit the app by swiping right; then it works fine the next time it starts up.",

I found one glitch, which unfortunately makes it unusable for me: if I turn off the watch display by covering the watch with my hand and then turn it back on by tapping the watch, the app no longer updates the heart rate.  My ideal app would also have some way to set up a notification when my heart rate gets too high or too low.  But I would understand if the author didn't want to ruin the simplicity of this app by adding features like that.",

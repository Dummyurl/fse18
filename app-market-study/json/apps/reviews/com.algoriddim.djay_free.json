Had to restart device to close app. Integrates with spotify but search time means previous track is finished before next one is cued. Would be no use at any party.",

Why such a difference between the two operating systems? If I could give less than one star I would. Please fix this and I'll give a good review as I did on ios.  Update: Over eight months later and STILL NOT DONE ANY IMPROVEMENTS! I've bought a new Android tablet and got a new phone, both not cheapos and guess what? Still the same issues on my new devices. If I could get my money back I would.........",

Upgraded to the s7 and downloaded the app, paid for upgrade and even bought djay 2 and was highly unsatisfied when i didnt see that feature.  Deleted djay 2, came on my chromebook and saw the feature in the photos and did the whole process again trying to get the iphone verison of this app on andriod and the only difference between the two is that feature, which makes mixing alot more fun. Please, I beg you, upgrade the app and add that feature. i dont want to get an iphone just to mix wen my extensive library of music is on my sd card. (which was the main reason I made the switch)",

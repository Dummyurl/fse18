Even if you lost your phone and your memory, you will probably remember that you are missing your phone way before this app realizes it.  And switching to display the alert on the phone is a different lvl of headache all together. If your watch runs out of charge or if you manually disconnect it this keeps showing notifications every 30seconds which is really irritating.",

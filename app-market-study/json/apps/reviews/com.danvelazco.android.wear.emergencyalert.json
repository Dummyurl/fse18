        "comment": "Its ok. Uncomplicated app that works. I agree with the other reviews that the limitation of only one recipient is a failing. If that one person doesn't see the sms for whatever reason the alert could be overlooked. The delay on the watch allowing time to cancel could be longer its little more than one second. Five seconds might be better.  Another app like this one has an option to message recipients that the sender is safe and the emergency has passed etc which seems like a useful inclusion. Would like to see a dedicated watch face/complication to make access to the app visually simple. The use of google assistant is a great idea, have yet to try it.",

        "comment": "I own a LG Urbane 2nd Edition W200 smart watch. I installed your \" Emergency Alert for Wear\" app. As you might know, the LG Urbane 2nd Edition can work autonomously without a phone connected. It is equipped with its own SIM card. Now you write in the \" WHAT'S NEW\" section \" - Only show a success message if the watch is connected to a phone.\". Is this true with the LG Urbane 2nd Edition as well? If yes, it was a drawback, as in the field I use to walk without the phone. Also it might have been stolen or got lost or became not functional due to an accident. In such cases it was maybe a lifesaver and therefore a significant improvement to your app, was such a function available on the watch without a connection to a phone. The number of smartwatches with a SIM card increases every season. So maybe you'll think about making this possible.",

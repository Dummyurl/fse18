        "comment": "I like it, but have had to stop using it as it is causing burn in on my g watch r. This is because of the date having a white background in ambient mode, and is big enough so that even when moving the watchface (part of the g watch r's burn in protection) it still causes burn in. It would be nice if there was an option to invert the date (white text on black background) then I could go back to using it. \ud83d\ude09",

Also brightness in dim/ambient mode is too high. Maybe it's better to add option to add brightness controll for wake and ambient mode.",

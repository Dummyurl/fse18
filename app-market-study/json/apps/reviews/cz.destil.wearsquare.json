It's great seeing apps take advantage of the new Foursquare (not just the Swarm side). It's too bad that the check in side keeps crashing. I would like to see the add-on on the phone side app to build in a setting to include Twitter and Facebook in the Swarm Check in. It is available on other Android Wear Apps. Overall, good job. Well thought out. +JoeKaton  Update: have seen the Beta side which solves the crash. Good work. I look forward to seeing the final and future updates.",

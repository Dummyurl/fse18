        "comment": "Really well done. Does exactly what it claims to. Only problem is the sudden crashes when selecting specific contacts (upon creating a new message). Would also love WhatsApp support, if possible! I like it a lot because google does not let me dictate messages in my native language, and because most of my conversations are in it, it's quite restricting. Plus I speak 4 languages, so this is an even bigger plus to me. This app, though, enables me to easily reply in any language, without even having to go through the embarrassment dictating in public can attract in some cases. I do, however, imagine google will at some point add a more native way to do it.",

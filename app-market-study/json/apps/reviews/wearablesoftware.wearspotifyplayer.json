I'm interested to see were the further development with this app. Bosses and customers really get bees in their bonnet when mobile are accessed  on the shop floor. I normally allow the playlist to ride until the wheels fall off. Yet this app allows me to control the mobile in an unconventional manner.",

When I go into \"Current Playlist\" and select a song it does not play the song I choose (yes I made sure I was not pressing a different song). It plays another song from the same playlist. This is a huge problem, devs. Fix it and this app would be great for the Moto 360 and worth 5 stars. Edit: the song I selected, the song playing, and the song displayed are all different. Yikes.",

However, one thing that really frustrates me is choosing a song on the playlist and it resetting my position every time. It should remember where i was scrolled to on the playlist.  If this is fixed i will up my rating.  Thanks.",

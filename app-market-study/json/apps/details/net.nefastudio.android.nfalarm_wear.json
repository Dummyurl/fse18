        "Maybe I'm just dumb, that I can't figure out how to set an alarm using this app. At this point, I'm uninstalling it and I'll look for something else that's easier to use.",
        "Matthew Howell, I had the same problem. I had to uninstall and install again on my phone. I also had to install on my watch, then I was able to set alarms. Hope you get it to work.",
        "It would be perfect if you could change snooze time",
        "I'd vote 5 stars, but if the watch is too far away from your phone it only vibrates once (not enough to wake you) then stops.  You can't trust it.  All I want is for the vibrate feature to work, and keep buzzing strongly until I wake and shut it off.  Is that too much to ask?",
        "Been using it for a while on my asus zenwatch 2. This app is much better than the default alarm app in wear. But waht makes this deserve 5 star is the terrific support from tje developer. I requested a feature (not very complex) and it was implemented in few hours. That was just awesome!",
        "So far, the only alarm app that vibrates even on theater mode on AW. That alone makes it worth 5 stars!"

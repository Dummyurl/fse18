        "Its really a good saving app. Because it helps you save with all the debit and credit cards you currently used.  The only thing I don't like is that when I want to withdraw any amount, it takes about a week to get transfer to my account. Just wish there was an instant option.",
        "Extremely easy to use for someone who is interested in saving for the future by investing, but doesn't really know where to start. Roundups has been very helpful getting me to see a little can add up to a lot in a small amount of time. I tested withdrawals and the money was in my account in the amount of days promised. I like that the money is not as easy to withdraw as the money in my regular savings because I am not as tempted to use for little purchases, that I really don't need. I plan on reinvesting the money I withdrew back into Acorns now I know the withdrawal worked as promised. I like the versatility of one-time, automatic or roundup √ó1 √ó2, just change or round 1.00 up as well and that I can change settings anytime I want. If things are going good, slow, bonus at work etc...So far I like just about everything and I have read some amazing tips on here that I may not have stumbled upon elsewhere. üëçüëç.",
        "The more money I put in, the more money they lose. I don't think I have seen my account positive ever. You would get more return with a low interest savings account than this garbage. But hey they will link you a story that promises things will get better. And when they do we will lose all that too.",
        "Beware of a craigslist scammer named Matt. He'll say he's going to pay you 60 bucks to download,  register,  and give feedback on your experience. Long story short...... This is just a desperate attempt to gain more users of this app and Stash as well.  Really lame and a waste of time.",
        "Poor customer service. They do not respond inquiries. The only reason I started an account was to round up my change. After having an account open for 27 days, not a single cent was rounded up an invested. I had my account linked and my cards linked. I use my cards regularly.",
        "I downloaded the app and then starting reading the reviews. Way too many people complaining they can't get their money, can't verify accounts, but still have them easily charging them every month without fail. Make sure you read the reviews before you make the decision to go with these guys."

        "By far the best tracking app I've tried.  Great selection of base maps.  Lots of custom features.  (Took a bit of time to figure out my favorite preferences.)   Has everything I need.",
        "Nice app but needs Google Drive integration and more USA topo maps.  App seems to be geared to Europe mostly.",
        "Super !  Logical/pragmatic-it works!  Clearly developed by a \"doer\" that knows our outdoor needs.",
        "Map of Phoenix is about 25 years old.",
        "I love it",
        "This app works quite well. The interface is there and easy to get the hang of. I used this today for a state forest and it contained all the trails (a lot more than I thought it would). My only complaint is that offline mapping is a little weird. Other than that, a very good alternative to Gaia"

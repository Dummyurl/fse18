        "Good app, helpful to do my college classes. However with one of these recent updates, it's killed the calendar. No assignments or due dates show up whatsoever for me. And yes, I do have all the correct calendars turned on in the settings.  Edit: The calendar is still broken unfortunately. When will it be fixed, do you have a date on the next update?",
        "New design is hard on the eyes. Constant drops of app and loss of work while doing required responses. Every semester I have to go thru a process to uninstall, clear and reinstall to be able to access/view the calender of my current classes. Customer service is mediocre to resolve issues.",
        "Despite installing and reinstalling several times, I am unable to see any grades. All of the classes and assignments are there, but I cannot get any grades to appear. ** Response to developer's reply:  thanks for the info, but I have already ensured that show grades is turned on, and I have also submitted a trouble ticket but never received a response.",
        "Even after the most recent update there are issues with the to-do widget. All of the items compress into one unreadable \"to-do\" and the only way to get them to show up properly is to delete the widget and replace it on the screen. This would be such a great feature if it worked properly. It's so close to being 5 stars.",
        "I very rarely give out reviews, but the new update drastically changed not only the layout but does not allow me to see my courses in the app. The older version was just fine and this update affects my ability to remain in the class.",
        "Sucks! TO MANY COMPATIBILITY ISSUES! I can not even read my online book... All that's on my screen when I click on any chapter is a big white screen. GOOD LUCK TRYING TO FIX IT."

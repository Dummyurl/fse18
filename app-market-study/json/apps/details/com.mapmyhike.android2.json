        "Used to love this app. Recently though it stops the tracking while in coat and phone not in direct use. Big gaps in the route. App appears as though closing as have to open again when finished route. Have checked all Support items, app set to full use, no battery save, high GPS, always on etc shame.",
        "Began testing this two days ago. Compared to a current fave @ $20.00/year, this @ $30.00/year is way too expensive for my needs. Both apps look identical, too, by the way. This works great, tracks well. But like too many other walking/running apps I've tested, it's overkill. It offers far more than I need or want. Uninstalling.",
        "Been using this app for 1 week now on my lg g5 titan, not had a problem with it at all, really good app, never missed a beat, has kept track of all that I have asked it to. This has given me an incentive to keep going and going daily which is what I need for my injury, I do have a few issues one been that I have to keep selecting save when I have done a route and I keep forgetting to save it but it still keeps my stats which is good I suppose, second issue is that I would love to upgrade to the full version but I just find it to be rather expensive. So as a whole apps great does the majority of my needs and I would actually recommend it, so to the developers a huge well done but drop your price a bit and stop making people pay as much to remain healthy since we pay enough for the phones and data etc anyway",

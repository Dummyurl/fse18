        "It's easy to read and use. However  the weather is not updated often enough so it works well when giving a general outlook but the hourly outlook needs to be questioned. A small annoyance is that it always asks if it can turn on the GPS or would the chosen city be preferred. This interruption is not needed.  This app works well overall."

        "Is this for watching videos or for using as a remote? Because trying to do both is just weird. Since this former video player started doing two things badly instead of one thing well, I can no longer delete videos, and the rotate button only rotates clockwise, or back again. Just plain stupid.",
        "Please, please, please make the remote a default opening setting! Most annoying thing on this app is it opens to My Library yet that function doesn't work! I just want the remote!",
        "It's a great app, but it does have occasional annoying glitches where by nothing will play whatsoever. I've been trying all day to sort but cannot yet. It has happened before so hopefully will sort itself out. Other that that it's great and very useful for casting onto any home tv",
        "We just need a good remote and to control our TV and watch movies, shows in it. Please stop recommending videos in this app. Just remove that section, it's really annoying and really making the app slow when opening and connecting to TV",
        "Why is this app necessary to use the video application? Bollocks.",

        "Used to be a good app, now I literally can't load ANY coupons to my card, haven't been able to for days, keeps saying \"experiencing technical difficulties\", how long are the \"technical difficulties\" going to last???",
        "Hooray! A new era in grocery shopping has begun! Registered with ClickList. Add items to the cart throughout the week. Submit and pay thru the app. Then just schedule and pickup outside the store. It even shows coupons I'd normally miss. LOVE!",
        "Recently updated my app, now I can't load coupons onto my card!!!! I had to leave the grocery store because I can't afford to shop without coupons",
        "When checking out app keeps telling me that I have switched stores which I haven't and everything in my cart is unavailable. Prices are still wrong and coupons and sale prices are not applied to products. This app is horrible and developers seem unable or unwilling to fix. Just about done with king soopers over this. For the same price Wal-Mart will deliver to my home instead of me having to puck up."

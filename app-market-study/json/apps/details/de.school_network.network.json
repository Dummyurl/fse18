        "Very Functional Exactly what I was looking for! However there are many bugs, especially with the layout.",
        "Awesome Really useful. I love the calendar feature.  Would be cooler if it had a tasks widget as well. And a feature that lets you select a lesson from your timetable to select a due date as you create a new task.",
        "NEEDS STUDENTVUE SUPPORT. I would love this app if it supported StudentVue, you should look into it!",
        "Untis connected, won't sync I have connected this app to the Untis webservice of my school yet it won't synchronize with my system. Can you look into this please?",
        "Lots of potential Definitely on the right track to being a 5 star worthy app.",

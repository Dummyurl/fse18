        "Love the app.  I use it to track every round I play.  Only minor glitch is putting in hole by hole score ..... when you get to hole 18 it doesn't tab down to the putt tab automatically so you accidently put the number of putts on the hole for your score.  Seems would be an easy fix.  All in all its a keeper.  Definately hope the little putt score situation on hole 18 is fixed soon......also interested in further comlplex fun adjunct development.",
        "love the App. occasionally it crashes but it saves the data so you don't lose everything. worst case I update online. the online app is great. lots of analysis.",
        "It won't let me enter scores.  Paid for 3 years.  Entered scores for 2 months.  Now it won't allow it.  Emailed support twice with no answer.  Updated my AP.  Still doesn't work.",
        "Downloaded the app, got to the log on and register page, wud not set up to facebook as said couldnt due to the app, went to register myself and it would not accept my postcode no matter how i presented it, with spaces n without, cap/lower case and just first 3 letters",
        "Worked well the first year but I ran into an issue with the app during renewal. Been paying for a year and can't get it working and support claims I haven't paid even after showing them my receipt. They've become unresponsive or slow to respond. Can't recommend.",
        "I liked the app...until I got my 5 scores in! Wasn't sure I wanted to keep the app because it's not tied into the GHIN system.   Now I can't even go in to see what my prior scores are!  Unfortunately, 'Myscorecard' has convinced me not to purchase"

        "Updated scoring system.  We have rebuilt the scoring system from the ground-up.  Whether entering total score, hole by hole, or stroke by stroke/on the course or off, the new version of the round scoring should provide a much easier way to enter your round."

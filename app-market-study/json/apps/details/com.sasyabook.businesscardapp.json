        "Great app! Would be very helpful to be able to edit the phone number labels though. Maybe in the future?",
        "Excellent alternative instead of paper, but... Works for me.  But let me suggest include in the new version a logo and background.",
        "I am using this app more and more. It is a value for me and for customers because they simply scan my data in. However, the Adress format is not in all regions over the world the same, if this could be adjusted it would make it even better.",
        "Goodconcept, will be useful for professionals",
        "Works as described.",

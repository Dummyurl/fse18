        "Terribly disappointed that this app no longer functions. ZERO markets displayed, I've deleted and reinstalled the app six times and it simply doesn't work.   My  previous 5 star review:  I love that every single world market and commodities prices are displayed perfectly and are very easy to read",
        "This app has all the tools I need to keep up with my investments. I still haven't figured out all it does, but I'm getting there!  Each screen can be customized to show exactly what you want. Its very user friendly - easy to change and easy to navigate.",
        "I like it a lot! But.... the screener has no input parameters. And the charts a bit non intuitive and lack customization. 3 stars for now but if this app adds screener input fields and a better charting section i would rate it 5+ stars!!! Its a good app all good information except for the lack of the previously mentioned things",
        "Better app than most, loaded w/info for stocks,currency & other commodities.  The only recom'd is no ability to toggle betw pages (market/stocks/currency..) But must go fwd or bck 1 the page @ a time.",
        "The Best Market App I've Ever Used!  But...updates on 10/10/17 and again on 10/11/17 created an error in the News section as images were not displayed for each story. But after deleting the data and cache, app works perfect again.",
        "I've tried to use the app multiple times today. It has crashed on me every time and lost all my preferences. Up until today it was working great. What happened? Is it because Samsung sent out out a software update to their phones?"

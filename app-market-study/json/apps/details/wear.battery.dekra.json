        "Looks nice, needs some work still. Nice looking app I must say, quite clean.  An issue and a few thoughts. One, the \"application\" that gets installed to the wear device is called \"My Application\". I also almost always have the battery notification on my wear device. I'd rather have it configurable from the phone to send a notification at various thresholds. That plus on-demand checking by launching the Battery Wear app from the wear device itself. Otherwise, good start!",
        "When it works The app works great when u 1st open it. After a while, tho, I notice that it stops sending notifications. I have to reopen the app on my phone to get it working again, then the cycle starts all over..."

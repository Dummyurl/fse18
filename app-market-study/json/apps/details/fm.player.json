        "Moving from one star to two. All the new stuff is very pretty but sadly its too unreliable. 3 podcasts not updating today, but are fine in my backup app. The fact I need a backup app on my phone shows this is not an isolated incident",
        "Have used this app for a year with no problems. Last week or so half my feeds have not been synchronising properly. Switching to another podcast app until they fix it",
        "Terrible. About 1 out of 10 uses results in my note 8 overheating and draining the battery in 2-3 hours. I can use any other player for 30+ hours and they don't turn my phone into a hand warmer.  It appears they are aware of issues. I hope they are resolved soon. Just don't fall asleep without terminating the app manually, it's otherwise a good app. System warns of battery drain caused by player FM generally when the app is not playing sound and is closed but still running in background (often when sleep after episode is used)  Tried to send logs, but I'm unsure if they went through.",
        "Terribly. Very buggy. I wanted to like it, but had to delete it",
        "The app is mostly fine, but the skip episode setup is a bit wonky. I find that I have to hit previous track to play the downloaded episodes I have.",
        "Really janky app, for a long time have had issues downloading episodes, when trying to download on cellular it's almost impossible"

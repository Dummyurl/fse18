        "Not for round watch It is not really for round watches like the moto 360. The flash is so far left, I just can't control it. How fo I switch between front and back camera? It does it I just don't see how I can control it. It just happens and mostly not when I want. If both are fixed I give it 5 stars.",
        "Round screen Not optimal for round screens. Cuts off the end buttons making it unusable to a point",
        "Great !! Works fine on Moto360. Buttons need be adjusted a bit for round dial but overall good..",

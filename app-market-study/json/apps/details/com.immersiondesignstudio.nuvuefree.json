        "Doesn't work",
        "Needs more controls No way to unsubscribe from emails as far as I can see. Fills up my inbox like crazy when adding new media. Needs more user controls on how to receive notifications.",
        "How to make it work?? Does not contact my plex server. I have a fully paid plex-pass.  WHat does it mean \"Requires shared library owners to have nuVue and Pay-It-Forward license\" ?????",
        "Ok well i been testing this app for couple of hours now, you have to set everything on the settings like refresh time and to show  your preferences as for just playing or added items, I set mine to whats playing FYI it wont sync to your phone automatically it takes between 4-6 min to send you the notification to your phone on who is playing what.  I personally used it to have more control over my plex server since I found a cheater in my friends list he shared his user name to various people so this app is perfect it tells me who is playing what and from wich system they are playing it from."

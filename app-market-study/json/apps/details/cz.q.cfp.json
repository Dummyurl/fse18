        "Unfortunately, after switching phones I was not able to import the database. The app keeps crashing. That was it: all my data is gone. I'm not going to invest more time, setting everything up again, just to lose more data later. Bye bye CFPatrol.",
        "I use it for tracking the finances during vacations and it has everything I need. I especially like the widget to quickly add a new expense. the only thing I would love to have would be automatic location tracking.",
        "All good but no use without everyother week option. Better would be to add multiplier for week or month etc.",
        "very good easy and smooth interface. the best expense managing app ive used so far.    but please add  fortnightly repeatable transactions and transacrions trackable for both resources when transferring to another resource for your update.",
        "Fortnightly? Lovely app however I can use it as there is no fortnightly option."

        "Really good for working collaboratively on projects. For more  personal use it would be great if you could move the cards on the page that collates all your cards from different boards into an order you plan to do them (without faffing about with putting a due date on them that is liable to change). Even better would be if you could move the cards around in a quadrant: bottom left = easy, not important, top left = easy, important, top right = difficult, important, bottom right normally = difficult, not important, but I list my personal to-dos in here eg buy birthday pressie, wash car, book hair etc! Hope you might consider this functionality - would make my life complete! ðŸ˜‰ But great work so far! ðŸ˜Š. Thanks!",
        "It's a good app! The bug invloving picture orinetation on v30 has been fixed in latest update. The support team took initiative and worked with me to get the bug sent to the tech team. Very impressed!",
        "When replying to someone's comment, I would like to see it as you would in Facebook (tiered comments). This would make it easier to know which comments relate to which. As of now, there is no structure to them and it can be confusing especially if you all looking at a card that is not current.",
        "The best cross-platform way of planning together and sharing progress. Every now and then it would be nice to have a few features like swimlanes for subtasks etc but that could just be that I'm way to demanding from my background in software engineering",
        "Why do i have to add myself to members to see a card in the widget each time i create a card? It's a bit complicated but boy is it feature rich.",
        "Trello is awesome for making lists and categorizing them, but there's no way to alphabetize items in a list. Please add an option to do this!"

        "(DISCLAIMER LEGAL MADE ME PUT IN: For security reasons, Trello does not advise that you make everyone in the world an administrator of your boards.)",
        "- We've boosted performance for those of you with particularly large boards. We're no longer unintentionally punishing those of you who enjoy Trello to the max."

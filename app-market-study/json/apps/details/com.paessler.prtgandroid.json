If you encounter any bugs, please send them to support@paessler.com, as we're not notified of new comments.Features include:• Full visibility into the state of your probes, groups, devices, sensors, and channels on multiple PRTG instances.• Pause, acknowledge alarms, trigger scans, run device auto-discovery, etc. You can do a lot of things with the app that you can over the web interface or the Enterprise Console, with an interface tailored to your mobile device.• QR code scanning makes it easy to jump directly to a sensor.• Enhanced notifications can (optionally) alert you in your device's status bar when PRTG finds problems on your network.• Home screen widgets (available only on 4.1 or higher, sorry!) allow you to keep an eye on your network without the app running in the foreground.• Network tools such as ping, traceroute, and DNS lookups are included. We'll be adding more in the future!To use this app, you need to run an installation of PRTG Network Monitor 14.1 or later that is accessible from the network your device is connected to. If you don't have a PRTG Network Monitor installed, you can still try a demo account, and the network tools are completely independent and don't require any PRTG server to operate.Running an older version of Android or an older PRTG release? You can still use our previous release, PRTGdroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paessler.prtgRequired Permissions:• INTERNET - Rather critical :-)• CAMERA - Required for the QR scanner.• WAKE_LOCK - Necessary for the alert functionality. Don't worry, we put a lot of effort into keeping our battery and network use as low as possible.• Notifications can optionally VIBRATE your phone.• We use ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and ACCESS_WIFI_STATE to check if the internet is available, and to determine whether or not we should load large graphs (we don't load them when you're on a mobile data network).• WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is needed to cache certain data.• RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED lets us set notifications back up after a reboot.If you have any problems or suggestions, we're happy to hear them.

        "Good app but after last update I can't login. Says password isn't valid but password hasn't changed. Hopefully you can assist? Running android version 7+ and PRTG version 17+. Password field in PRTG app says it's using a \"passhash\"?  Contacted support, issue fixed now. Great app & good support. Thx.",
        "Overall great app however latest upgrade hasn't stopped maps from loading due to (incorrectly reported) out of date browser which is a pain when using maps for oncall overview dashboard",
        "Would be great if the push notification sound could have two sounds, a sad sound when service is down, and a happy sound when back up.  Right now you don't know if you should be happy or sad when the push comes.",
        "I had originally rated this app a 1 star.  However, Stephan Linke with PRTG's support team was gracious and diligently worked with me to get this app working on my phone.  His efforts deserve 5 stars!",
        "Everything worked till I restart the phone. After reboot, none of the widgets work. After adding new still doesn't work",
        "Awesome app especially with the widgets and push notifications! Would have 5* easily if I could get rid of the 'PRTG notifications are enabled' from the android pull down menu. Really annoying since push works etc and I have set it to 99 hours. Any tips ?"

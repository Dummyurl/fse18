        "Great potential... Since a lot of people dont get it, this app is basically a Bluetooth device scanner. You can buy special little tags that transmit a BLE or similar signal, which you can place on a pet, child, luggage etc. and can keep a proximity tab on them. It's also a great diagnostic tool to check make sure your other BLE and like devices are transmitting. I really like the simplicity of this app.",

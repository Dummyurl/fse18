        "Its a great way to see scores and news",
        "The last update does nothing to improve this app, was better before. I have always liked this app and use it daily, dropped 1 to 2 stars because of that last update, hope they rethink this recent change for the worse.",
        "1. Design was better before the new 'modern' update. 2. There is still a bug with the pitchers' stats: the box scores fail to record when a pitcher gives up a home run. There is no excuse for this!",
        "Really nice easy to use MLB app for schedules scores standings & news through out the season as well as news during off season news! Very easy to use & I really like to new layout & latest update !",
        "This us a really good source for quick access to scores and other information.  I was happier with the GAMES screen before the update, but like that it shows the team's W/L stats right up front.",
        "The update hasn't really changed much and it did take a while to get used to but I have had no issues with alerts or game info since so overall still a good app!"

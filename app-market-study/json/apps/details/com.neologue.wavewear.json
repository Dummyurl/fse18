    "description": "Control apps with speech and movementFlickStart lets you create commands to send to other apps.You can trigger those commands with speech or by moving your phone or Androidwear watch.The commands you can trigger might be as simple as bringing a specific app to the screen or more complex actions like toggling PAUSE on your music player, taking a photo, or answering your phone.You can even send and playback SMSs completely hands free! Of course you can do some of that using \"OK Google\", but FlickStart gives you a great deal of flexibility for customization. For instance it takes just a few moments to create commands that will take a picture with the front and the back camera at the same time (although not all phones' cameras can actually do that). All you do is set up two commands one using the back camera and one using the front camera, and have both commands triggered by the same action (eg. saying 'photo both'). In fact you could set up two commands to trigger front and back photos with a single movement of your Android wear watch just as easily. Note: Photo and speech-to-text operations (like reading out SMSs) require Android 5.0 or higher.If you add in our FlickNet app you can extend control to the apps on your PC.When you install FlickStart it comes with many commands already set up. Those commands do operations that aren't specific to any app, but if you go to the Downloads page (http://flickstart.com.au/en/downloads.py) on our website you will find scripts containing commands that tune FlickStart to specific apps. Look through the lists under different categories and add them to your copy of FlickStart. The scripts are grouped by whether the target apps are on your phone/watch, or on your PC. They are also split by whether the trigger is speech based or movement based. You can use the scripts as is or as a base for building your own scripts.FlickStart provides a high degree of customization, whether by altering the commands already available, or by building your own. Commands can access built-in functions that range from driving the phone's cameras through to reading or writing your phone's SMS, Calendar and Contacts databases. Clipboard access is also available. Fields in commands can access speech input and can evaluate expressions. And, commands can save data and share data between themselves, allowing more complex tasks to be carried out in a series of steps.FlickStart is free for one week after download. You can do a once-off in-app purchase at any time to remove the limitations that drop into place after one week if the app is not purchased. The Speech Module in FlickStart also requires a once-off in-app purchase after the first week of use.Check the website (http://flickstart.com.au\") for a more details. Have a look at the FlickStart related videos (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtASE30oEDGXFLWRM0BQfiQ/videos).",

        "Wow! This app needs some work but its outstanding! I can finally have it so i can quickly open an app at the flick of a wrist and not worry about it turning on all the time due to stupid hand movements! Great job and keep it up!",
        "But I'll get the hang of it.  Kodos to the Dev!   One lil annoying thing though, when I switch to another app and then back to FlickStart, the intro popup continues to pop up. I'd expect it only to pop up with every initial launch when I ask to see it next time.    FlickStart is off to a great start!"

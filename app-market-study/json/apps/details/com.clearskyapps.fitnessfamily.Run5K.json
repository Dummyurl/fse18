        "During my free trial the app stopped twice. Once when I was halfway the second session, so I had to start all over; and another time at the last walk of W2D1. This really put me off progressing to a paid version. Will be looking for a different app.",
        "It is a great program. I have a few of the apps they have and they are all great. I do not ise the tracking distance since it does not seem to track correctly, could be due to the constant cloud cover over my area. I also don't use gear so I cannot vouch for that aspect of the apps, though it does say it supports at least a few.  Being a former Marine coming off an injury they have helped me rehab nicely. Used these in the past to get me ready and stay ready for fitness tests. Only complaint is that now each one is pay to use and I can't do a bundle price. Is that something coming in the near future?",
        "An excellent app; keeps instructions to a minimum and just a tiny bit of encouragement at the right moments. You can keep repeating a stage if you don't feel ready to move on, and the data on each run is brilliant.",
        "I love this app, a friend recommended it, I wasn't intending to start running but the ease of it using this app and my friends inspired me. I am at the beginning and it is not easy for me but not too hard that I want to quit. My only issue is, it says there is a music icon so I can listen to music but I can't find it. Give it a try.",
        "I began the program two days ago. As I am unfit, the first session pushed me just enough. It is motivating and well-planned. I definitely felt the burn the day after and left me looking forward to the next run!",
        "Considering I haven't taken care of myself in... ever, I've figured; when better than now to start running. 5K Runner is just what I needed to get started, I really feel as though I'm getting precisely the right cardio workout for my current fitness level."

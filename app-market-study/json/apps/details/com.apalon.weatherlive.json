        "Great app, love the details. However. The radar could use some tweaks. Id like it if you could slow it down, and instead of two hour increments, make it half hour so it's more detailed and useful. At the moment the radar doesn't show my information I can use. Also, the background pictures of the weather need to be formatted for the Galaxy S8 screens.",
        "Since providing initial feedback and response by provider i have updated to five stars. Accuracy is now spot on and layout and other information is great. Thanks. I like the look and functionality but unfortunately the accuracy is not great. Often shows to expect rain on rainless days. Temperature and and cloud cover reasonably accurate. If forecast was consistently accurate I would give 5 stars. I'm using the paid version. Thank you.",
        "The widgets don't work for me. They'll be fine for a few days and then they'll go blank and never show anything until I replace them on my home screen. The clock only updates when the weather does, so you can't use it as a clock either. It looks pretty when it does work, though",
        "PERFECTION!! I HAD UNINSTALLED THIS APP A WHILE BACK DUE TO THE MY PHONE PROBLEMS, THAT HAS SINCE BEEN FIXED AND I HAVE NOW GOT MY WEATHER LIVE BACK ON BOARD!! ITS A VERY INFORMATIVE AND EASY TO USE, GREAT WORK DEV TEAM üëç ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "What did you Do to this APP?  I can no longer send Corrections when it's Wrong?   Do you Mean even when I don't WANT to use the \"Live Wallpaper,  I have no Choice?  And have Less Functionality than with your Less expensive version of only. 99¬¢,  to just Remove Ads?  Why did I pay for More,  but get less?  About to ININSTALL and Return to the Junky Stock app run by so-called AccuWeather",
        "Great, accurate weather app This app gives you accurate, official warnings from the national weather services. I've tried it with the Belgian and German weather services. You also get a warning for example half an hour before rain begins. So far I did not experience any errors in such warnings. Keep up your good work!"

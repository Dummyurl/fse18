        "Well I love slides because it's a great way to organize your things.. although it would be much better if there were an option to add animation and to make thing pop out as an example but I really do enjoy completing work on this app:)",
        "This was so hard it would not bring up any of past and present slides. It was frustrating and annoying. I would not recommend the app as much as I would recommend using it on an actual laptop or desktop computer",
        "I have had constant troubles with the app it is constantly stopping and freezing up one me. I really try to get work done for my classes but i can do anything with it like this.",
        "I used to love this app ðŸ’” But not now! Because when I'm going to \"Create a New Slides file, New Powerpoint file\", Edit & Settings, Closes the app & opens my other app with the name of CCleanerðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ Please solve these problems soon!",
        "Big waste. I am nervous to use it. Initially saved files ( ex: images), I did not find them. Later I realized that it saves, but I cannot see them nor use them. So what is the point of having such options.",
        "This app ALWAYS worked, but now it can't load ANYTHING. My connection is excellent, so I'm confused of why it's not loading any of my presentations!"

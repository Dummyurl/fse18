        "The current app has improved a lot over previous versions but can still be a little slow when navigating back and forth for your order. Also the pop-up adds can be a pain and get in the way. Other than that it's way better than the Pizza hut one.",
        "Very slow to do anything and the new drew thing unfortunately doesn't understand English words, let alone Maori words... Pretty useless.. I still like the pizza, get rid of drew assist and the constant pop ups to add to order.. and get the road names of where your stores are correct spelling it would better... I resort to using web to order as it's quicker...AND SICK OF THE STUPID POP UPS SO MUCH.GRRRRRRRR",
        "Recent update with order tracker and timer means if you select timer it. Resets despite charging card. I've been to the store and they are remaking which is fine but this is a breaking glitch.  Defeats the purpose of ordering ahead",
        "Better to download this you can do it on website atleast they will show you some updates and deals and i think It's nonsense app.  and it should be more responsive and it would be good if it's showing new deal or specials",
        "A little bit difficult to navigate around but good. Credit card scanning feature doesn't work on a galaxy note 8 for some reason",
        "It is a little laggy, but does the job just fine. Def. better than no app)"

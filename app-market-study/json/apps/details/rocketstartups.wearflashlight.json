        "Simple but Works Does all you would need with a flashlight. There are two color choices both adjustable that alternate with a touch of the screen. A slide to the right and it's off. Adjustments are made by swiping left. Simple.",
        "Does not work.",
        "I downloaded it and i couldnt find the app to open it",
        "Perfect for preventing screen burn in ðŸ¤“",
        "Really cool...and useful! The first time I installed it, it didn't seem to work. I re-synced the apps through Android Wear and it came up. That's the only fault.. and it was mine. This is such a great and simple app which will come in handy often. Thankyou!",
        "Works as described Initially the \"OK Google, start flashlight\" launched the flashlight app on my phone. Ah, a conflict I thought. Then realised the Android wear version hasn't finished downloading and installing. After waiting, the phrase actually launched the wear app instead. Brilliantly simple. On screen toggle button would be good."

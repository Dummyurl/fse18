        "Works well when I need to find my phone. A ton of weird features that I have no desire to explore.",
        "Great app. Wear watch can alarm vibrate when bluetooth connection with phone terminates, you can also find phone with one click on wear watch - phone can alarm vibrate rings sound light a fleslight or alltogether. Great app!",
        "Works well if you only need to find the phone, fails if you need alerts that you left your phone behind.  If the watch is also connected to Wi-Fi, turning off Bluetooth on the phone (as a proxy for going far enough from the phone) doesn't completely sever the connection to the watch, so the watch doesn't alert that it's no longer directly connected to the phone.",
        "It is super unreliable. At least once a day it goes off when I'm sitting next to my phone.",
        "Used to love this app, but apparently it can not be installed on my Ticwatch (Android Wear 2), so it's pretty much useless now",
        "I have turned off the left phone alerts and just use it as an alternative to the Apple watch 'ping' phone"

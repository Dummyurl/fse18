        "This is fine for a simple and free speedo, works fine with the GPS on the watch (Sony Smartwatch 3), but I need tenths of a knot (for sailing dinghies) and would like to be able to install-on/move-to the SD card of my phone as it has very little memory (LG Wine). Thanks.",
        "Sometimes inaccurate, but overall consistent",
        "Light, minimal, & accurate. Couldn't ask for more!",
        "Good on fossil",
        "Nice",
        "Speed stuck at 0 I have nexus 5 rooted on 5.1 with location enabled along with moto 360 first gen . I tried for a few days and the speed never crossed 0.  Is there a solution and subsequently a way to increase the review rating."

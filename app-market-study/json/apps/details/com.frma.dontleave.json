        "It works. One big problem. It will run till it runs down your watch battery, if you leave your watch behind at your home. There is not any way to tell it to automatically turn off the alert after xx number of seconds. Example I left my watch on the charger, but took my phn. The app ran the entire time I was gone. Charger could not keep up with the drain.",

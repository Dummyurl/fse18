        "Suddenly I have to pay again. Trash app anyway",
        "Not really fair having to pay again Paid for the original version of guitar solo and now this one comes along and have to pay again for essentially the same functionality . Sorry but that's a kick in the teeth for those who purchased the original. Update - developer responded but not in a consumer centric manner. Won't be using the app that I previously purchased. Clearly there's not even an incentive to upgrade.",
        "Got worse after purchase Slow loading with every menu selection. Setting changes do not fix. From strum to sound, rhythm has lag. Not able to rotate or adjust to hold comfy grip. Samsung galaxy s3 worked better, please refund.",
        "It works great, I absolutely love this app. At one point I had a slight issue and I emailed the developer and he got back to me right away and helped fixed the problem!",
        "Not a free app.  And customer service is terrible I downloaded guitar solo. (Original app) It wasn't free either.  But I did a promotion to get full version. App has been updated a couple times and now the new version is $3 so I asked dev for help. Was told I didn't buy new version so I needed to download old version again.   So I went to find it.  Now it's $3 too. I asked dev for access to it again and was given sob story about taking money from his kids mouth and I should just buy it again.  Save your time and your money.  Uninstalling this garbage",
        "this is legal? got it on my lg g4 ONLY so i could use it in tandem with my samsung Gs2 watch,( that the add says is supported). tried to sync gear 2s watch to app and it said i now have to wait for it to come to samsung store....Im,bummed."

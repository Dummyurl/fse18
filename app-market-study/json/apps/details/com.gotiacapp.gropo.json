        "Works great, but need some inprovements 1. Squeeze out all the none English words. There are still plenty.  2. Not sure if its possible, but try to connect to the camera without the phone. New android wear should allow that. 3. Viewfinder in a watch would be a killer feature. I'd pay 10 times for that.",
        "Passable Using hero 3+ silver, HTC one m7, and Moto 360 all up to date.  Decent app gets a little finicky connecting sometimes, and I've noticed the record on/off command doesn't always sync with the camera, even when the app thinks it has.  Also, the modes cycle properly, but the camera always turns off when I try to change settings like resolution and fov.  App is usable, but could certainly stand some help.",
        "Really lacking instructions, but shows promise Watch the video at the top of the page. This should give you enough clues to get it going. I was baffled as to what i was supposed to do. The phone app just sets the camera name and password (gives no feedback as to success). Installing the phone app simultaneously installs a watch app. Go look for it.",
        "Nice app Tested with nexus 5, Moto 360 and hero 3 silver and was able to control gopro and change settings.  fonts size a little big but that's just cosmetic.  Thx",
        "What am I do wrong Doesn't work with Xperia Z3. I can connect my gopro (hero3 black) to the phone and to the smartwatch (sony  SW3), I tryed all the variants - but the app doesn' connect to the gopro. I've fill gopro name and password in the phone part of app, then press accept - it says \"Guardado\" - and that's all. The oficial gopro app in the phone works fine. What should I du to connect gopro tu SW?  UPD: I got connection, but it doesn't 'work properly - changes video resolution to wrong one (not choiced), and after some setting changes (didn't find what depends on, but mostly when swiched to 1080p30) it hangs my gopro, so it shows wrong info on the LCD and doesn't response right (software or camera buttons), only battery disconnectiong helps, camera goes to default settings then. Seems not frendly to gopro3",
        "Doesn't work Can't seem to get the app on the watch, it's downloaded on the phone, the phone is connected.... but no app on the watch"

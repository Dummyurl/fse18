        "Amazed, finally what I was looking for. Easy to use, HRM live and keeping records of the workouts.  Good job.  Missing: possibility to add text/comments to workout history logs  Works well with Huawei Mate9 and Decathlon chest strap.  I like the DJ feature, but none of my hundreds MP3 have a BPM ID3 tag :-(. Will have to find some computer SW to detect BPM and update my MP3 files.",
        "Great app, simple with a great interface. One of the few, simple, non social, no subscription fitness apps which also has an android wear app.  My only gripes - 1. Does not export data in a true csv format. Can't import into excel. Heart rate and time do not end up as columns. You can go through the extra step of exporting tcx and using a converter 2. Export to Google Fit does not work.",
        "I'm gonna give this a shot in tomorrow's workout and decide. After a couple of quick test it appears to work perfect but only time can tell. The app is simple which is what i want. It would be nice to be able to name specific workouts for better tracking purpose. The interface on the Moto 360 Sport is ugly but who cares as i won't be using it for looks. I'll update to either a 5 or a 0 tomorrow depending on results",
        "Great app I really like this app. Easy to use (polar h7) and thank you for fixing the weight issue. That was disturbing. ;) I was wondering though, I like to log my strength and cardio workouts separately. I tried today but it looks like my cardio is gone. When I tried to start up my cardio I do remember it asking me if I wanted to continue my workout. I said cancel but was able to continue. Did I do something wrong or is there no way to have two separate workouts on the same date? Thank you. :)",
        "Only displays BT hrm device address, not name. Thus, if there are lots of BT devices in range, it is impossible to tell which one to connect to. HOW DUMB.  [update]  The developer claims that this is a limitation of Android, but this is not true. I can see my HRM listed in discoverable devices in the Bluetooth settings menu of my phone, but all the app shows is a list of MAC addresses.",
        "Google fit sync works again (without any app updates), stays weird. I got the message that it was unable to connect and that i had to select a different account although no option to select one was given. Anywhoo, stuff works again :)"

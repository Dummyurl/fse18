        "Great app though not sure how to rearrange the cards. No sound with alerts or a way to change the vibration  to indicate it is something urgent.",
        "Well  laid out, very readable.",
        "Description of the Pro features is very misleading:  \"Personalize your weather content with the Aeris Wear Pro upgrade! You'll have access to all 9 of our cards and the ability to customize your card order.\"  Once you upgrade to Pro you still do not have the option to change the first 3 cards. Wish my purchase was still within the refund window...",
        "I do like this App with one exception, the 'Maps' don't work at all, the App just crashes, and has to be restarted. Considering I have the latest top of the range Sony Xperia XZ Premium (although it does not work on the Sony Xperia Z5 either) I wonder how it works at all on lesser spec'd machines.  UPDATE : Having got a reply from the developers today I looked at the app again on my phone, (the above problem was on the phone app) and for some reason (magic ?) it is working perfectly, so I then turned to my Sony Smartwatch 3 (it doesn't run Wear v2 by the way) and it works perfectly on that too.  I must admit I had not checked or used it since I first reported the problem, but all is well now and of course I have now given it the 5 stars it deserves. Thanks to the developer for the reply though - I do feel a little guilty for not checking it before now though although there has been no updates to Aeris, there have been a couple of Android updates, but it still remains a mystery as to why it didn't work initially.",
        "Good app but I wish there was a little more information, like percent chance it'll rain. The radar takes forever to load too",
        "Looks nice, reasonable features.  BUT very suspect why it wants access to contacts and phone though, and it doesn't start without these permissions."

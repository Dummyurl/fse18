        "Great app for personal finance.",
        "Please update it to take auto backup on Google drive please",
        "I had exported my data in CSV format but when I try to import it, I am getting error that CSV file is corrupted. I am not able to import my 2 years data.  Please do something about it. Otherwise its simple and neat application. Giving 3 star due to this issue only.     Updates (7-Nov-17): I wish it has option for repeat expenses. I need to move to other app due to this missing feature.  Please add repeat expenses feature and improve export and import even if its paid.  Updates (10-Nov-17): Thanks a lot for response. Now i can say its perfect and simple app. Hats off to the team for developing such a useful app that too without any adds.",
        "Love it! Clean, simple, and easy to use. I use tags to simulate accounts now (like Cash, Credit, etc) would be nice if Accounts could be more formally supported. This way I don't have to check new tag/uncheck old tag when marking the expense account",
        "Excellent.... I use this application for last three years.... It's really fantastic and much helpful too",
        "Great app, no bloat at all."

        "This helps allot because I have to take a cab an hour away from my house, especially with all these horror story's about cab/Lyft/Uber ect.,  drivers/passengers raping and killing. So it puts us at ease a bit. And it's shows where your exact location. This is also perfect if you have kids who have their own phone and you want to keep track of where they are are going.",
        "Swipe up control at bottom of screen doesn't drag up while tracking a Glympse. Or it eventually does but it takes a while trying -- Notification of a location share comes hours late, or usually just after I've stopped watching a user. -- And that has to be the ugliest widget in the Android universe.",
        "This app needs a HISTORY of the entire traveled route.  It leaves a icon to \"tap to view Glympse  history\" that shows nothing but the user's last location when the Glympse expired (ex. parked in the drive way).  It needs to leave the user's full PATH during the course of the Glympse session.  A 'history' showing where they finally stopped after hours of traveling is useless.",
        "I used this app when I drove home to visit from San Francisco to Omaha. Mostly so it wouldn't be hard to find my body when we crashed over a cliff. Thankfully it never came to that. But I was able to keep a live feed almost the whole time. Great app üëçüëç",
        "Almost perfect - my wife and I use it frequently to track our separate journeys home.  The only downside is that it appears to keep running when the journey has finished, eating up resources.  I haven't found any way to exit cleanly and stop, so I have to force close the app in settings.",
        "Using this app while driving to send location and location provided was not accurate. Showed coming from tree line then sharp turn onto roadway while maintaining vehicle on roadway the entire time. Disappointed that while trying to confirm location, the app gave inaccurate information."

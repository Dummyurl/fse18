        "Great idea - bad implementation. I did informed app developers about some issues with their scripts but they doesn't want to acknowledge it. They instead try to convince me that the information will show up some time... this week or next or next year. Other than that is great app. Unfortunately they do NOT listen. 2 stars for this.",
        "EDIT: New update with fhe same old news: no \"Brazil Cup\" tables avaliable!  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Regarding \"Brazil Cup\", it started yesterday (Jan-31) but app only tells \"No Tables Available\" ... ah, come on !?!?",
        "Just before the real and only World Cup start, the app crashes on start :-) ah well, poop happens :-)",
        "Definitely my number one source to keep myself updated with whatever that has to do with football! Easy 5 stars",

        "Useful, but a bit frustrating...  Why, when an app is removed, doesn't it say -which- app got removed...?",
        "Perfect Excellent works as described. @ Erik make sure your watch is connected to your phone. Otherwise you will get \"no apps installed\" message",
        "Very useful. Nice to have on my watch letting me stay up to date without having to check my phone.",
        "Perfect ! Perfect app for separating Android Wear apps and my regular phone apps , so i can uninstall apps safely"

        "I was interested in the Android Wear function, but not good at present. Gpx track imported OK, but not much use with no background map. Also GPS didn't hold lock - normally ok on the watch, but not with this so overall pretty poor.",
        "This app gives access to openstreetmap map worldwide. Unfortunately not opencyclemap which is most useful for cycllists.  No other layers either.   In most respects atlogis apps are better.  The New Zealand one gives nz maps plus open x maps worldwide.  Atlogis gives more flexibility for map downloads.  Sitytrail France is excellent for its IGN maps of Framce."

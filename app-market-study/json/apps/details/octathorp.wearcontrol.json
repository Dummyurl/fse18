        "Needs set on boot Great app,would be a 5 star rating if the governor controls could be set on boot. (Not sure if they are now, I'm assuming not since there isn't an option to tick)",
        "Reboot to recovery do not work On my LG G watch R, that function don't work, that make me feel that the \"powersave\" mode do not work at all too.",
        "Good concept, but it does not seem to take. I run AIDA64 to verify and it still shows the governor to be ondemand, even when I set it to Powersave. I am using the multi-cores (enabled through IntersectRaven's kernels).  Will update my review if this is fixed.",
        "Not bad of an app, needs more options needs a (regular) reboot system option, definitely run at boot opt is a good idea to have, maybe some extra cpu/gpu, kernel/system Tweaks/options?",
        "First app I downloaded after rooting my LG G Watch Like SetCPU for the watch",
        "Good app but reboot commands are not working for me but i think it's on my side!"

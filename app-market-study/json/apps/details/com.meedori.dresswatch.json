        "for some reason it isnt showing in my android wear app or on my watch (moto 360 1st gen) if u fix i give 5star cos these watchfaces look realy cool",
        "The weather still rarely displays correctly for my location, but besides that its my main watch face.",
        "Great faces! Works great. Just a few slow downs during animations, other than that is great. A few more face designs won't hurt. Thanks guys!!!",
        "Great concept but no way to actually set the face Edit: figured out how to set the watch.  When downloading fresh, notification will appear on watch if you want to install. Otherwise, it cannot be found on Android Wear play store.",
        "Awesome watch face! Love changing the colors to match what I am wearing.",
        "Ok but fix weather Weather is not updating and doesn't show the correct temperature information. Good app, but needs to be fixed."

        "Not working on Moto 360 Seems like a fun game, but unfortunately it's seems like it's not compatible with the Moto 360, it rotates 90 degree counter clockwise on star, then moves off the center of the screen so no buttons can be pressed... Please Fix...",
        "Awsome game! Here's a cool idea: you could make it so that when you press play you can choose what mini game you want instead of the game going through the games. Good luck on your game!",
        "Stuck sideways on moto 360",
        "Fun Gameplay I bought one, now buying all the games you guys have done. Fun on my Samsung Gear Live!. I was getting fed up just counting my steps all day. Lots of fun mini games. Love the slipper!",
        "Please update For use with the moto 360. Thanks!"

        "Nicely done! Very nice concept. You can release version two with some new features like Save that picture, back camera option, some fun stuff like scare :p  Also if you have it on  xda, give me source, I could help :)",
        "Great idea had a few issues to start with but the developer quickly addressed those, an option to save the pic would be the next step",
        "Ok Save photo and auto rotate depending on device orientation would make this perfect. I'd even pay for it.",
        "Good idea Doesn't work on my LG G watch and HTC M8.",
        "Did not load Have Moto 360... It didn't load on watch and only fc on my phone",
        "So funny! This app is amazing, just PLEASE add an option to save the picture! Thank you!"

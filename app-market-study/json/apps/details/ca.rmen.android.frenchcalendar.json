        "Running on a Galaxy Tab S, I cannot figure out how to open the widget as widget ... no matter what I do, the app opens full-page in white on black. Not a resizable widget as announced. Help?  Thanks for the help ... I HD forgotten how to do that.",
        "It would be a good idea to choose different fonts.",
        "Never mind. I uninstalled, then re-installed and got it working and it's great. Exactly what I was looking for. It even had a decimal clock, so didn't need to download one of those as well. I can now pretend to my heart's content our time system made some natural sense, and I love that.",
        "True to its content No special permissions, no extra data collection. A simple app that does a simple thing: remind you of days long past, where ideals were more than that.",
        "Vive la republique! This calendar is much more logical and systematic, than our.",
        "Trop cool Très utile et unique, je l'aime beaucoup! Une chose, c'est possible d'ajouter une option de choisir un style plus minimaliste, comme celui de l'horloge défaut? Juste une version sans rôle et avec une autre fonte? Merci beaucoup, en tout cas :)"

        "Please add option to type in events Works like a charm but events must be dictated in by voice. Please add a keypad option to do this. Would then rate 5/5. Running on Huawei watch.",
        "please add support to type with flickkey keyboard",
        "Turns on automatically after notifications This app looks great and I was particularly excited about the keypad for adding new events. The problem is that it turns on after I receive any notifications to my LG G Watch R, regardless of what kind of  notification I get. It also just turns on for no reason and shines at full brightness... It makes the app almost unusable if it keeps turning on by itself.",
        "I like the functions and the app itself, but the font just kills it for me, hence only 3 stars. Please add the ability to switch to a different font, a lot of people already requested it."

        "Hello!  This looks like a fantastic app.  I am not able to send a match to my phone.  I touch the \"Send to Phone\" link.  Then I confirms that it will overwrite existing matches on the phone.  Then it gives a message at the bottom that it is moving the match to the phone.  But...nothing shows up on my phone.  I am using a Polar m600, which I believe comes with Android Wear 2.0.  I am able to get other apps to work.  (Nevermind ...I just figured it out)  With Android Wear 2.0, the user needs to manually install the app on the watch in the Google Play app once it's already on your android phone.  Request...I'd still like to be able to add player numbers on the fly on the phone in case a player arrives after kickoff.",
        "Of all the apps I've tried, this is by far the easiest to use for referees. Does everything I need. And the price is right!",
        "Awesome app üòç Best out there for capturing match data. I even love using it for casual matches with friends!",
        "Hi guys i went to use the app on the weekend and I ran into a problem when I turned off record substitution. I had a message pop up to confirm the teams have the same starting numbers and could not figure out how to fix this",
        "Looks really useful, but a few things could really improve it:  Cancel/End match early (thanks for letting me know how to do this) Add Interchange option for lower level games (i.e. let players subbed off be able to sub back on)  Haven't been able to really test yet don't have watch but looks promising",
        "The first game it worked perfectly. The tournament match it froze multiple times and froze my phone. I am on a Pixel."

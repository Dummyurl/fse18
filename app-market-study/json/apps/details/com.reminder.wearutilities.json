        "Great idea, needs polish Sharing text will bring up this app as an option, but sharing an image does not. The image picture inside the app doesn't show all available image sources. Also, the image sent to the device winds up looking very pixelated. Showing ads as part of a share action is obnoxious. Please offer a paid version if you are going to do that.",
        "Does nothing but popup ads Says text sent to watch, but doesn't do it.  Popup ads are full screen - as annoying as possible.  Should be called 'Annoying Ads for Wear'."

    "description": "The aim of this game is to simulate a waterfall using numbers. The waterfall is considered well-formed only if:- The sum of the numbers that form the waterfall is equal to the goal.- The marked numbers should be adjacent horizontal, vertical and diagonally. That is, there is no empty line union.- There are 2 numbers marked on each row.Also available a challenges section, where different challenges and variations of the game appear. In both cases, there are two levels: normal and difficult. In the normal level, the sum of the waterfall numbers is shown, however, in the difficult level, you will have to sum them mentally because it disappears.Challenges:- 15s countdown- 30s countdown- 6 hidden cells- Random numbers- Negative numbers- Pair numbers- Odd numbers- Multiples of 10Sum and subtract. Sharpen up your mind.This game is compatible with Android Wear",

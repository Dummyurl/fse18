        "I like the app all around, my only concern is Everytime I try to add or edit an event through my watch it says failed. Always. I've rrsest my phone and watch and unistalled on both devices and reinstalled. Sadly still doesn't work properly",
        "Great for making events and being reminded straight from my watch. You don't even need your phone, which is awesome. It's also very snappy and efficient.",
        "This is a very good app. Unlike the system app, I can see my calendar for multiple days even when the phone is disconnected. I would like to see different colors for the different calendars.",
        "Location map doesn't work. Tapping the map tries to navigate to 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude, which is in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "Cannot show whole month on one screen without personal info only calendar, complicated micro payments options, should be one price for all.",

        "Easy to use, fun and especially like the usage chart to track the different beverage varieties you've created for month.   Need to fix the \"Espresso\" option please as it doesn't allow you to bookmark this particular one! No issues with bookmarking any of the other flavours.",
        "Stupid qn perhaps but do we start the timer the moment we push the start button, or the precise moment coffee begins to flow from the machine? Please clear this up for us. Thank you",
        "Luv my Jovia only negative is not all varieties available in New Zealand have to purchase ones like Caramel M on ebay",
        "Looks good, tastes good.  Plenty of varieties.... look out for bargain pods in outlets like Poundland.  The drinks timer app is excellent too.",
        "Sirve para lo que esta diseñado, se pega cuando el telefono se bloquea, pero cumple su función.",
        "A brilliant app easy to use  ☕ love my new nescafe dolce gusto ☕"

        "Times are based on the size of each capsule. If you find it more convenient, you can also use the timer by level, which follows the time recommended by the manufacturer."

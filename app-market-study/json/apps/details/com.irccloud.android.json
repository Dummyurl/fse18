        "Why i cannot login to my account? It keep saying not connect to irc cloud?",
        "i always choose this irc client over the rest because it's simple get has way more features* i use it connect to my own znc with paid app.",
        "I just lost everything because of your app",
        "As an irc client it is working great, but that would not necessarily require a sign-up. But since it also gives you a bouncer that's whats makes it worth it for me (2 hours for free, 5$/month for unlimited time). Very recommended.",
        "This is a paid service. I like the convenience and the stable easy to use clients. It ain't irssi so don't expect that."

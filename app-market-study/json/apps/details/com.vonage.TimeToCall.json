        "This app was great.... until they hit you with recharge credit. I had had the app for nearly 4 years with free calling. But now Like a prepaid service you must now pay for minutes.. Trash. We download vonage because it's free. Now it's just went into the garbage can of the app store for greed. 1 star if you agree.",
        "The best app I've ever download. Really useful in my situation. I had no way of reaching my fiance but then I found this app, and was really very thankful that it actually works, no false advertising like the rest. Sorry for the poor rating , I give this app a ðŸ’¯. Thanks alot.",
        "Need help I have been using this app past few years and its excellent but past 2 days it started giving me a lot of trouble. I am not able to make calls and if somehow connected then not at all able to disconnect. Its just getting hang everytime. Any help will be highly appreciated.",
        "Idk what happened but now when I try to sign into the app it says it's the wrong password. I sign in online it's works just fine. Will canceling service if I can't see it on my phone",
        "I will rewrite my review if called back or email.toward my 6 complaining calls and sorry but good bye and hello is NJ way of state is cutting you off. So training of what and how to used to who and when is another problem one esglaisted I hope done. Thank you and I teach them but ask my education level. Let's prove there's",
        "Its okay Half the time whether on Wifi or LTE it won't connect. Other times it tells me I don't have enough credits for FREE calls. But, when it does finally work, good call quality."

        "Works great! The only things I would change is 1, make the quantity keyboard use numbers for easier entry and 2, show the number of an items overall (included on all lists) so if I have two lists that contain eggs, it would show the overall count I need. Other than that it makes keeping shopping lists a breeze.",
        "Use it all the time This works for me and I use it to prepare my shopping lists. That green tick that shows when I have finished and all items are accounted for I give to you - consider it my tick of approval.",
        "Handy Dandy, I like the fact that I can start my list and get it on my watch and stays on while I shop. Better than getting my phone out. Thanks!",
        "Love. Would be nice if marked items auto move to bottom of list",

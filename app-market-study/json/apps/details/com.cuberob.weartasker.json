        "The app works fine for what it advertises: launch a tasker task from your watch. It seems to sync your favourites and folders every time you launch it on the watch however which gives running any task a 5-6 second delay. Is there any way you can speed that up? Wear 2.0 devices tend to have plenty of space for storing data so I'm not sure why it syncs each time...",
        "*update* After purchasing premium and setting up a complication I can no longer get the app to work, constantly getting connectivity errors. Doesn't seem very stable *end update* Tasker shortcuts as watchface complications work as expected, but I wish you could modify the name and icon. All tasks use the default icon and uses the Tasker name as the label, would be nice to change.",
        "I'm having the same trouble as Anton.  I can place multiple complications on a face and they will have their correct names, but the buttons will all trigger the same (most recently placed) task.  A second, minor, issue: complications are only showing the default \"lightning bolt\" icon, despite an icon having been selected in Tasker and in WearTasker.",
        "Worked once, now says \"No connection\". Might work again after reboot, but frankly, not worth it...",
        "Great job with wear widgets, super handy! But a have a bug with widgets, all of them have different names, but trigger the same task - last one chosen.",
        "Never got it to work, kept giving me \"no connection\" error on the watch, even though watch is connected (as reported in wear app), and other apps on watch have connection to phone."

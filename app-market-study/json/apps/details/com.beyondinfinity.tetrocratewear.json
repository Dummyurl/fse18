        "A good and solid game, BUT... ... Get rid of the plus shaped blocks. It doesn't matter how good you are or how good you're doing, the plus shaped blocks will abruptly end your game, even if you still had so much opportunity to go on. The plus block requires way too much space, and unless you're at the start of true game, it's a death sentence for your hand to have it appear at ANY time after the start.",
        "Well made,  but weak execution Really not a bad idea,  and visually one of the better Android Wear games out there,  but please,  change to standard block shapes instead of the ridiculous shaped currently used.",
        "Best game! Hands down my favorite game for android wear, helps get me through those boring meetings!",
        "Fun little game! Great way to waste some time and a bit more difficult than it looks! So much fun!",

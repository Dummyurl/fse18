        "Awful. I paid for the app to get all the farts. It keeps telling me on the watch I need to pay. Daylight robbery. Do not buy. It's ridiculous. Definitely a scam.",
        "Bought all 9 but not syncing all to my motorcycle 360 Only normal is working,  but my phone app says I bought them all. How long does it take to sync all 9? I paid for the app,  phone confirmed I paid,  but moto 360 still says I have to pay.? Fix it please or return my money.   Marco",

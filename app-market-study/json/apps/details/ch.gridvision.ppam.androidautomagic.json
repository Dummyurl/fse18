        "UPDATE: After months of performing flawlessly, since the last update, none of my flows are working any more. They're fine if i manually 'Execute' them, but they're no longer firing automatically.  PREVIOUS: I wanted to create a simple script which would set my phone's screen lock to use a PIN when I was at home and a password  when I was elsewhere. Having previously tried Tasker and Automate; both of which seemed only to offer the option to enable/disable screen locking entirely, I didn't hold out much hope for this lesser known alternative. But the reviews were encouraging and I thought I'd give it a go. 15 mins later and *Hooray!* I now have a phone which uses a simple PIN no. at home (I still want some privacy!) and automatically switches to a stronger password when I'm away from home. UPDATE: I reinstalled the Qpython plugin and Automagic picked it up the second time. So all good now and another star added.",
        "I started to use this as a replacement for good old Llama. It could be alright but the location based triggers still don't work every time (even though it is set to 'modern'), periodic timer is unreliable a lot of times and the app started to crash/close a lot lately although it is set to protected in Android and should be always running. As excited I was when I bought it, that disappointed I am now 😐",
        "Hands down the most useful app on my phone.  Mute calls/volume at work, log battery level to check rate of discharge, find my phone flow- most features I wish my phone had I've been able to make!  The developer's response to user questions is exemplary- Martin is very involved.",
        "Really great app. Using it with mi band tools, sleep as Android and DI.fm radio.    I have created 3 pretty involved flows. One that watches sleep as Android sleep start. Then posts a status bar notification that mi band tools reads and changes mi band to continus heart rate monitoring.   In the morning sleep as Android alarm fires silently. Automagic kicks off di.fm radio with some conditional loops.  Adjusts volume with slow raise.    Once I stop sleep as Android. Automagic then stops di.fm from playing as well as closing the app and adjusting a few things back to my preference.  All without root.   I will say non root did make some of the things I want a little more complex but I was still able to mostly achieve my goals.  One thing I am concerned about is since I am using  accessibility functions. These will most likely be broken once Google pulls. Apps that allow this.  :(",
        "I *wanted* to like it, wanted it to replace AutomateIt. But so many of the goes don't seem to actually work. \"Turn off Bluetooth when device is disconnected\" for example, does nothing. \"Toggle WiFi when arriving/leaving home\" - nada. I'm disappointed.",
        "How do I get rid of the double service notifications on my Google Pixel? I have one that doesn't show up in the bar unless I pull it down (I'm ok with this one) and a second one that displays an icon all the time."

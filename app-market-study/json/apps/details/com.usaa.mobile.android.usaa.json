        "Nor updating to the 2/22/2018 version due to all the complaints. +USAA, we expect actual update notes with each release, unique to each release, but just a blanket \"we're always updating...\" that's what scammers do.  You're our BANK!  You have a responsibility to tell us what we're installing on our personal devices.",
        "Just realized that I can no longer save confirmation of transfers committed via mobile. A \"Save\" button is present, but it does nothing. It's bad enough that we can't save screenshots, and now I can't export the image via the app's facilities. Is this USAA's fix to not being able to export multiple confirmations to the same directory due to having the same file name? Ugh... If it's not one thing, it's another...",
        "If you like a spinning white circle around a USAA logo, this is the app for you! Otherwise it is worthless for paying bills.  How many people have to tell USAA this app is broken before you fix it? Like others are posting, it is so slow now.  I can no longer pay bills since the \"pay\" screen will not load.  On occasion it will load but the accounts drop down is blank...  Pretty much non functional...",
        "I used to use this app a lot, but haven't been able to get past the login screen for a while, as the circle just spins until the screen times out. I am super disappointed, and it sounds like so are a lot of other users. I wish USAA would listen and fix this app.",
        "I used to be able to do all my online banking using the app. now I am unable to do much more than view my account balances, if that. often I get an error message! if ever it does work properly, it's incredibly slow.",
        "Zelle was a good feature, but now it doesn't work. Screen just keeps buffering. How many people need to complain before it is fixed?"

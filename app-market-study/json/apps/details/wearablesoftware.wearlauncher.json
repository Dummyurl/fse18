        "Great concept, lots of room for potential! First off, I love that it doesn't take over my watch face choice or anything else. It just adds an app drawer that you open by swiping from the left which did nothing before.  I hope to see the UI work much more smoothly & responsive in the upcoming updates, and perhaps some customization options after that: such as icon size, options for number of columns, show/hide app titles, maybe make the top bar scrollable & customizable with favorite apps? It's a great app! Looking forward to what's to come!",
        "Using for 3 days now; would be great to be able to configure what icons are displayed. Also it would be great to have a timeout feature, so the launcher hides after a configurable duration of inactivity. Found that any other apps that require swiping from the left of the screen conflicts with bubble launcher, would be great if this could detect if another app is open and disable itself.",
        "Swiping is difficult and doesn't close quickly Takes at least 3 swipes to open the drawer. Same thing with closing the drawer. Clicking the side button puts the watch in ambient mode, but the launcher stays open. So, there's no way of escaping the tedious process of selecting the exact, small region for xlosing the drawer.",
        "Top right blue /white settings gear wheel icon not work. Top centre double white square busts gives a grey screen. Unable to find location despite android location set to on ..GPS+wifi. I hope there is an update soon as I bought licence. Sent two emails requesting assistance but no replies!",
        "Dirty liars!!! I hate apps who LIE to their customers. They didn't mention anywhere about it being a trial version or that you have to buy anything, but after a couple days of use the app stops working and requires your to buy it to continue using it. Stay off these dirty liars!",
        "So how do I purchase the full app? And explain properly, not just it's in the app. You clearly are not concerned with customer care are you? We are just after a clear way of purchasing your product?"

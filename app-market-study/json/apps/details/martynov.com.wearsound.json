        "Saved my phone! My phones volume buttons stopped working and this simple solution makes the volume very easy to control again. Thank you VERY much developer for putting this together!!",
        "Works with Chromecast! When I'm streaming music from Google Play to my TV and Speakers through Chromecast, this Wear App automatically controls the desired volume target, so I can walk around the house and turn up/down the volume even from another room",
        "It works as advertised Please consider spelling control right on the phone part of the app, seems like a strange thing to get wrong.",

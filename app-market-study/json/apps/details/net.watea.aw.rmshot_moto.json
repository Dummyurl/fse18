        "It's a cool app, works perfect for me. Has a little lag but I have a moto 360 (1st gen).. It take getting use to becuase you can flip the screen sideways or use the front camera. I have not tried the zoom yet. But all in all its a pretty good app.",
        "Would give it 5 if video recording was possible. Otherwise, great app",
        "Really nice buuuuut... This app will be 5* if you just and the ability to have a custom file path! That's a huge drawback that it can only save to 2 predefined locations",
        "Love the app. It would just be nice to be able to save to the SD card.",

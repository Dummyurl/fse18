        "Good app, one flaw on Moto 360 I was hoping for an app like this on my watch. Very convenient. The only problem is that the button at the bottom of the screen is cut off on the Moto 360 due to the \"flat tire.\" Still usable, and still cool. If you need a simple chord ref for your phone, then this is a good choice.",
        "Really handy app for an intermediate guitar player!"

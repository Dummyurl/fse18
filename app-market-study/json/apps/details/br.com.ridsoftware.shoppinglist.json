        "I'm not a big fan of the newest update but it's still the best shopping app out there. The pictures make all the difference so that instead of seeing \"Milk\" on the list, you can see exactly what milk to get. The new round photos though are a problem. Most of my stuff comes in square boxes rather than round ones (except a few cheeses) and I get messed in the store up trying to find the round box of Cheerios. ;)   Sync between devices is perfect (and automatic) so I'll give it the sixth star.",
        "This is the first time I installed this shopping and found out that we can add items to the database but we  can't search for pictures online. What a shame. So only 3 stars",
        "Easy to use and very useful.",
        "It's almost perfect! Shame it doesn't allow you to delete multiple grocery items from the main list,  as it comes with a presaved list full of items I would never purchase, so I have to go through and individually select each one and delete! Would be so much easier if you could select multiple items to delete at a time",
        "Easy to use as a shopping list...cart price included.",
        "really DISLIKE the update.  Being able to EDIT items AS YOU ADD THEM TO YOUR LIST was why I liked it.  It's such a PAIN IN THE ASS. Entirely why I left Listonic."

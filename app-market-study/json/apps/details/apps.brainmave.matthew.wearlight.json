        "Handy, needs brightness override This is a really handy app. I have used my watch as a flashlight for a while now. But now being able to stay \"open flashlight\"  is so much easier. I only wish that this had a way of automatically overriding with brightness to brightest or even having a brightness toggle or slider. Thanks for the cool app.",

        "Straightforward and it works, but... It would get 5 stars if it turned up the device's brightness as well. (And turned it back to the previous setting on exit). Without this you may as well just go to the launch menu with a tap and swipe."

        "This app use to be my favorite. But for some reason with a recent update my live wallpaper for this app doesn't work. Why can't I customize this like I use to be able to. I have paid so much for gomo app team on several apps.",
        "I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND IT DIDN'T WORK. NOW WHAT? I PURCHASED FULL USE OF THE WHOLE APP, MARCH 4, 2016. IT WAS $18.99 THEN. I HAD BOUGHT PRO VERSION BEFORE THAT FEBRUARY 21, 2016. I had to reinstall the app and it wants me to pay for it again. I had the super vip. Now what?",
        "Garbage. In order to get the entire benefits/range (10 day forecast etc.) you either have to pay or download other apps you don't want. I just want weather. Many other options for free and no hassles out there. Uninstalling!",
        "UNINSTALLED! After they added DU Quick Charge that tried to replace my lock screen with ads and take over other settings. Never was an awesome app, and this update turned it into malware. NO! I don't need that headache.",
        "Location is Hanoi, Vietnam. In one day usage i found it's not accurate. AccuWeather shows 21° weather in Hanoi & go weather shows 18° and feel like 19° which is not accurate (i refreshed both). Uninstalling it.",
        "Eats battery! Radar doesnt load. no weather map representation. no color representations on graphs. Expensive."

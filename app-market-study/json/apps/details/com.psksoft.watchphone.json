        "like it! responsive. colorful. no errors.   and what I like most: it's the first dialer that let me search in contacts (using speech). cool.   Alexander, good job!     May I suggest you if possible to enhance:  I start the call from watch. My bluetooth hands-free is in my ear. On watch, the bluetooth sign is on the blue button bottom right. I start to push the button. bluetooth &gt; phone speaker &gt; phone earpiece &gt; phone speaker &gt; phone earpiece &gt; .... so I do not have the possibility to came back on hands-free device.  also the status of the used device on the phone display  does not change. the phone will continue to show bluetooth is used, even I'm already on speaker or earpiece.  samsung s6 and LG watch R both on 5.1.1.  10x!  robert",
        "I really wanted to like this app. But.   It simply doesn't work on my Moto 360. It's either frozen or dials a completely random number.   I don't like to ask for a refund as you seem a really decent guy, but unfortunately it just doesn't work - and I've tried all the troubleshooting steps you've suggested in these feedback responses.",
        "Nice app, better than the other watch dialers I tried. Two questions though: - is there a way for it to provide a keypad *during* a call? (I have a feeling the answer is \"no\" due to API limitations.) - on a long call, the screen eventually \"times out\". Is there a control for how long this takes?",
        "Messed up with incoming calls After installing this app, it is working fine for outgoing calls but it is not allowing to take incoming calls. I am using Nexus 6 and moto 360 2nd gen. Also during incoming calls my phone ringtone is not playing, as if it is in silent mode.",
        "I'd give 4 but it doesn't stay open I wanted the ability to mute my calls through my watch as I'm often on calls whilst moving and hate having repeatedly to take the phone out to control the mute.  This app does exactly that even if you started the call on the phone. The bad news is that the app dissappears shortly after starting it, if I've started it by hand it should stay open until I swipe it closed. Fix that and it's a clear 4, making the mute button the biggest on the screen an easy 5.(FYI I have not used any other functions of the app)",
        "This app is honestly one of the reasons I started looking at Smartwatches in the first place. When I found out I can mute/unmute a call in-progress from my wrist without having to take my phone out of my pocket, unlock the screen, and change windows to get back to the phone app, I knew that I needed to have it.  I spend a lot of time on conference calls so being able to quickly and easily mute/unmute my mic is vital.  What's also real nice is it doesn't seem to matter if I start or answer the call from the phone, the app, or \"OK Google\".    The only problem, and that keeps me from giving a 5th star, is that I can't for the life of me figure out how to get back to the call-in-progress screen if I leave the app on my watch.  I was just in a call a few minutes ago, received some notifications from other apps during the call, and tried to return back to Watch Phone, but couldn't control the ongoing call anymore.  This functionality, if it exists, doesn't seem to be very intuitive."

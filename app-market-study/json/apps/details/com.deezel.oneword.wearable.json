        "This is it! I've been looking everywhere for an app that allows me to freely read the Word without giving me only a verse at a time not of my choosing. This is absolutely perfect! Now we just need more translations :)",
        "Great! Just one thing font size if it were the next size larger it will be a 5 star app my eyes aren't what they used to be. Bless You for making this app for Android wear.",
        "Woow!!!!  What can i say? This is an excellent work, thank God for your efforts Developer.... This is a very good job, may God grant you the grace even to do more to His Glory.....     This a good app, well there is something missing in the book of John, there are missing scriptures, like in the book of John 3:, John 4, all  need to be updated , because they are ending on the 21st Verse but in the actual sense, they go beyond.",
        "A True Blessing It's a true Blessing 2 have the Bible on my smartwatch. It great encouragement when I'm @ work. I pray 2 see more apps like this. God bless.",

        "Worst app ever. Got blocked out of my account for no reason and they didn't even let me know. It is impossible to unblock it and every method of trying to unblock it just leads to another dead end. Nobody uses this stupid app!! Avoid at all costs, it sucks!!",
        "Hello WeChat team, I cannot login to my account since im using a new device and it need me to verify it through my friends. But I didn't know any of my friendlist on this app and it is almost 1year I uninstalled this app. Please help me I need to use this fun app again. üò≠",
        "I like the idea, has a lot of interesting features. Hate the 'system maintenance' which happens whenever something screwy happens in china, or any anniversary or something happens in china. Not a big fan of being monitored by the ccp either.",
        "i want to rate this as five..but too bad i can't use the payment.  it was only in mainland china  i hope they can access it to Philippine so when i order goods from china i can pay easier..  a big hope.. keep it up WECHAT üòòüòâ",
        "People nearby, radar, throw bottle & shake feature didn't work. Plus, other user can't added me even i have wechat ID. They're can't find me on people nearby & by contact numbrt at all even after i try to fix the problem for twice. So disappointed with your apps",
        "i am very unsatisfied with this app. i was trying to add a friend into a group but all of a sudden i wasnt able to,the reason being that i have violated wechat regulations in on of my post. however i have posted the same post in another group and that group did not have such an issue. please address this problem as quick as possible and i will give this app 5 stars."

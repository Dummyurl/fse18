        "So simple. I tried a number of similar apps but they are unnecessarily complicated and even then they didn't do what I wanted.  This app enables me to pull down the most used settings no matter what screen I'm on.  Especially useful when using Maps in the car and I need to quickly brighten the screen for example without having to  come out of Maps.  WiFi or WiFi settings and Bluetooth or Bluetooth settings options are really useful. Other apps have the Bluetooth and Wifi options but not the settings.  I had to uninstall and reinstall it on my new phone as initially it just wasn't showing but it now works perfectly.",
        "$_Awesome Highly Recommended, A reason I like this app, Always doing Updates, that is a good sign developers cares. Other apps are really Goooooood, then overnight they are gone, something that you bought. Disappears.",
        "I've used this app for years. It's the best. Works every time. Never a problem. Set up a system or app shortcut. Arrange them on the line and in the order you want. And you have instantly available shortcuts to your favorite apps.",
        "Notification gets collapsed all the time, no matter what level of priority is set to, and the toggles are now very inconvenient to use. Any fix coming soon?",
        "Super handy. I use this every day. It doesn't take up a lot of space, responsive, clean look. I recommend this!",
        "Avoid this aggravating headache! A waste of time setting up after failing or disappearing 5+ times. Spyware? Malware? Not sure. App is once again acting goofy again...6th time. Replacing it with \"fooView\" app. This works for me."

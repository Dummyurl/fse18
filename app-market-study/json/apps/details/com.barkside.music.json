    "description": "Control your favourite mobile music player from your watch.Provides more features and a smarter user-interface than the stock controller, and is compatible with more music players.  It also features a brand-new music watch face.This app works for a TRIAL period of 4 days, after which you must PURCHASE the LICENSE from within the mobile app.A watch app, and supporting watch notifications enable you to perform these functions: Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Volume-Up, Volume-Down. The experimental Play... function allows you to play in any supported App, or start a Playlist.There is also a choice of user interfaces: Sparse for use when running and walking; Compact for use otherwise.  There is also a Voice Command option for use when driving or cycling, allowing you to speak commands to skip track, start a playlist, or decrease volume etc. For example, just say \"OK Google; Start Music Controller\", and then \"Turn it up\".  The full-screen notification can be changed to a card from the phone settings.HOW TO USE:1) ENABLE NOTIFICATION LISTENING PERMISSION from phone.2) Play music!The watch app can be started manually, or by voice: \"Ok Google, Start Music Controller\" (note: using voice commands will stop your music temporarily!).  Song title and artist information is shown, where available.  Album artwork is shown where available for users of KitKat and above, JB users only for music stored on mobile.  Track progress information, plus other extended information such as BPM is shown where available.This has been confirmed to work on Android stock music player, Google Music Player, Rocket Player, PlayerPro, SoundCloud (sometimes - best to use My Cloud Player), MediaMonkey, doubleTwist, Spotify, Music Unlimited, jetAudio, Audible, ChromaDoze, Shuttle, PowerAmp (album art only when phone screen is on), VLC, BBC iPlayer Radio, Sonos Controller, Podcast Republic, Podcast & Radio Addict, Pocket Casts.  Other music players, audio-book players, white-noise generators etc may or may NOT work, so please check before purchasing the license.  Some music players have their own notifications, which will show up alongside ones from this app (some can be muted from the Android Wear App). Sometimes a different media player may start up when playing from the watch if you have multiple players installed.The stock Android Wear Music Card may show up as well, and CANNOT be dismissed/hidden.  This is a limitation of Android Wear, not this app.  This app attempts to place its card above the standard one for convenience, also by making the notification on-going/persistent. You can close the notification using the Close action button. DON'T use Block App - this will hide this app's notification indefinitely (until you enable again in Android Wear App).This also works with Yatse XBMC remote control, so therefore may work with other remote control apps like Chromecast etc.Advanced settings are available to tweak functionality to support more devices and apps.  Tasker / Locale is also supported for actions such as starting the watch app or notification, or Play..., useful for when Bluetooth headphones/speakers are connected for example.Square and round watches are both supported.  Only Android Wear watches are supported.  This app will NOT play music that is stored on your watch. Limited/no compatibility with Napster or Rhapsody.Want to beta-test up-coming features?

        "Works with Maple JB Player! (except for song info) This is the only Wear music controller I know of that will control Maple JB Player which is the best Android music player (Poweramp does not have playback speed control). Took off one star because you have to swipe left to get to the playback controls. I want the playback controls to appear first without swiping left.",
        "Totally worth spending a couple bucks for an app that fixes the voice control problem.  However, this app only seems to partially fix it (maybe I 'm missing something though).  I'm trying to leave my watch in a \"listening mode\", such that I can just say \"play\", \"pause\", \"ok google play\", \"ok google pause\", or some other phrase that allows me to start/pause my music app (google play music in this case).  The mic button kind of works, but I first have to press the mic button and secondly I have to confirm that what I said is indeed what I meant.  Any hints? :)",
        "No shuffle option? Thanks for the app tho",
        "Only a trial, yea, like I'm gonna pay for this, lol",
        "Good start and pretty good set of features but not yet finished. Doesn't really work with Android Wear 2. I tried Media Monkey and Player Pro, it works sporadically but mostly doesn't. Hope you fix it soon, would be really happy to change my review and actually use the app. Good luck.",
        "Best option out there but still not there 4.5* editing my previous review as I have managed to get it working again with BlackPlayer ex. However it can be very temperamental, when I try to start my music straight from my watch it will play, but then after 1 or 2 seconds it stops and starts the stock player, i have to press the play/pause button 3 or 4 times to stop it and keep playing music on BlackPlayer. Other than that it works like it used to. It also seems to clash with the built in music control on my wear device? As in I have 2 controls on watch"

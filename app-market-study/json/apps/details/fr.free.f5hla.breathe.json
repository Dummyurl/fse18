        "Great but not optimised well Perfect in principle and very similar to Apples version. However, it isn't optimised for round watches, and android just displays a off centre square around it. Some of the animations are not smooth either. I love it but needs some improvement. Should also have some sort of a time limit like others have said, and could deliver notifications when heartbeat was high.",
        "please make it breathe for just 1 minute instead of indefinitely. then it tells me my BPM at the end. also my BPM is too high it says i'm riding high at 110 but in reality my BPM is around 70 according to other apps - cool as a cucumber. please fix.",
        "Great little app Simple and effective"

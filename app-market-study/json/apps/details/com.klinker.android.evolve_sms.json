        "I've always loved evolve sms but I just got a new XZ premium and it has improved on this phone.. I know you have to pay for themeing but it's worth it!! Looks fantastic, feels great.. And if you're too tight to pay the nice developers for there hard work, then you lose out!!! You get what you pay for.. No adverts or anything that pesters you to spend more money.. I love it!! Thank you üòÅüëç",
        "When it works it's great, but when it doesn't, well why have it if it doesn't work, right. Not sure why it just stops receiving texts, sometimes it's because I forget to turn off VPN, stock app works with VPN. But other times it just doesn't work.  Was using it on One Plus 5 stock Hydrogen. Latest is Hydrogen updated to Oreo. Seems to be OK so far with most things, but not changing rating because can't set ringtones. Can select them, but they don't take, at all. Back to stock messaging app for now.",
        "Just about perfect. I love the dark theming.  The live preview widgit is awesome. General UI layout it the best ever. I love swiping between conversations and having the list on the left in portait mode. Powerful tools  I wish this would be able to integrate Facebook messenger where it combines SMS and fb conversations in line like Windows phone 7 used to. That was powerful but fb broke it.  Small UI suggestions: Use parallaxing on elements to give a subtle 3d look. Squish bounce the screen when you scroll to the bottom.  Small usability issues: Sometimes it splits my conversations into two conversations with the same contact. Sometimes it loads photos a little clunky, lag where it has to reload. Textra feels a bit snappier the evolve  By far the cleanest, best overall app on the market! Well worth the money.",
        "On the Moto X4, MMS messages repeatedly get sent to the wrong person, and sending messages disables wifi until I go into Android's settings and turn it back on.   Worked great on my old phone though...",
        "Thank you soon much! I have been having problems with text messages coming in split and out of order. I tried every SMS app imaginable trying to fix . Reset my phone, tried SMS timestamp fix apps. You name it and I tried it! This is the only thing that worked! Forever grateful! You can manually put your carrier info in advance settings. Thanks!",
        "Dec 26 2017 update...  large images send at 161kb?.. just wish the Android Wear Reply would work correctly.. ( only responds to last message conversation.. it just acts like it sends for previous messages )"

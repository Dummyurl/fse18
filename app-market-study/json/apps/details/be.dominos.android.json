        "App is just the mobile website. Sometimes paying online via the app can be a true hassle as it crash/bug/ask to open in another app, just redirect to the website or if you're lucky works as intended.",
        "Could be better The app does not remember Paypal credentials (pizza.be app does it correctly). It always refers to Domino's Pizza Antwerpen Kiel. Very confusing when my address is in Gent.",
        "Good app. Does what it has to. One minor: on crazy Tuesday and Saturday the coupon code is not automatically filled in, and you need to search online to find the code.",
        "brilliant too good too easy .... im buying too much pizza now ðŸ˜†",
        "Wrong address Type street & post code, get right streetname in another postcode halfway across the country, just like the site, broken"

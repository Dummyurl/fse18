Augmented optimizes the information in several ways:Information is more relevant than native alert (whatsapp multiple messages, email body preview etc). For Android Wear Contact picture is shown (even if native alert does not show it).Augmented is highly configurable. Android Wear vibration pulses can be tweak so high priority contacts (independent of which app is used) can vibrate differently on your android wear device. The actual vibration  pulse can be tuned including the number of pulses, duration of pulse and duration between pulses. Vibration can be tailored to specific (types) of apps so one can determine the type/sender of alerts by simple vibration. Many more tweaks of this nature are provided - some are described below and on my web site.TTS is highly tuned. For example, it can be configured to only play a TTS (of an alert) when wearing specific bluetooth headsets (e.g. when running one may use a different headset than when commuting). more info on Enhanced TTS - http://bit.ly/2sD5C6NInfo on S8/S8+ Edge Notification - http://bit.ly/2qXNUsTInfo on Improved Tasker Support - http://bit.ly/2yRqjCuInfo on PixelBook support - http://bit.ly/2xVO5sXNote there is some support for Tesla (if you own one).Please ensure Notification Access for Augmented SmartWatch Pro is granted in Android System Settings.I developed this app for my daily life and it is highly tuned (but configurable). I am open to requests as the app is abstracted for easy customization. Just email me.I have not updated the app for over a year as I did not want to drop support for the older watches.

        "The Sony SW2 watch is just a disappointing but pretty glass slab without this app.  Would not have bought the watch if I didn't find this app first.  Exchange/Office 365 notifications are essential.  The setup UI has a steep learning curve, it's not intuitive.  Worth the effort.  Developer responds quickly.",
        "The app has to stop keeping screen on. It is now becoming a battery killer.   It was an amazing app until this starting happening. Please fix.Would like other integrations with common apps.  Also notifications from this app freezes phone from time to time.   Also interrupts other apps.",
        "No vibration? The app is great and is my essential for smart watch. However, recently it stopped vibrating. Settings seems to be all right. Anyone experienced this?",
        "Now accepting Weather Underground API developer key again.",
        "All works fine after I reinstall this app. Thanks.",
        "Took a little while to setup and is a little quirky at times, but overall it has turned my Sony Smartwatch 2 from a expensive timepiece into an invaluable time saving and notification device with time options!  Being able to place information 'widgits' directly onto the watchface is a great feature so even if I miss a notification I can glance down and see it on the standard watchface.   The rain and weather notifications are extremely useful also!  The only features I'd like to see would be a black/white list for notifications from certain apps (One app I have sends lots of notifications with only a few key words for ones I actually care about), and a way to prevent rapid fire notifications (A cooldown time between notifications or vibrations if they come in fast)."

        "I love it!",
        "This app is so great. I love it. Thank goodness there is no way to put stuff podcasts on your watch. The Bluetooth works very well and I am impressed with the sound quality. It is a little clunky to get podcasts onto the watch, but you can just plug in any RSS URL and it works",
        "Works without flaws. A must have app for android wear. Many thanks to the developer. Feature request: Option to trim silence during podcasts would be great!",
        "Two stars because, yes, it will play podcasts.  There is no basic search function, which renders this next to useless if you cannot find the podcasts you want in the top lists.",
        "Awesome app to send podcasts to my android watch and it automatically downloads new podcasts once added.",
        "Hmmm not sure. I cannot see the app on the Sony Smartwatch3. Tried to send files to the watch but nothing."

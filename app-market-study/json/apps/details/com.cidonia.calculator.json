        "Will not open Every time I try to open it on my Moto 360, it gives me the \"unfortunately, Calculator has stopped\" message. I noticed another review with the same complaint that the developer had replied to, saying they were working to fix this as fast as possible. This reply was left almost a year ago. I'd skip this app if you have a Moto 360. :(",

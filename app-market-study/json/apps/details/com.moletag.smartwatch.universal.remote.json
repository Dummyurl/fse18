        "Great This app is really useful thanks to good wear support. It will get 5 stars when we get vcr & smart controls for tv's",
        "UPDATE Good concept and it works but my frequency is radio. Good app to buy",
        "Awesome app. Worth the money! Awesome app. Please know you must have another app installed and paid for to use this app. But when you have it, this app works great and is super easy to set up.  One feature request: Could you add a full page number keypad as one of the custom screens? I would love to be able to flick to a custom page on y watch that has all 10 numbers and a select button.",
        "Moto360 w/HTC One Max.. nice! Nice addition for us Android Wear Smart Watch folks. Thanks for making my Moto360 even more functional.",
        "Top-notch Dev support!",
        "Very good application This is a very good application but as I have been led to understand the app uses the IR port in the phone so unless your phone NOT watch has an IR port then don't try this application. If your phone does however have the IR port then this is a really nice easy app to use."

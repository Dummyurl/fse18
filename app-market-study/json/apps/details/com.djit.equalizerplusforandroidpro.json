        "Very good app. Sometimes it crashes but not often. Also I have an idea of improvement, when the view is the spinning disk, touching it stop the spin and pause the music, that's great but can you make it even better? E.g. when turning the disk (backward or forward), it does the same in the music, depending on the speed of the turn, it can go faster...",
        "I have written to you guys about this app...  I have paid for the app twice just to get it to work.. £8.38 and now,  it literally crashed my tablet.  The only option is to do a factory reset.  PLEASE REFUND ASAP....",
        "There is definitely a problem with the bass lever and booster. Maybe not boosting the right frequencies. Also it would be really good if you add a left right balance lever.",
        "I was instantly hooked, trying out the free version. I dug it enough to the point that I didn't mind spending the $2-$3 and change. Awesome features, love the \"extra bass\" booster, the gradual blend of tracks when songs are changing, so easy to use..... Look I could go on and on but, there's no point, just try it,😉",
        "I'm using LG G3, i can't use bass booster around three months ago. I'm still hoping for a new version to fix this problem.",
        "I think it's a very good app, I even paid for the full version and in my thoughts it was very worth it I love it and I use it a lot. Although, I would like the que to select music on it's own instead of me having to make a que or playlist."

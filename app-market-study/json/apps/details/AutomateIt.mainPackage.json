        "Nice easy to use app, but you can't stack triggers. In other words you can choose a time of day, but you can't choose a time of day AND location.  That's a huge fault for me. I want an action to happen at a certain time only when I'm at a certain location. This surprises me. Because other similar. Apps allow for this stacking of triggers as well as actions.",
        "Can't trust it. Some triggers work, others do not. For example location triggers are unstable, work like 1 out of 10 times. The whole point of automation is that you can trust the task being automated!",
        "The app does what it says, it automates some actions. I'm having problems with half of the triggers since they do not work. Very useful for timing rules, but not for location rules or weather rules.",
        "So far this app is fantastic. I've tried Tasker, Trigger and IFTTT and they just sometimes didn't work... So far this one has been great... Great features. Love the wifi option features for vibrate at work or sound when home. Great app.",
        "Once I made sure the rules I set up had no redundancy or conflicting logic, which took a bit of planning and figuring out and experimentation with command types, this app worked and still works like a charm, including the location triggers. It helped that I used location triggers for my Bluetooth on/off and time triggers for Wi-Fi.  Big thumbs up. Was happy to pay a couple of bucks for the r,tra commands. Happy camper. Thank you so much! I hope you get a stipend from Samsung/the competition for making their products more tolerable and useful!",
        "Most of the useful actions I read about in the documentation are missing from my app install. I've reviewed the website and documentation as much as I can and cannot find any explanation for why my instance is missing these."

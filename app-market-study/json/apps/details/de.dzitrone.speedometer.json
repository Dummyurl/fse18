        "A bargain at the price of free Would be nice if the default screen on opening could be set. Otherwise, wonderful!",
        "Does not work",
        "It's works!",
        "Nice, but sorely needs an update. Uses the old pre-GPS Androidwear SDK.   Latest 5 supports native GPS, and means watches that have built in GPS (like the Sony smartwatch) will use this when there is no host mobile connected.  Please consider updating to latest SDK and using LocationManager API.",
        "Excellent little app. Could still be improved by the option to also show the time on the speedo screen.",
        "Good The speed has a error of minus 8km/hr"

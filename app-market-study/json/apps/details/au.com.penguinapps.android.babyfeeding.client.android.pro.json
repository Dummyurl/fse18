        "This app is perfect, no frills, no ads, just simply tracks activity. Clean intuitive layout. We've been using it for half a year now and can't imagine how we'd function without it.  UPDATE: I think this app may no longer be supported. No recent updates and the developer isn't responding to emails. Still good but the widgets have issues in Android a Nougat.",
        "I've been using this app since just first was born and loved it, recommend it to all my friends, no problem for nearly 3 years. Now using it with baby #2 who's just turned 2 months old and all of a sudden out of the blue yesterday, all her data just vanished!!! I tried syncing but it imported my 3 year old's data instead. Help!!! No support coming through from the facebook page???",
        "Perfect app for the first-time parent. It allows you to track everything for your child during those sleepless nights. I've used it for three-plus years for both my first and second child; I love it! Penguin Apps continue to make helpful updates from a usability standpoint. Fantastic customer service help, too. I highly recommend!",
        "Tracks everything!  Can't think of anything else I would track, and I've been using it for 2 years now.  Love how easy it is to track feeds (left/right/bottle and frequency) diapers (wet, soiled or both),  baths, pumping (left/right and quantity), sleep, growth, teeth, medicines and quantity and more.  Always records the time and has sticky notifications to remind you to feed baby or check diaper. Super helpful with baby brain and answering questions at the pediatricians office.",
        "Tried another app and hated it. This one is so user friendly and has everything I need to track. We used this for our daughter and now we're using it again for our newborn son. We really only use it for feeding and diapers, but I could see the other options being helpful too. Highly recommended, we find it incredibly helpful!",
        "I needed a way to track this stuff, because it always felt like I *just* fed / changed/ bathed the baby. Having this to look at made it easy to figure out what the baby needed.  Its really nice having feeds, changes, naps, baths, meds, growth, everything all together.   The Pro version is worth it to sync between devices (even between different caretakers). And to save everything for posterity.  I had trouble remembering my passphrase, and the developer was VERY helpful in helping me recover my info!"

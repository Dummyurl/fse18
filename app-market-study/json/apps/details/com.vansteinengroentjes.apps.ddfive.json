        "The application works beautifully, it was initially confusing to update the information database through the forums (which you don't need to have an account to do so). Got everything I need to check rules and stats of monsters in the free version. I can see that the developer is really committed to make this application one of the best available",
        "I tried registering with the forum, jumped through the hoops for it to tell me that it thinks I am a bot and will not let me register.",
        "I don't see an email or anything so leaving a review instead. This is probably a bug, or you pull data from another source (as I saw this on the wikia page for fighter as well), but battle Master and eldritch knight are missing from the fighter. I would also like to see hyperlinks to other sections. So, for example, I see a reference to another section of the phb and I can navigate there quickly. Ie, I see the word spells it takes me to the spells section. I am interested in the character manager, but would like to try before I buy. A short timed demo would be nice within the app. Otherwise, it looks pretty good!",
        "I like the app it pretty much has everything you would need. My only suggestion if you guys would make a filter for the random encounter. For example let us choose the the type of monsters the pc will encounter.",
        "Really helpful app, with lots of great downloadable content! One suggestion I'd like to see implemented is the ability to input fractional CR's for homebrew monsters, as it appears there is currently no way to assign a CR between 0 and 1.",
        "While it would be nice to not have to pay for everything, the free side is still quite nice and definitely helpful. Also updates regularly, which is good to know. 4.8 rounded up."

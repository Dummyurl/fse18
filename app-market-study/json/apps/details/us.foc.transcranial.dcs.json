These are the variables you can change. Please note some settings are mode dependent e.g. no frequency setting for direct current mode.Mode: tDCS, tACS, tPCS, tRNSCurrent: 0-2mATime: 1 to 40 minsFrequncy: 0 to 300HzOffset: 0 to 1.5mABipolar: Off, OnSham: Off, On, BlindSham period: 0 to 60 secondsVoltage: 0 to 60VYou can learn more about foc.us at www.foc.us*** Please ensure you update your v2 firmware to at least 1.8 via the computer application which can be found at http://www.foc.us/v2/downloads ******* If you are running Android 5.0* you will need to upgrade the firmware of your v2 to 1.9.

    "description": "This is a free 7 day trial version of the main MyAV app that can also control main other IP/IR controllable devices.MyAV is an unofficial Harman Kardon AV Receiver Wi-Fi & IR remote control app. Harman Kardon is a trademark of Harman International Industries, Incorporated. This app is in no way affiliated or endorsed by Harman International Industries.This app includes the ability to rename, remote and reorder inputs and a DLNA browser and a portrait mode.Unfortunately the Harman range of receiver’s provide no feedback (eg volume Level, input, mode etc), so communication is one way. Should Harman update this via a firmware update and provide the information on the protocol, then we can easily support this in MyAV.There’s also no way of turning on the receiver when it is in a cold power off state (this happens after an hour or so or after a power cut).Because of this MyAV can use IR blaster on certain Samsung & HTC Android devices to turn on the Harman AVR using the “All Power On” button in MyAV. If an IR blaster is present then the sound mode can also be changed (This isn’t possible on the official Harman app).Please note that we have been unable to find anyway to switch to the “Bluetooth” input via IR or IP.This app can be viewed portrait or landscape and is designed with high res graphics for tablets.Not only this but MyAV can also control a range of other products (whilst still controlling the volume of your Harman Kardon). Other devices include Blu-ray players (No Harman Kardon Blu-Ray players yet, but we will add them if people request it), TV's, set-top boxes, cable & sat.A full compatibility list can be found on our site:http://myav.co.uk/compatiblity.htmCompatible Harman Kardon Receivers/Amplifiers include:AVR 170, AVR 1700, AVR 270,, AVR 370, AVR151, AVR1510, AVR161, AVR1610, AVR171 (tested), AVR1710.If your receiver isn't listed or not detected by MyAV then please email us info@myav.co.uk",

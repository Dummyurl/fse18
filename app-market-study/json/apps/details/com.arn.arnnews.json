        "Fix needed Special news- audio has no playback control like seeking, pause and there is not supported to play in the background. It stops if I switch app, also if the phone is locked, funniest thing is that I can't resume the audio, I have to listen to the same thing again because no seeking option available..... Please Fix this.                 Few more suggestions... Please make audio files like news downloadable, please add Malayalam audio/voice news everyday (downloadable)",

        "This app is frustrating to use and does not have the same search functions or user interface as Sandicor Mobile did. I want Sandicor Mobile back and find this app infuriating so much that I avoid using it. It makes mobile MLS access remind me of early 1990's attempts at apps not the polished Sandicor Mobile it replaces.",
        "As an Agent, this app is AWESOME! The school features and info, the ease and use of finding and viewing homes in any area. I give it 4.8 stars.  If 2 minor things get fixed, it will be a 5 star!",
        "I have been using this application since it was first released.  My base of operation is in Phoenix, AZ. I have been very satisfied with the performance that this application provides.  In addition to Arizona I have used it in rural Tennessee, , Texas . Arkansas, and New Mexico.  It is easy to use and works well for both rentals and sales.  Better and more responsive that several other similar applications that I have access to.,",
        "This is a very exciting tool to use when looking for a new home. I can just point my camera, snap a pic and with Homesnap I've learned everything I need to know about that house and without even having to call an agent or go to any home locaters.",
        "I think it is very, very inaccurate.  My home has an appraisal of $680 000. 16351 Elizabeth Lake Rd,  Lake Hughes.  Please FIX It.",
        "This thing is awesome. It combines the feel of the major real estate search sites with the local MLS with a great user interface & ties me in."

        "So, finally found the culprit of that annoying weather popup! Really liked this app! But not this way, dear Dev.  Get rid of that thing and I'll come back! I may would even pay for your app ;)  but not with those kind of adds",
        "Has gotten to be very intrusive. Over the top pop adds that inhibits daily use. From a 5 star app to 0 star Just make add free one we will pay",
        "I get the need to make money but you do not do that by thrusting intrusive adverts onto my phones screen while I am using the device.  Time to find an alternative app I'm afraid...",
        "I will give you 1 star until you remove the weather pop up that keeps showing up at random. I agree with another review. \"This is a useful app, but not important enough to get random ads like this\". UNINSTALLED. I understand it costs to make but that way of doing it is just annoying.",
        "Really liked the draw on my watch, but has really intrusive ads on your phone which isn't worth it. That is exactly how you get your app uninstalled!",
        "Use this app all the time until you a ridiculous amount of pop up ads come on screen front about a week's ago loved this app until the now. Uninstalling do not even bother downloading this is now a spam app"

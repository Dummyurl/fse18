        "Used to work well At first it worked fine, but now it will suddenly think it's lost connection when my phone is in my hand and will do that at least 3 times in a row sometimes while I'm just sitting there with the phone or if I've come off of or connected to my WiFi. Uninstalling.",
        "Randomly thinks it's lost contact Ten to twelve times a day it decided that it's lost and then regained contact with my phone.  The constant buzzing is annoying.  Uninstalled.",
        "Loses Connection All The time This used to work really great but now this loses connection all the time.",
        "No control over vibration level etc Would be too easy to miss",

        "Was working perfectly... Before the recent Cyanogen 11s update, this theme worked brilliantly, but since the most recent OTA, an issue has arisen  within the stock messaging app. It has made it unable to read my own messages, as the text is now white on a white background. Also, the coloured boxes around both sets of messages have now disappeared. Not sure how easy this is to fix, but I though it was worth mentioning as it has become quite an issue. Thanks",
        "WiFi settings crashed - Fixed Everything looks fanstatic except the WiFi settings, it crashes every time when I try to go into it. Other themes work just fine except all these Ideal themes.. ( After all, it seems like a ROM issue, flashed a different ROM and now it works like charm, Awesome! )",
        "I like it when u guys are able to remove the shadow effect on the top on bottom screen.. Thumbs up for that.. But the dots on the lock configuration when u try to unlock the phone is ridiculously large.. Doesn't look nice at all..",
        "Awesome theme! The \"Ideal Themes family\" is arguably the best collection of themes you can ever find. Thanks for that. The only issue is that it's not compatible with Lollipop or newer.",
        "Almost perfect!! My messages don't show at all on the messaging app which really bums me out and also PLEASE game the recent apps list the regular kit Kat size :( it lags when I multitask but otherwise amazing!",
        "Awesome theme I love this theme much. But i found some color problem. Please fix message text color"

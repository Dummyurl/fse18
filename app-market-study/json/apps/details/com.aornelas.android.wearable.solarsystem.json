You can also cover the watch with your palm or press the side button.I plan to expand the content and features often, with the following coming soon:- Tap to reveal info card with quick facts such as: distance from Sun, gravity, and fun fact (e.g., \"the hottest planet in the solar system\").For updated information about what's being worked on see my Issues page: https://github.com/aornelas/SolarSystem/issuesThis app is open source!

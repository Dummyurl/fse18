    "description": "This weather app is not affiliated with NOAA or the National Weather Service.  Products provided by NOAA are in the public domain, and this app's use of those products is compliant with NOAA/NWS terms of use.This app provides forecasts, animated radar, hourly forecast, and current conditions, all in an intuitive and easy to use interface.  Just the information you need, provided accurately, quickly, and for your exact location.â˜… \"A no-nonsense approach to show weather data on your phone, but done well and great looking\" - Android CentralThis app uses NOAA point forecasts from your GPS location to get the most localized weather available.  Point forecasts are great for climbing, hiking, skiing, or any outdoor activity where weather from a nearby city isn't accurate enough.  GPS on the phone will provide the most accurate location, but usually isn't needed.  Nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi networks can also provide this information, and will be checked first to save time and battery.  You can also enter a location manually.To provided highly localized forecasting, this app uses point forecasts from the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), and is therefore only available in the US.If there is severe weather you will see a red warning icon in the corner of the current conditions icon.  You can press this icon for more details.  This app currently does NOT support severe weather alerts or notifications.  NOAA is providing this service directly through cell carriers.  You can read more about the service at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/wea.html.There are also several differently sized widgets available which can be placed on your homescreen to provide some basic weather information, without the need to open the app.Forecast discussion is available through the menu button.Permission: LocationThis app requires your location to provide you with the most accurate weather.  This is fundamental to how the app works.  You can still add manual locations as well if you prefer.Permission: Photos/Media/FilesThis permission is required by Google Maps so that it can cache map tiles for faster loading.  It sounds like the app is doing something with your photos or media, but it is not.  The permission means that the app has permission to access your files (which includes photos and media), but does not mean they are actually being accessed.  It is a subtle but important distinction.

        "Not the best. Radar hardly shows much except practically on top of current location. No way to see what's approaching from any distance. Very bad about giving error messages saying there must be an outage and \"try again later.\"",
        "Used to love this app, but now it no longer works at all. Constant update errors, never shows forecast and seldom shows current conditions. Was going to get the paid version, but instead will uninstall and find an app that works.",
        "Hands down the devs of this app have done the best out of them all in compiling NOAA data in a very easy to interpret platform. If you are in need of monitoring more then a couple cities, their \"pro\" version is well worth the money.",
        "One star cause it currently isn't working, while my other noaa weather app is. What's up with that???  Okay update  as of 02/27/18, currently working so I'll change my rating to 4 stars, plus it is my favorite weather app. Keep up the great work.",
        "Gives me a quick glance at trends and forecasts. The  graphs provide graphic clues to current and forecasted conditions",
        "Too restrictive. You can only save three locations, then you have to buy the upgrade."

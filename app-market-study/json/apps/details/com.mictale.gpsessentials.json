        "Used to work fine on my last phone but on my current one none of the tracking features work, it will display exactly where I've been but no other information (distance, time etc) it says I've done 0ft while the map shows I've travelled thousands of feet. absolutely no use in it's current state.",
        "Not working in my phone (Oneplus 5) properly. Satelite in used in fix jumps to 0 abruptly. I fist thought it was gps issue. Then download gps test app and it worked fine. Contacted omeplus customer care and no problem was detected with my set.",
        "This app was my go to app for navigating between fishing points at sea. As my list of waypoints increased it was becoming increasingly tedious to select a way point from a list, until I realised there was a brilliant option to select way points via google maps. Unfortunately, using this option the app was randomly switching waypoints during navigation which was very annoying. Still a good app but unfortunately no longer for me.",
        "I want to measure the distance I traveled in motorcycle. I keep the mobile in my pocket with the app running. But when I check after some time the mobile screen is off and the app stopped tracking speed and distance. I love this app and using since long time but this time I am frustrated because of this app. I suggest you to improve this app for running in background so that when mobile is locked, the app should still run and track speed in the background.",
        "This was my favorite application a few years back. Now the dashboard is obstructing my screen and I don't find it that user friendly.",
        "Used to be my go to app. Now I find it unusable Simply unreliable won't track walks keeps losing track of me and stopping."

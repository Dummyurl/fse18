        "Awesome application and an absolute must have if you have an android wear watch with a speaker. The text to speech is amazing, you can hear who the message/email is from by hearing the name of the application along with a notification sound, who it is from and it reads the whole thing out loud so you don't have even take your phone out of your pocket/bag. It has so many more features than I have mentioned, this the best android wear applications available on the Play Store in my opinion...... excellent!!!",
        "Hey Dear developer. I currently have a Sony smartwatch 3. The app just say updating your watch forever and ever. It used to work fine but after an update it just stop working. Can we have a fix please:)",
        "I have a Huawei watch 2. I installed this app because I wanted BOTH sound and vibration for text messages. The app did initally helped with vibration but I could not get it to provide audible notification for messages. I sent 2 emails to app support informing them of the problem and requesting assistance to remedy it. They never returned my calls.   I uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it. This time I got the audible and vibrations to work for messages received and reminders that I set. I have given the app 4 stars because of support's failure to respond to my two emails. It took a lot of work to get this to work for me to provide both Audible and vibratory notification for selected apps.  I have contributed $ to support this app.  ADDENDUM: I got the app to work by uninstalling and reinstalling it on BOTH my phone and watch. Works perfectly now no thanks to watch support. They never did respond to my emails.",
        "I like how the notifications are customizable. The LG Watch Style has very weak vibrations, so I kept missing notifications. However, now I get a whole bunch of phantom vibrations. Buzz, buzz, with nothing. Went on all last night, so I am uninstalling.",
        "After searching high and low I am finally able to have custom ringtones and notifications on my watch. Yippie and yahoo. Oh yeah. Another F.U. to Google for making it so difficult to get custom sounds on watches. Now for movies on the watch😷",
        "No longer works as of Wear 2.0 despite installing app on watch and setting apps to vibrate. An essential app is now utterly useless, which is a huge shame."

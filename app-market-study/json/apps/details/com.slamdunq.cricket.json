        "This app is great! I don't know why people are saying it is bad, I use my Samsung gear fit 2 to calculate on the bowls, and it works fine",
        "Doesn't recors It doesn't record my bowels at all. I've tried numerous times and it has not recorded one. I've had my phone on me so that it is in Bluetooth range but still nothing. Not happy",
        "It's poor. I can't even login. It's asking for the email even when i have given it. I can't even login via Facebook or Google.  I am using a Samsung gear fit2. Please help me with a solution. I want to try this...!",
        "Not working at all. If it even can't make me login then how come it will be useful to do analysis of my bowling."

        "Was a 5.  Ugh. UX was better before. I used different charts for different accounts as it made sense. As a paying customer this was important.  A possible fix could be the option to apply certain charts we select to only certain accounts... Or having the option to use the old UI.  Also... If I do select an account at the top to do a reconcile (switching transactions from cleared to reconciled) it works but then deselects the account and I have to go up to the top and select it again to do the next transaction.  I guess I can try going to \"Records\" and screwing with the filters a bit.",
        "The new ui scheme is better but it has strange decisions: why is the 'add a person to your group sharing' button so easily accessible on top? A user needs that button maybe once or twice in a lifetime. Other such decisions make me think this app needs a ux overhaul, especially since it has too many features, a classic case of can't see the forest for the trees...",
        "pretty much a great app. but sometimes it crashes ever so gratefully and duplicates the transfer records messing the balance. also a real (not crypto) currency rate widget would be nice!  also please make a setting to change the default account input from notification",
        "this is a very good app. it just the latest update is very bad. i think the swiping method made this app very convenient, but now it is gone.  besides, the values shown in color grid is incorrect. i thought i lost all my data, luckily after checked with the balance widget, i still have it. it just the color grid is not right.   please rectify this problems.",
        "Latest Update is awful. I have seen someone has already commented to say this and there has been a response.  Frankly that response is not good enough as the app is now not suitable for propose and has drastically reduced functionality. Unless this latest update is removed I would avoid installing. It's not what it was.",
        "Hate the new update... Common widgets for all account is awful... I customized the widgets according to the account but now I cannot do so. Please remove the common view and rollback to different dashboard for different accounts."

When I bought my new phone, I was told that all apps would reload to my phone as they we currently installed. Now I'm being told again that I need to upgrade my app to premium to enjoy unlimited access to recipes. I had hundreds of recipes saved, which i cannot currently access. I am very disappointed in this and wish to ask consideration of you to rectify this inconvenience. Thank you"

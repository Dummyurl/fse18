        "Very good Gets you access you all your wear apps quickly. I have not paid for the double tap feature as I am trying out all the launchers at present, but if the double tap feature is reliable then this is a solid, simple launcher - no shortcut settings no bloated features, just quicker access to your apps in a scrollable window. The persistent notification isn't really ideal, so you have to pay if you want to use this app properly, but it seems very reasonable to do so from my short evaluation.",
        "Like it Great app, only wish it had the ability to hide apps that I don't want to see and set apps as favorites so they will be at the top!!!",

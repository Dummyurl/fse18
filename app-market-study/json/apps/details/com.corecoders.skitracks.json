        "Ski tracks only tracks the first run of the day. After starting the app pauses tracking after the first run. I've lost several long days of skiing to this bug. When this happens a notification appears in the notification bar that cannot be dismissed and the phone must be rebooted to remove it.",
        "Best snow app to track where you been and to record speed and distance covered when working. With my 1plus1 5 stops recording after 1 run or an hour? What's going on?",
        "Have always had this app on either android or iOS and I use it every year without problems. Its THE BEST ski tracking app. Packed with accurate information about your day and easily sharable by social media. Just wish they had an app for samsung watches, when that happens I will give it 5 stars as it will be perfect!",
        "It used to be great, best app for skiing.  However something went wrong with some of the last updates, and tracking  does not work (on the same phone as last 2 years- Samsung Galaxy6) it only shows  lifting up and does not capture skiing down metrics. Only first slope max speed is recorded, but it is incorrect. Also distance is incorrect. Also noticed that backups from previous years have wrong calendar  dates.   Will reinstall and give a try tomorrow, maybe something went wrong with setup.  === Works fine after reinstall. 5 stars are back. Note for Samsung phone users: disable power saving, else GPS does not work.",
        "When it works it is great, but even with the latest update, it stops recording on my OnePlus 5 after 30-90min after start. When you fix it I will give it 5 stars, as it is a great app.",
        "Stops working after run 1. Was good. Now useless."

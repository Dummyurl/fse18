        "PLEASE FIX!  I love the app, been using it since I was 15. However there's a problem with saving stories. I've been trying to write a new story and it's simply not saving. If i log out it deletes the story completely. I thought it might be my phone but I've tried it on my tablet and on the website as well but nothing is working. Please fix it.",
        "Wattpad is trash. Especially when you try to save a chapter but then it messes up the whole book interface. I couldn't even get into my other books, it just appears blank",
        "This app used to be very good, now...not so much. Constantly login off, and it takes forever to log on again. Sooo many updates, but it doesn't get any better. That's why you shouldn't try to fix what wasn't broken in the first place.",
        "The app is okay but with the new update is UNBEARABLY slow. Im waiting up to ten minutes at worst for my stories to load, even with an extremely strong internet connection. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed.",
        "I can give you a 5 stars but when im editing my stories sometimes it wont publish i tried again later and it still says an error occured and it always so slow to load up my stories sometimes when i press the edit button it works but it only shows at the top edit story thats it i cant see my story there i only see at the top edit story pls fix this and also why cant i connect to wattpad",
        "I really regret that i update this because it's SO SLOW im waiting for the story to load for about 5 minutes, please fix this as soon as possible, then i'll rate it 5 stars tnx."

        "Excellent detailed maps of France and French territories I've used these maps on a few trips to France, and found them excellent.  The 1 25000 maps have allowed me to use some very minor roads and chemins.  All works reliably.",
        "Black screen freeze Problems after latest update, app opens with black screen and freezes phone, same with 2 phones and tablet. Was a great app, now unusable, rolled back to previous version until fixed.",
        "Best hiking, biking app for France I have been using this for some weeks.  You download the IGN hiking maps you need for the region you are hiking, cycling etc. Then you can use them off line. Choose your region then select the hike you want from the many uploaded. Start your hike and your progress is tracked. Go off course and you are warned.  Tech support is prompt and helpful in French and English.",
        "Sity trail Good app, it works",
        "Une belle (R)évolution dans la domaine des cartes \"embarquées\". L'appli fonctionne très bien & j'ai hâte de gagner une montre connectée Android Wear...Lol...Pour moi, c'est l'avenir, je me suis toujours servi d'un GPS de poignet depuis 05/2008 et c'est bien plus pratique que de sortir un le GSM surtout lorsque l'on marche avec des bâtons dans un relief accidenté.J'ai actuellement une Samsung Gear couplée avec une autre appli (pas aussi efficace), attention à la durée de la batterie... Je reçois les notifications SityTrail sur la montre (erreurs de parcours)...  Ce qu'il y a de bien surtout, c'est la possibilité de tracer  ses parcours sur le site web... Un petit truc à prévoir ? La possibilité de créer des dossiers pour ranger ses randos sur le site web",
        "OK Have only used it for walking so far and it is pretty good. It is the only software I have found that uses proper IGN maps and at an affordable price."

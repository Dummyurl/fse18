    "description": "The original lighter app for Android Wear!This is an animated lighter flame that rotates to keep the flame upright on your wrist.Use it at your favorite concert!  It might look very dangerous, but this is actually just a very complex computer simulation of a flame.Our Scientist devoted several minutes during the development of this technology to ensure no actual flames would come out of your wear device.  It is not a real flame (really!), so it will not burn you or your clothing.However, it does a very poor job at lighting real cigarettes.  We might work on that for the next version, or not.Just swipe it away to turn it off, or it will timeout automatically, as all wear apps do.It should work on all Android Wear devices.  Built and tested on a Moto 360.",

        "Only slightly more useful than the old \"Electric Fan\" app (The world's most useless app on Palm Pilots. Just showed my age didn't I?) Great show-off app for a smart watch. It's actually handy as a flashlight app, and probably about as bright as a real lighter/candle. Only two or three things would polish off this app to perfection:  A) Being able to \"flick the Bic\" by swiping the screen to \"light\" it. B) Being able to \"blow it out\" via the microphone. Note that the Android iLighter app does all this) An option C) would add unreliability. (The lighter doesn't always light the first time it's flicked)",
        "Great for concerts! This is the ideal concert/karaoke Android Wear app for geeks that don't smoke, but still want to blend in with the crowd.",
        "Near app Useless, but neat.",
        "Like magic! Pretty cool app to show off.",
        "Nice Trick ,love it"

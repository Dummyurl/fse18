        "Excellent interface, but math is off The interface is very intuitive, but on some occasions one can not see the placed bet. Unfortunately the calculations have some bugs. For instance one loses the placed bet, when the app is exited. Or even if you win a little, you end up with less money than you started with. But still it's a lot of fun and astoundingly good for a watch game.",
        "Very cool Fun to play, a nice way to the pass time as you can start or stop when ever you want. My only complaint is I cannot split. Perhaps the watch face is not big enough for the gesture to work? Please change the gesture! Double down works fine, cannot double down.",
        "Winner winner, chicken dinner! As simple as it is, a lot of thought has gone into this game, to adapt it to the unique interface and input of a \"smart\" watch as precisely as possible... And the developer has done a spectacular job (though I do wonder why one's bet only shows some of the time - this is a confusing design flaw!). Blackjack Wear looks fantastic, it's easy to use, works flawlessly and most importantly, it's plenty of fun! Very highly recommended, for all users of Android Wear \"smart\" watches.",
        "Moto 360 OK so with the newest update the app runs on the 360. It takes a while to get used to the swipes. They are short-distance swipes, not from the edge of the screen. But anyways, fun way to kill a few minutes here and there.",
        "Hole card showing glitch graphics Running on a Huawei watch, the hole card's right side is shown partially revealing the hole card before the player stays. Also the split and double gestures are prone to mistakes please just include buttons when opportunity is present. Stay and hit function well",
        "game is good. Minor flaws like always resets bet to 5 no matter if change settings or previous bet. Sometimes can't even see how much you bet at all. Also Aces should be either 1 or 11 but game often counts as 0."

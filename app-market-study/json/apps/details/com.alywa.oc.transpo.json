        "The app works offline which is best for me. It lets you see all the buss stops around you and gives you the bus stop's number so you can text it for the information. If you have data, it aparently gets even better by giving you all that info right away~ overall, a good app that does what we need it to do~ Only petpeeve is the placement of the add when looking at the stop schedules as it hides the last one of the day.... which is kinda important when you think you missed the last but you didnt? And actually miss it because of it? ****needs to be fixed please and thank you :)",
        "Update: it seems the issues have been fixed. The app is very snappy and responsive, and looks good to boot. Also, great job on the dev for replying quickly to feedback!  Original review: I like the look of the new update, but it is not working very well with me. Pretty much anything I try to do, I get an error saying \"Oops, Unable to query data source\". I tried using both Wifi and Data and nothing seems to work. I even tried reinstalling the app and still nothing.   It used to be great before this update, and I hope the problem can be solved.",
        "Used to work. Randomly stopped being able to get any route information. Doesn't appear any way to find out why it's not working so I have to assume the app is at fault. When it did work, it would have problems every other week.",
        "This was the best of the octranspo-tracking apps out there until the recent update. It's rare now that the app is able to query the GPS database. Seriously frustrating! Wait until this issue is fixed before you bother with this app.  The company keeps saying it is an Octranspo issue, but bottom line, this app, unlike others that can still query the database, isn't working.",
        "For some reason your widgets don't work on weekends. Works fine during the week, but as soon as weekends come your widgets become empty. And also this app needs to get android wear support with an app directly on android wear watch which is missing.",
        "Love that I can see scheduled times while offline. The only issue is that some of the routes aren't showing up at stops I know they stop at, so I can't see gps data. (Example the 294, I can see the schedule in the app, but you can't find it at Greenboro or South Keys stops)."

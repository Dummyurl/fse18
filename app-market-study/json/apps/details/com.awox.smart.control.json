        "The control fell one time on the ground and can't connect to the bulb anymore but it still blinks when I press any button. So I tried the app and even tho the bulb appears on my bluethood scan, in the app it always says it can't detect any device.",
        "Was working fine for a month. Now it tries to update my light's firmware but the app is unable to connect to it. Tried to remove the device and even reinstall the application but no luck. Please help!",
        "After the first connect, doesnt worked. Since 3 weeks no answer from support. Very dissappointed...",
        "Worked for an hour or so. Now the app doesn't pick up the bulbs anymore. They work fine with the app for the iPhone though. Fix it!",
        "Sad moment! Nice idea but application doesn't work! Thanks at least I have the remote control, I cannot connect the remote control with the app never worked! How it is possible? When reviewed the comments can see is a general problem! @Eglo any solution?  Who I asked me to contact them, I did it but not responding, updated the new version and simply doesn't work, tried with 3 different phones. Don't buy it if you don't have a controller, the application doesn't work.",
        "Hey there! I had the same issues as most of the users here, while trying to establish a connection with my Fueva 1 lamp for the first time. The app always got stuck at the last step of the connection wizard, with the litlle green circle spinning until the end of times. However, in one of the many attempts after restarting the app, I tried to leave everything as default in the wizard setup and it worked like a charm. With that, I mean that I didn't change either the picture nor the name of the lamp, just hit \"next\" until it was over and it worked fine. I had another lamp installed in another room, so I tried this method again and it also worked, first try. So there you go, looks like an annoying bug but at least seems to have an easy solution. Later I could change the names and picture of both lamps without any problem or issues with the connection. Hope this helped someone!"

    "description": "Did you ever felt, that one Charger/USB cable set charges your device really fast and the other not? Now, you can prove this with Ampere.Measure the charging and discharging current of your battery. PRO features:- Widgets- Notification- Alerts on device - Alerts on Android WearThe app works on Android 4.0.3+ devices. Not every device is supported because there are devices which lacks an appropriate measurement chip (or the interface) and they can not be supported at all. Please read the list of not supported phones at the end of the description.The app is not meant to be mA accurate. It is only good for evaluate which Charger/USB cable combo is working the best for you on the same device.----Please read also the FAQ: http://goo.gl/R8XgXX ----Start the app and wait ca. 10 seconds (\"measuring\" is on the display). After this time, the charging or discharging current will be shown.The current depends on many things:- Charger (USB/AC/Wireless)- USB cable- Phone type- Current tasks running- Display brightness- WiFi state- GPS statePlease don't use the readings on this app as concrete science. However, the readings are good enough to relatively measure how various chargers and USB cables fair on the same device.If the app shows 0mA all the time, please use the settings option \"Old measurement method\". You can force the app with it to use the old measurement interface, if the Lollipop device has at least one.Unfortunately some Samsung devices don't give correct (measured) values (e.g.: S5), just the maximum possible charging current with the actual USB cable/charger configuration. This is a firmware problem.----Background info: The app measures the charging/discharging current of the battery. If your phone is not connected to a charger, you see the discharging current which is negative. If you connect a charger then the current what the charger gives will be used to supply your phone and the remaining power will be charged into the battery.If your phone consumes 300 mA without a charger connected (-300mA on the display), then a 500 mA charger will charge your battery maximum with 200 mA current (200mA on display).----Technical info: The displayed current is an average value from 50 measurements minus the 10 upper values and the 10 lower values. The displayed current can be shaky or unstable or even zero which means, that the Android system provides unstable values. Every company uses different battery types and other hardware making it difficult to get accurate results about your charger.----LiPo batteries don't draw the maximum for the full time it takes to charge the phone. If your battery is charged almost full then the charging current will be much less as by lower battery levels.- A graph explaining LiPo charge stages: http://batteryuniversity.com/_img/content/ion1.jpg- Dave's (EEVBlog) LiPo Charging Tutorial: http://youtu.be/A6mKd5_-abk----Phones/ROMS compatible only with \"Old measurement method\" switched on and selected the right \"Measurement interface\":➤ HTC One M7 / M8➤ LG G3Phones/ROMS reported to be not working with this app:➤ Galaxy Grand Prime - fortuna3gdtv➤ Galaxy Note2 - t03g, t03gchn, t03gchnduos, t03gcmcc, t03gctc, t03gcuduos➤ Galaxy S3 - d2att, d2spr, d2vmu➤ Galaxy Tab4 7.0 - degas3g➤ HTC Desire 510 - htc_a11ul8x26➤ HTC One S (ville), X (endeavoru), XL (evita)➤ HTC Sensation 4G - pyramidPlease do not give wrong rating, if your phone is one of the above.

        "Does exactly what it says it will and does it with a simple, logical and uncluttered interface. Just used the app to diagnose a charging problem with my galaxy tab. When using, the device would discharge faster than the charger could recharge. Turns out it was the cheap usb charging cable that i bought of amazon. Swapped to a different cable and the charge current tripled. I would never have found that without this app.",
        "Fantastic!  Does what it says and it has an amazing level of options! In addition to all the charging methods it was previously able to detect, it now also detects Motorola Turbo charging. The only thing I could possibly want that this app does not have is to be able to determine charge rates of Moto Mods but that may be we'll be inside.  *I would like it to detect when it's charging up in Moto mod in the \"Charge Rate\" section but I realize that's a lot too ask as the target audience would be comparatively small.  Thank you for a great app. Job well done. Very well done.",
        "I've just always had it on my phones, since... I think around the time the app went up. It services one specific technical need and it does it well. If you need to know the details of what's going on with the interplay of your battery, chargers, and phone, then this is the tool to use. There's always room to improve, logs for better diagnostics would help, but I love it as is.",
        "Very useful to determine battery health and troubleshooting, if you know what you're looking for and know how to interpret the readings. For example, as your battery ages, current will increase, being relatively higher for a moderate load, as compared to a new battery. This is actually a function of the voltage drop resulting from increasing internal resistance of the battery.",
        "Shows me mAmp/hour charge rate and other useful stats. Easy to read and allowed me to ID charging rate issue as poor electrical contact in USB socket on tablet (not wires or battery as many forum inhabitants suggested). There's no substitute for good data in analysis. Garbage in=Garbage out. Now sorted this issue. Thanks Guys",
        "Used to be good. I've paid for no ads since 29.09.2017, but suddenly now my widget locked again, and I must pay again for no ads. Why??    I only have a single account in my device, the account I used to purchase before. I tried to reinstall but still not work.   Now it all set..!"

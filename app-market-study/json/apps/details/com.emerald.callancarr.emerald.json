        "Moto 360 2nd gen touch issue On the moto 360 2nd (46 inch) gen the corners are just barely selectable. But not reliable. Feels like trying to select a single pixel. Often I tap multiple times and accidentally move the wrong piece. It is frustrating. Would rate this higher if this issue is resolved.                 UPDATE: thanks for responding so quickly! unfortunately the app now keeps crashing when I try to launch it... UPDATE: works now!",
        "Bought and played or tried to play on my LG G Watch. It doesn't have no different color boards or pieces. Looks all bland and washed out over time! It also stays stuck on my watch with no option to exit (gotta let the watch screen shut off. Where's the difficulty level?",
        "Works again Update to watch caused crash, support got on it fix quickly and the chess games works great again.",
        "Sony Smartwatch 3 - doesn't start at all... totally unable to play.... please fix! I've heard good things. Will up rating when it works.",
        "Beautiful This is a great app, Ive never lost to the cpu but quite fun. Surprisingly easy to use, only messes up every once and awhile. Id like to see an undo button",
        "Great app I didn't think it would be playable, fat fingers small watch. I got an ink pen with a stylist. Very fun. It's perfect!"

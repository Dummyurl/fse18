        "Love it, specifically the overall minimalism, the reminder feature, that it syncs with Android Wear, and can be added to the notification tiles.  Only feature that seems missing is ability to include a long break option (for lunch).  You have to pay for the ability to adjust the work/break duration settings, but it is worth it and helps support a developer who has long contributed to the Android development community. One issue, which I'll email developer about, is with the update I get reminders on my watch every minute, unless I deactivate the sync.",
        "I got a promo code for this app earlier. It became free for all and now the custom timer is a paid feature. Isn't there any way to unlock the feature for those who have it in the purchase history of their Google account?",
        "For some reason, the app won't keep running on my phone. I'm not sure why, and at this point I've stopped trying.   The developer reached out to me to see if it would work for me on the latest update. It still doesn't, but seeing an attempt by the developer to please a dissatisfied customer is always nice, so I'm improving my review, even if I still can't get the app to work.",
        "Brilliant app for productivity, responsive and friendly developer.  I would love this to have IFTTT support in future (so that when I start a cycle it automatically plays my work playlist on spotify)",
        "Simple and applies the necessary pressure. Does it's job. The developer is the best guy ever.",
        "Adding custom cycle time would be great :3"

        "5217 4.0 is here! Pretty big release I might say. You can finally use your own custom timers instead of the default 52-17. Mind you, \"5217\" is still the brand of the app so this new feature is unlockable via in-app purchase just for those who really want it. If you've donated before this will be automagically unlocked. Also a new feature to set your own break period message instead of displaying the presets. Android Wear 2.0 support is also here ðŸ™Œ",

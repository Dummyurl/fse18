        "Good but as everything could improve It would be very useful to have a chart for the current measurements taken while charging or discharging (using) the battery. Specially with the current fast chargers and li-ion lifetime battery concerns, this current chart could be useful for us to evaluate the chargers we are using with our cellphones",
        "It just tells u about what percentage it has but we already know the percentage it does not have battery saving mode, plus it has a dozens of ADD it is dead annoying.",
        "Why does my Samsung Galaxy S6 say 1 hour 15 min til charged & this app is saying 3 hours 11 min but both are on the same charger ? Could it it be this is a dodgy app ?",
        "I could not find any difference between the earlier app \"Battery\" and this except that this works also with the watch.Old one is actually more beautiful .",
        "useful app but still need some work it's working good but from time to time it's spot reading data and just freeze",
        "crap! doesn't show correct discharge time!"

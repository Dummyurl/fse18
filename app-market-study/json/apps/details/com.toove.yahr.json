        "So much better than the stock",
        "Best Harmony remote Unlike the original Harmony app from Logitech, this app is clean, fast and does exactly what it should do. I was expecting ads as the app is free, but no ads! Can't wait for Android Wear support, keep up the good work!",
        "Great start It will need some improvements, eg. some buttons missing, devices screen etc. Overall it is very promising. Can't wait for Tasker integration!"

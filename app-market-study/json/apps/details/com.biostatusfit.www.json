I like the training part of this app, I like the fitness tests.  I do not like that I can't get it to connect to my gear fit.   I do not like that this app seems to be the one that is causing my phone to randomly turn off and restart.   I don't like that Google fit doesn't track my steps the same as my gear fit. Thus not giving me the proper credit.   I will keep this app for now.  But needs work.",

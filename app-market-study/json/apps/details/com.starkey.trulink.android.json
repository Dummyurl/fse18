        "It's  too complicated for those of us not born in the electronic age. You need to be able to control background noise without having to set it up for every situation. It takes too long naming the setting etc.",
        "I could not follow the instructions",
        "As an app it functions well.  There are limitations for Android users on the hearing aids themselves that should be pointed out by the providers when we purchase Starkey hearing aids.  Apple has the market on streaming audio and media on these HAs because they have put the development in and made it proprietary. ðŸ˜• As a faithful android user with hearing loss, it really sucks. But the app works and functions properly.  So there is that.",
        "I have a halo and streaming doesn't work. I used to have an iPhone but tree system was not right for me. Ive always had android/ Samsung devices I shouldn't be forced to by a $800 phone just to stream to my hearing aids. Please make this available. Thank you.",
        "Very happy with them but sometimes it sounds likes breaking glass or waterfallingwhen in a situation with alot of background noise ;it would also be nice the comfort boost would stay activated when switching setting (geo locations) and if androids could answer your phone and stream to hearing aids it would be perfect",
        "Streaming and listening to phone calls a MUST. Don't understand why, since bkuetooth5 has a low power option why that can't be  used. It has been 5 months since a new version. When the S9 comes out will it be supported?"

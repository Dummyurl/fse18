    "description": "Looking for the most expensive wearable app on Google Play ?! Just bought an expensive wearable and looking for a fancy and expensive app to install ?! Here is the app for you....This is a proof-of-concept app, which has been assigned the highest price possible for an app on the Play Store.Please note: This app is just for demonstration purposes, and doesn't actually do anything. So don't be disappointed if you install it and nothing happens.... Having said that, if you're a millionaire with plenty of cash to spare, you might want to download this just for laughs. Certainly it would give me (the developer) some laughs ;)Talking some statistics : only 1 in every 10000 people viewing this listing buy this app and that one person will uninstall the app and will get a refund within 2 hours....",

        "Very cool and useful app  Can't say much yet about the prediction but everything else works really nice. Only suggestion is to add some greyed-out vertical lines in the graphs to improve readability.",
        "I use the fitness and heart-rate prediction. Both provide very good and informative feedback.",
        "Very useful, especially battery visualization made me very happy One of the best app I have installed on my smartwatch.",

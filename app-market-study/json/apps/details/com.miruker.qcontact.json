        "The number of contacts shown in each group is incorrect.",

        "Quite a gem! Small, quick, and most importantly provides group functionality with my Outlook groups for managing and emailing the group. UI is simplistic but clean and functional. There are \"surprises\" in that it is not clear what you get for upgrading, unless you try a setting or try to use a widget and then get prompted for the upgrade. I'd give it 5 if there was better information on this, and may purchase the upgrade anyway just to say 'Thank you!\" for making a simple app that handles contact groups on Android Marshmallow.",
        "Very useful.",
        "Doesn't work Very hard to use. Missing phone numbers. Incorrect group info. Better design over all others.",
        "Search option App is good but it would be good if a search option is added to make calls with names rather than scrolling with alphabet order."

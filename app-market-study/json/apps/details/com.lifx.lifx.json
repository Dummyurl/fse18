        "Just got 1 bulb to try. Well love it! Easy setup. Easy integration with Alexa. Super rich in features. Still exploring them. I would definitely recommend these. But as I may want more controlled lights, I have to decide if I want to switch to hub based solution. Certainly the color realism blows the others away. Ok price for the bulb, but 39 instead of 53 woul be better, but what the heck",
        "I have this app rated 5, however I deleted my rating to put a one because of the horrible new adaptation of the app. It is difficult to use the lights look a lot worse because of the switching between lights the modes are horrible and not customizable at all. If you're going to add new things at least give us the ability to change back to the way we liked it.",
        "Hardly ever works. I have to restart app several times before the bulb gets detected. Very frustrating. My WiFi settings and signal are all good and I tried it on 2 different devices. Seems to be getting worse and worse. Full of annoying ads. UPDATE: completely useless. Worse than ever. I would give it -5 stars id I could. Don't bother",
        "App has come a long way. If you have a dual band router and you're having connectivity issues, hide the SSID of the band the bulb is not using. DEVELOPERS: please work with Automateit devs to fix plugin and keep it from crashing.",
        "Recent updates have done nothing but ruin the integrity of this app. It constantly disconnects my light randomly and can never \"re-find\" it. When it works it does its job pretty well but its just to unreliable to get a better rating. Going with the more expensive but trustworthy company like Phillips Hue is a far better idea for anyone wanting this technology.",
        "Frequent poor connection and lag on the software side. Not a fan of how the update split the white and color wheels - far less simple.  A shame that the bulbs are a definite 5/5 and I struggle to give the app a 2/5 rating."

        "Has all the basic information you would expect from an app like this. Coverage of games outside the UK is very limited, often not providing basic information easily available elsewhere on the internet. I've also found using the app to be rather harsh on my mobile data usage and battery life.",
        "Not as intuitive as some other apps, player stats are random. Hard to work out sometimes. The Goal app is awesome for stats, if Fot managed to be as thorough, would be the best. Also I'm struggling with alerts. Otherwise, looks nice and fun to use.",
        "Thanks for adding TV schedules for India. Was waiting for it. Loving your app. Best football app to ever exist on play store.  One thing i noticed - dailymotion videos never work for me,never. Please look into it.Thx devs.",
        "Has all the info a man needs! It's up to date and has all the news and etc. It's great! Sadly I think they don't show teams from my country but nobody wants to see them anyway",
        "Very bad notifications. It delays about two minutes. You have useful application but You don't upgrade it. You should work on the notification. It delays. You work on it or I stop using it.",
        "I like this app since,  but i find one problem,,- notiffication is delay check this problem.           *Download this app is the best my friend!✔"

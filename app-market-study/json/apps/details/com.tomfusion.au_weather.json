        "I've been using this app for many years and it's been great but recently after an update it signed me up to a $10/month SMS service WITHOUT ASKING ME. I sent STOP but it has already charged my phone account the $10. Instant uninstall.. not impressed.",
        "Updates stopped. Widget doesn't open when tapped. Tried to reinstall, and now when I select a widget, no widget appears in place on screen. 23/03/2017 Reinstalled it, on my HTC after an update, and everything was working well, for the last 8 months. Yesterday the App stopped updating. NO information at all. No temp, current or forecast info. Tried to refresh, and informed unable to update as no auto-location available. Strange since I had set it to use a specific city, Adelaide. Went in and selected Adelaide again, did a refresh and it went back to using auto-location. What The ... ! Funny thing is, I have this app on my Samsung tablet, and it's working fine. This is annoying, as this app is one of the few with a 4x1 widget that is easy to read and well laid out. Tried reinstall, to no avail. I select the 4x1 widget, and despite it asking for set up data, nothing appears on my home screen.",
        "I only used this app for the status bar temperature. As it used BOM weather, it's the most accurate weather app with that functionality. However, you can't use it outside of Oz, and you can't display temp in status bar without having a widget somewhere on your screen. It has also stopped updating the past few months (my wife and I have both experienced that problem on different devices). Uninstalling.",
        "I'd pay for a premium app if it included a clock. The HTC digital clock has weather but its not BOM sourced and inaccurate.  Only thing missing.",
        "Radar doesn't work Comprehensive info, but can't get radar to open for any location. That's a major pain.",
        "Playing up Was a very good app had it for over a year however widget on main screen won't update anymore and you can't access app if you click on it"

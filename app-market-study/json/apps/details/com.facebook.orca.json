        "You really need to calm down with the updates. Even if I'm a beta tester, 50 megabytes of update data daily is a lot. I know you want to improve your app but right now the best way for you to do that is to reduce data usage. Otherwise your consumers will go to other platforms that uses less data.",
        "It is great to keep in contact with friends and family",
        "I like Messenger but there is only 2 problems: during video calling, I can't make my camera bigger whenever I like, it's way too small to see! It's not like Whatsapp video calling where you can make your camera bigger to see your own face big if you want. Also, please add better & realistic filters with better color quality like on instagram. ðŸ˜† Please fix this feature & make it like Whatsapp! Thanks!",
        "I highly appreciate it because of i can send free messages esp in times of emergency! Keep it up! My concern is that there are times that it deletes the messages by itself! Please my messages are very important to me. And how can i back up the messages? Thanks and God bless! :)  Pls. Some of my messages from my contacts have been deleted by its own. I already changed my password and put some app locks still the messages are being deleted by its own.",
        "Good application, but the latest updates have taken the option to sign out away. The application constantly wants to take over the default SMS . Not sure how workable all the options are on a Australia network. As most applications are created and tested in other countries. Sadly we find that the local network can not accommodate these new options or updates due to network types.",
        "I run FB on my chrome browser and I was forced to download this app just so i could see the messages people had sent me. I do not use the facebook app because I do not agree with Mark zuckerberg and his downright authoritarian censorship. I was banned for 30 says for stating a opinion, a mild one at that, and there is absolutely no way to appeal. I do not recommend this app at all. Find alternatives if you can, such as discord or Skype."

        "STILL NO FIX for the messaging bug, when I have this app installed notifications pop for half a second then disappear. So then I have no idea that I've received messages. This has been an issue for several updates, and this review gets buried as old. This is still an issue, I have to delete this app every time I plan to go without my watch. Making me use my watch less than I'd like.",
        "98% happy with this app, except for the \"always on\" media notifications on the watch.    When I'm playing music on my phone (which is most of the time) my watch lights up and displays media controls and stays on until I notice it and dismiss it.  This really eats through my precious battery life.",
        "It has been more than 3 years I had this watch. Today it dies out. Good times. Will I buy another android wear? No. Got too much devices to charge. Back to old reliable edifice. 3 years and still running out of the box. My 2015 moto 360 had a good run üëç",
        "My phone recognizes and connects to my watch after this app updated. This app doesn't do either. Phone bluetooth says smartwatch connected- this app doesn't even see it. Their resolution? Reset the phone to factory settings! *insert swearword here* NOT HAPPY",
        "The most important feature of android wear for me is the ability to receive text notifications on my watch, and that is the one thing it can not do. After each update the problem gets worse, I no longer receive any text messages on my watch. Phone calls, calendar events, and email notifications all work fine, but no texts. If you are considering an android wearable, and receiving text notifications is an imoortant feature to you, I suggest holding off on your putchase to see if google can straighten out this issue. I have 3 android wear watches and this issue is consistent for all 3. Very disappointed google can't fix this.",
        "Connectivity is a serious issue. As thousands of other people, I have a problem with bluetooth internet sharing (for Android Wear smartwatch) disconnecting without reason. It's a shame that Google's app should underperform like this and that no reaction or suggestion how to solve this problem has been given by Google."

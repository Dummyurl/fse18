        "The game auto rotates The game rotates anticlockwise, so the game is very difficult to play.  I understand I'm using a Huawei Watch, but I am happy to rate 5 stars if it becomes compatible for this.  Otherwise, the gameplay is very good, but I can't play it properly.",
        "Using a LG G Watch When the app is launched all it does is put my watch into landscape then back to portrait. It doesn't launch anything really just changes the orientation of my watch face. Thanks for making this game for Android wear though. Hope you can fix this. Because it would be awesome to have this on my wrist! ðŸš€",

        "Possibly best game on android wear",
        "Doesn't launch on my watch",
        "Very nice It's somewhat similar to Flappy Bird, but less frustrating. Very cool. Make sure to use the original launcher. It will crash if you use the Wear Mini Launcher"

        "This app is only able to take pics or shoot videos in one pre- installed quality, which is very low and good for nothing. Give us some more settings for the  with higher resolution options, maybe that would make this app useful.",
        "This is a message to Intelligrape Software - The software does not works well with portable device like Huawey watch using OS Wear 2.0   The image coming from the smartphone's camera is not visible on smartwatch display. Probably some adjustment is needed. - Thanks for attention",
        "Simple things that I need I can even see the camera from my watch. Feels like a spy.",
        "Very great app.. It's a very good app, but it needs some more refining, for instance.. to remove sound effect when taking a pictureüëç",
        "Very poor quality image. Functionality is there but development work needed to improve image quality",
        "Works perfect on Sony SmartWatch 3 and Xperia Z3.   Recorded video successfully triggering it from watch."

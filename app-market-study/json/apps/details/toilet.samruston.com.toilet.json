        "This app save me from having a disaster. Night before I had a extra large donner kebab with extra hot chilli sauce I had chilli sauce on chips and chilli sauce on the salad the next morning I was ok, I was pottering in the town centre the next minute I needed the toilet desperately I've got this app out and boom Saved me",
        "I am hesitating to rate wether or not this app deserves a five star. It would be nice if we could rate the toilets. Who are reviewing the reports?",
        "This app sucks. All the pics of the locations are inaccurate. Most of the places listed are for customers only. Good idea for an app but very poorly executed.",
        "Useless! It shows random houses as available public restrooms. What a joke!",
        "Why did you make it all white? You used to have good designs",
        "Really useful application. Especially in New York City"

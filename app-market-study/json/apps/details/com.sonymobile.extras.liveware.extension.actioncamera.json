        "Almost useless. IF you can get a connection, it takes forever. Once you have a connection to your camera, you need to leave the phone screen on. It gobbles battery from every device connected. Start/stop command are slow. I can't imagine a time when this would be useful. I want to use the Smartband to start and stop recording of my Sony action camera on my motorcycle helmet. This software is too cumbersome to be of any use.",
        "Does not connect Installs, camera app opens on Xperia Z3+ but SONY SW2 stays at 'Waiting for connection'.",
        "Does not work Not even an icon on the watch or the phone",
        "can't work in smartband swr 30",
        "Camera remote Does not work as remote for z5 dual premium camera.",
        "It would be better if you could mirror the camera on the smartwatch just like the smart camera app so you could see what you were taking without holding your smartphone."

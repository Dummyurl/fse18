        "Files, Settings, Help are not on the screen. Tried reinstalling and rebooting my phone twice. Right now the app is useless.",
        "An app for the researcher If you are looking for a para app that is easy, fun, and has lots of OMG! potential, this is not the app for you. This is a researchers tool for geeks and analytical folks. The only REAL para app on google play. Extremely boring app if no spirits are around. (Which is usually). Even the graphics are real boring, with a third of your screen blacked out. Tons of features, upgrades are great and inexpensive. Only .99 for the YES/NO commo feature. The dev keeps coming up with new inventions, too. Very advanced.",
        "I like it I was at my mom's house. When it got really cold around me. And my mom's dog looked up and started barking. I got a 12000 magus reading. Something was definitely there!!!",
        "This is worth it. I bought all add ons at the time. I was skeptical, until I used it. I got some kind of sound that sounded like a pencil scribbling on paper with occasional tapping sounds mixed in with it. It lasted about 2 full minutes! Try it.  ***update*** I haven't captured anything since that day, which makes me believe in it even more. :-)",
        "A joke but can't give u less than 3 I have the best apps and tools for watching, looking, \"hunting\"..I have lost someone and do believe in paranormal entities. You put together a great app some things are nice but others especially the add on purchase media and the EVP are fake and offensive. Especially when you take a pic hoping to see an entity and it's a bad pic of an ugly ghost creature..cmon...work on it..wish I could get a refund but I'll still use it for some things.. thanks with all.due respect",
        "Main Street Mall I work in an antique mall in Denison Texas and have captured several very high EMF detections and some very freaky voices and noises. The local news has come down to do a segment of the ghostly spirits that inhabit our building. During the segment I showed them my app that I use to detect the spirits in the building which is the Entity Sensor Pro."

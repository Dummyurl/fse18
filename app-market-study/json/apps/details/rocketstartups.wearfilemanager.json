        "Sdcard inaccessible How to avoid this problem? How can we transfer files directly into the watch?",

        "Lame :/ Let's you view files ON your watch but has no way to remove downloaded music, or other files and no phone companion.",
        "Meh Way WAY too much white space between lines, no display of file/folder sizes, no way to delete any files at all. Nice proof of concept but let's make it useful.",
        "Needs WORK... File VIEWER would be a Better Title.  No editing or even a Property Card with size, location,  & other file/directory information. MANAGER it's not ðŸ˜¨",
        "Useless. You can't access any folder of any importance. And you can't view it on your phone."

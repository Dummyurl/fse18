        "Good app need one last improvement Works well when you buy the app because you can add your favorite. now even there you need 3 selections before you can send your gps coordinate to your partner. a more straightforward solution and I would put 5 stars. the GPS coordinates sent includes the calculated address which is nice. well done",
        "What I was looking for, but ads in pro version Edit: I've purchased the \"unlock everything\" option but ads are still showing up when I open the app. Other than that, a few suggestions: It would be perfect if you could edit the standard message from the phone app to a few canned phrases like \"meet me here in 30 minutes\" or \"I need help\" or phrases in another language for non-English speakers or for when you travel. Other than that, great job!",
        "Update** Yes I bought all 4 upgrades :) prior to the asking and it still isn't applying the favorites ___  Favorites is not working for me I only get refresh and then have to scroll through contacts even if I have a favorite",
        "Deceiving This apps traps you in buying the version with the advertised functionality. As mentioned by others, scrolling through contacts is purposely made difficult so that you have to buy the version that has the favorites. Greedy developer. Avoid.",
        "Brilliant app!! I like this app so much, view all your contacts, recent calls and send your location all from your watch. Its really unique i haven't seen anything like this!",
        "Awesome! It's so fast to send my location from my watch :)"

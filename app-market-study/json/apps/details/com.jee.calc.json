        "Have to say that I like the layout and functionality of this calculator app and especially like the fact that the currency converter downloads the actual conversion rates automatically which does, of course, have its drawbacks in that perhaps you bought your currency at a different rate. Update October 2015 - I am still using this app and believe it to be one of the best available on the Android platform, although still subject to the slight drawback mentioned previously",

        "Wow! GREAT APP AWESOME DEV! Firstly, cheers to the Dev on this app! I starting with this dev's free app \"Call Blocker\", which was great! This Dev responded to my inquiries immediately (next day) & gave me a serious treat! If you need a call blocking app this newest version Extreme Call Blocker is so well worth it. Try the non premium Call Blocker to get a taste. Really great apps & very reliable dev support. I'd like to give this app 6 stars! (Never have I said this of any app before) Thank you J! Ian",
        "Great app, well worth the cost!! For months I've been using a different call blocker. My phone often rang before the block, my own calls got dropped, and lately the robocalls were leaving 4 or 5 voicemails for every blocked call. This app stopped everything. With the FCC blocked numbers option on, I immediately stopped seeing any evidence of the growing storm of robocalls. 10-12 calls a day for months to not a single disturbance feels like a miracle!! Highly recommended.",
        "Brilliant app and worth every penny. Just by enabling \"Sync to FCC List\" I've decreased the spam robocalls by about 85% This app is saving my sanity. Props to Grey Thinker. Wish I had gotten it sooner!",
        "The \"no voice mail\" on this app is not working. Calls are going straight to voice mail instead of killing the call. Only reason I paid for this app was because the person I was blocking couldn't leave a voice mail message. It worked fine not to long ago, what happened?",
        "Great app to stop pesky calls I have gotten over thirty telemarketing numbers in my blacklist some of these people had called 5-7 times no more thanks to this app.       9/25/16, blacklist has increased to 90 separate numbers. Thanks to this app I'm not bothered by them.",
        "Extreme is what it is Works for me. Installed on my SGS5. Read the instructions and/or the manual or contact tech support before you start critique. (My hat's off to John Smith) for his quick response time. I'm loving the app. Haven't got any harassment, robocalls or telemarketing calls since I installed this ap. Silence is golden. Every smartphone should have this app. No ads either. Google play says app has ads. That is not correct.   Ad free. So far 100+ percent satisfied. Well worth the purchase."

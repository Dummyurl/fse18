        "Perfect Display Just Finicky This is just what I needed. Its perfect.  I just wish I would have found it when I bought my watch. It is just very finicky",
        "Automatic brightness doesn't seem to work on my 360",
        "High battery consumption! So, I've been testing this app for the past few days and while it definitely works as stated, it also seems to kill my Moto 360's battery! I've tested it: one day installed, one day uninstalled, one day installed, and so on, then compared battery stats. Without this app installed my battery drop can be as low as 1.5% per-hour, with it installed it can be as high as 8.12%! It's a shame as it does seem to fix the dodgy stock auto-brightness. Has the potential to be a great app!"

        "Simple and great. I was looking for an app compatible with Zephyr heart rate belt and also with alarms for heart rate zone and training plans (like intervals based on heart rate) . This was the only one I could find. Endomondo has it but only in premium mode. The app worked nicely and has a simple and easy to use UI. It also connects with Google fit, which is great. Thank you very much for this app.",

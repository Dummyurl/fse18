        "Pretty unstable in my opinion. Feature request: One thing that is missing for me is that you can't see the alternate text for an image. For example xkcd puts a second joke in the alt= part. In chrome you can see it by long-pressing an image.",

        "If I leave the phone to go to sleep while reading an article it will close the app and article will be lost",

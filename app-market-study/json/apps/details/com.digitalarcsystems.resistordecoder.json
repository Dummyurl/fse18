If you want support for another language, please contact me and ask.Have a bunch of loose resistors lying around? Want your Wear device to tell you what values they have so you can file them away? You need this app!Simply launch the app and speak the color bands on the resistor. Resistor Decoder will answer with the resistance and tolerance. For example:\"red violet green gold\" -> \"2.7M Ω ± 5.0%\"Just tap the prompt to decode another resistor. It's great for makers and electronics hobbyists. As far as I'm aware, it's the only voice-driven hands-free resistor decoder available.Features:* Voice input* Supported languages and locales: American English, British English, German, Korean* Support for TCR (Temperature Coefficient of Resistance)* max of 6 color bands enforced* filters out 'and' if you list colors like \"red green blue and gold\"",

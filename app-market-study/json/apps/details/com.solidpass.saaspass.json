        "Great concept and a very useful app. Unfortunately I use Vivaldi so I have problems logging into google. In Chrome it works perfectly. The authenticator it's much better as Googles. Customer support it's outstanding. Totally worth to get it!",
        "Great concept, UI falls short, clumsy and cumbersome to configure and use.",
        "I think this best Google authenticator as if my phone gets lost then I still have it backup to my account. Which why I like your app.",
        "Very cool. Taking screen-names, Kickin' pASSwords.👌",
        "Needs support for gaming and other MFA platforms. No support for Android Wear. Import passwords fail for LastPass when there are Secured Notes or comments.",

        "This should be the official app.....not the other one. Great work anyway!!!",
        "Overall I prefer this app to the official Dublin bus app. App feel and layout is much better & I like the fact you can time a bus so the app notifies you as the bus gets closer to your stop. One thing that lets it down is that unlike the official app it doesn't inform you off last minute route changes.   P.s. it would be great if in later updates the developer could bring Google Assistant integration.",
        "Great app and works on my Huawei Watch 2. Very handy.",
        "Thanks for update. Hopefully that will now sort out the recent crashing issue.",
        "This app has become the app I cannot do without! It is wonderful!",
        "Easy to use app along with companion app for trains  to manage my daily commute!"

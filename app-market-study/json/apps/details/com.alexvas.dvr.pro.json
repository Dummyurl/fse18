        "Superb app. Wanted something to consolidate a couple of different cameras that came with their own bespoke apps and for various reasons I was completely unimpressed with several that I tried - then I found the free version of this. Scanned the network and immediately found and configured both cameras, the interface is highly polished and user friendly, it's full of useful options, the PTZ controls are brilliant... I could even flip the controls just vertically for one camera that irritatingly had them back to front just in that direction. Immediately bought the pro version to get rid of the ads (not that they're intrusive) and unlock recording and chromecast facilities. Very happy!",
        "I am dumb.I have a degree in networking but can't get any of 20 different cameras I've tried to  work. Sent 14 back to vendors stuck with 6. (Not including ring door bell in this statement, it just worked )... of the other 6 cams I got 1 popped up in this app... hopefully I might figure  out some of the other 5 tomorrow. ....",
        "Great app with its integrated features. But has limited support on some ipcam/DVR (like my Annke wifi ipcam with 4ch DVR model N441L). In my personal testing, using network scan - advance mode. It can detect the cameras using several listed model configurations in the database, but all fails to display a video stream/feed. All fails even re-configuring. I hope there will be more support in the future. Thanks.",
        "I have tried them all and I have nothing but good things to say about Tiny Cam. it works great all the time, better than the axis software I run on a PC and alot more features too. great job programmers you got it right! kudos",
        "I bought the app for the motion detection feature, which is not working as advertised. It should save footage seconds before motion was detected, but it save the footage after motion has actually passed, therefore unuseful content. I got in touch with the developer, but after some checks that the settings are correct he simply disappeared.",
        "Found this app works brilliantly with my SV3C cameras although they're not on the  list.  I have tried other apps including the one recommended by the  camera manufacturer and the NVR manufacturer but I  could never get the individual camera that triggered the motion detection to alert me it was always the same camera as if it was the default. This app alerts me from each individual camera that's detected any motion.   I don't have pan & tilt or audio cameras but so far everything else that I want  works and I'm very pleased with this app, hence I give it 5 star."

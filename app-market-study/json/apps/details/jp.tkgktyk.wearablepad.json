        "Does this work on anyone's oneplus one? I can control the cursor and the arrow buttons actually have the same effect as a swipe on the screen, but tap doesn't work and tap and drag doesn't work either.",
        "Does not work... I am able to get it to connect to my phone; however, single touches and drag and drop don't work.  Please fix.",
        "Doesn't work This app has majore potential. But it doesn't work. Whenever I open it up on my moto 360 it crashes the phone side of it. I forgot to say that I don't have root. That's probably why it won't work",
        "Works great Simple and does as its intended to. Here's hoping for an update with a better looking cursor though. Possibly the traditional mouse look or something.",
        "Good start. Pretty laggy cursor movement on nexus 5x and Huawei watch, it's not that bad very useful but can be better. Im confused is the arrows to click? When I try to tap in the middle of the pad I can only get the cursor to move but not to open apps and such."

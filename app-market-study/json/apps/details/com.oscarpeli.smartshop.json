THIS IS THE KEY WORD!!!Smart Shopping List 4 Wear too is the new app that will allow you to keep costs under control.The app tells you in real time if the product you're buying is the cheapest or the most expensive, based on your previous purchases.Provides you with a SIMULATION of your spending in all markets on which you have already made purchases.This gives you a chance to save money after only a few shoppings.A Very smart shopping list must enable the following activities:1⃣ Save all lists to have a record of expenses with price developments;2⃣ Allow a quick selection of products to buy, maybe with a built-in bar code reader;3⃣ Repropose the prices of the items if you have already purchased in the same market;4⃣ Got an Android Wear smart watch? Send your list to your watch! Grocery shopping will never been easier!!!5⃣ Allow to store items broken down by category and type of price (per piece or according to quantity);6⃣ Provide a list of charts to get a quick idea of the cost incurred, the type of products purchased, markets visited;7⃣ Allow a quick backup of the data for future use or for further analysis on spreadsheets.Smart Shopping List 4 Wear too allows all this! And much more!There are some keywords to define the strengths of the app:★ ☆ ★ ☆ VERSATILITY☆ ★ ☆ ★ Versatility is the ability to meet the needs of any type of user; the user perfectionist will be able to define in detail each product in every detail, defining name, brand and type.The less demanding user may also create its database in a more flexible way by including only generic names of products for faster selection when compiling the list.Clearly the two possibilities may be combined as, for example, at compile the list will be possible to select only the generic products such as: pasta, biscuits, oil, etc.. In this way, the compilation of the list will be quick and streamlined.Upon returning home, with peace and quiet, you can replace the generic products with the products actually purchased, so the list will be populated with all the information necessary for proper control of prices and costs.★ ☆ ★ ☆ EFFICIENCY ☆ ★ ☆ ★The app will be much more efficient as will be most able to automatically generate data enabling the fewest number of user's tap.For this reason, the app is able to associate automatically the last known price of the selected product relative to the market on which it intends to make the expenditure. In this way the user will only have to change the prices that, in the meantime, will have undergone a change.Clearly, this mechanism also allows you to have an estimate of the cost of the expense!Another tool that characterizes the app is the built-in barcode reader, if, in the process of creating the product, is also associated with its bar code, the compilation of the list will be a snap.

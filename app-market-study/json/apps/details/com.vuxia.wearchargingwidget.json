        "Doesn't even work After a day, it stopped working. I can't get the charging screen to show up without going in the phone app and manually turning it on, again. And I've rated the app but premium features never unlocked.",
        "It's a bit iffy... Have to open up the app on the phone to jump start it. Would be great if we could set manual location for weather. Good concept, just needs a bit more work to be a 4+.",
        "Nice bedside clock, no burn-in I like this app bc I can leave it on all night & don't have to worry about it burning in the screen. It's dims way down too so I'm not blinded in the middle of the night. Simple, yet has nice to have features like temp on the screensaver.",
        "Works great on the Asus 2 Now if somebody could only build an app like this to work in ambient mode on a regular basis, not just when charging that would be sweet especially with burn-in being such a problem with AMOLED displays",
        "Great app! Wish there was more screen selections. I'm back to getting the charging full alert on a loop. It just keeps sending it until you take it off the charger. Very a noting at 0300!",
        "Better than stock Better than the stock 360 charging screen,  mainly because I can dim it down to an acceptable level for overnight in a dark room. Doesn't always activate on charge though,  meaning I need to go into the app on my phone to enable it."

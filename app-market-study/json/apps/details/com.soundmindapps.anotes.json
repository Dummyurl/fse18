        "Nice application. Well thought, simple and effective. If you want to improve, do the following improvements.  That red button on left down corner, does not fit with the application. I suggest you make it either green or blue. You can also add a feature in setting, so user can choose the colour he wishes for this button. Also make possible to change folder colours, so that user can choose a colour for any folder from a colour palette that you will create. Five rating if you will make these changes, since then program much more professional. Good luck.",

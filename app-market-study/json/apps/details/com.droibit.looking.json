        "An app that Android Wear users should have, twitter posts are usually short and suitable to be read on the wrist. Twitter should have an official app but this seems good enough",

        "Ok app, however the hardware scroll wheel on my LG Watch Style doesnt work in the list views il the app. Shame! :-(",
        "Great app, but a couple of improvements must be made. The needs to be compatible with the rotating crown (for scrolling). We should have the ability to tweet or reply with typing, not just voice.",
        "Nice app, works great on Wear 1.5 - would like to see option to default to Timeline instead of having to select it every time.  Otherwise, best Twitter app for Wear!"

        "Excellent app. Use it all the time for checking sunset/sunrise times. As a personal preference I would like see the compass motion exhibit apparent mass/momentum so it behaves more like a real compass as it rotates.",
        "I really loved it for about a week and then it stopped working. Reinstalled it twice with no luck. Possible conflict with samsungs latest security update. Very frustrating because it seems to be a really good app.",
        "Works great . For the folks that it doesn't work for, your phone may not have a MAGNETIC SENSOR. One thing I'd like to see is display of  MAGNETIC to TRUE NORTH.",
        "BEST COMPASS EVER THANKS! I have been looking for a decent compass for my cell phone for 19 years! This IS THE ONLY ONE I WILL NOW USE. IT SEEMS to work FLAWLESSLY! Yes, I've had a cellular phone since 1989.",
        "Initially showed North accurately and speedily, after the usual figure of eight business. After accessing the colour settings it decided that the road North past my house was now heading West. Would not be persuaded otherwise in spite of repeated figure of eights.",
        "I had to calibrate it a few times before the compass would reflect the correct heading, but now it's on and very accurate. Let's see what happens in the long term. But so far so good!  Edit; Question, does this compass automatically set itself for magnetic declination?"

        "Works exactly as advertised, using Nexus 5, Moto 360 + GoPro Hero4 Black. Suggested features are support for ambient to save watch battery, option to remove some of the modes (eg. if you only wanted to switch between photo & video) and lastly potentially the ability to set up profiles to easily switch between video modes (4k 30fps -> 1080p 120fps with one touch)",
        "Works as advertised on Sony SmartWatch 3 and is a cool extension to the goPro app on my phone. Can only recommend if you are Sony SW3 and GoPro owner.",
        "5 star but... I hope it will support settings mode. It work fine though.",
        "App does not appear on my SmartWatch 2, anyone have any ideas?",
        "Not function on Gear S Can't use at my Gear S and can't refund too...",
        "H4 session with Moto360 Only the record button works. Nothing else."

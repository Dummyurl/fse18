        "Bought this app about 4 years ago and it WAS great. Since then it has deteriorated into a useless waste of storage. Laggy pointer, huge click delay, user settings not being saved correctly and reverting to default on app restart.",
        "Awesome app can just relax and not have to get up to change movies or tv shows anymore. Also great for freaking out my kids and their friemds when using the pc lol they think we being hacked or a ghost is in the machine",
        "Works well but does not allow waking pc from screensaver state. A bit annoying having to hit pc space-bar to wake-up when the whole idea of the app is to avoid using pc keyboard",
        "Great app, thought it was sketchy at first but works well. I get lag sometimes but my Internet isn't the best.",
        "The mouse cursor is jumping when I slightly tilt the finger, so mouse pad is not really working. And the app can't work over PC lock screen, so I can't enter my user name and password to unlock.",
        "I've been using this app for almost a year now , it's good , buuuut sometimes it just is unworkable the cursor sometimes has terrible lag and it's just easier to get up and do it myself. 8 out of 10"

        "Seems to be working well enough. It calibrated and displayed an image that was 2° different to a genuine mag compass. The needle did move around a bit even after leaving the device alone and on a table. Overall this app seems to be reasonably stable and accurate.",
        "It works great on my mobile, but it sucks in my smartwatch (ticwatch E): it never shows the correct direction. Also tried to callibrate in my smartwatch but my screen goes off and I'm not sure if the calibration is complete or not    :\\",
        "Great, convenient compass. Calibrating it before each use takes a whole 2 seconds. After my first two dozen uses it's never been more than a couple of degrees off. Simple & very easy to use. Nice choice in appearance/color of display.  This app is a solid winner!  And no ads.",
        "Free, no ads, works & looks good...could not ask for more.",
        "Some parts of town seem to make it spin weird but it ends up right.",
        "Best Free (beats most not free), simple, elegant, what-you-need and functional"

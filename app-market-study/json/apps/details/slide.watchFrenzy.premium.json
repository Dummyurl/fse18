        "Pretty good app. Works well, customisation appears easy and useful. Has a good selection of faces to chose from with plenty of user made content. Deducted a star as despite paying for premium i still get pop up ads.. no one likes ads especially those of the pop up variety. Ad's are acceptable on free apps but not on paid products",
        "I love it! The best and easiest to use watchface maker app I ever come across. Thousand of beautiful free faces plus hundred of amazing paid faces. I can spend hours everyday in the app looking for beautiful faces, creating my own and learning from others. I am damn addicted. Happy and proud to be a part of the community. The constant upgrade built confidence for me in using the app. Keep it up! I am loving it!",
        "I bought this app twice, first time it didn't come through in my card. Second time it came through twice. Looked to find new faces, all of what I picked didn't work correct... e.g. steps showing 18 vs 3k plus in Samsung health after walking my dog for 2 miles.  Seriously?",
        "The watchface I use have multiple timezones but watchmaker has broken the time zone. I belong to UTC+8 WITHOUT daylight saving but only UTC+8 is WA which has daylight savings so my time is always wrong depending on season. This makes multiple timezone watch faces useless.",
        "Do not purchase. Program said it would work with Gear Sport, but won't connect with or recognize the Gear Sport. Uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times. Absolutely useless. Worked well on Moto 360. Just a money grab. If connection problem is repaired, will give a 5 star. Would give a zero rating, but it is not an option. GARBAGE!!!",
        "Sort of ok. Kinda does its job. Just in a buggy laggy way. Unfortunately, thats the best I can say. EDIT, Ha, dev response hilarious. Report so we can fix. I guess 2 years of reports being ignored kinda makes me not want to keep doing It. Also notice his avoidance of the \"buggy\" comment."

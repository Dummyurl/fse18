        "needs improvement I'm using the LG G Watch R and I need to physicallt rest my watch on the guitar to pick up a note (both acoustic and electric). It has great potential and works when i rest my watch on the guitar but once this is fixed, I will give five stars. (also adding a feature that shows if the note is a sharp note or flat note rather than the number would be nice)",
        "Simple and effective. Using with Ticwatch E and it's accurate and clean. Unlike a lot of these 'jack of all trades' apps, this is the master of one. Opens straight to the tuner and being on your wrist puts it in the right place to pick up the sound clearly (though I suppose that depends on the watch model to an extent). I have a Korg tuner and this app shows exactly the same as that so it seems pretty accurate.",
        "Okay ... Except it doesn't exit properly. Seems to open multiple instances",
        "Off by -20hz Does wrong frequencies",
        "Works, but needs more functionality Needs to be able to calibrate A to 441 or other Hz. Other than that, it works fine.",
        "Moto 360 Perfect. Works great with acoustic and electric guitars :)"

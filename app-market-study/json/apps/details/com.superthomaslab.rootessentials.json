        "Great all-in-one Root utility. Only things I can really ask for are: 1. Adding Twemoji (Twitter's emoji set) to the list of available emoji. 2. System terminal with a pop-up for extra keys, similar to how JuiceSSH handles them.",
        "I absolutely adore this app. No more searching for the perfect root file explorer or build. Prop editor. It's all in one amazing application now.",
        "Lots of very useful features. Have had no issues so far. (Useful for editing build.prop)",

I tried to download emojis of android O on my galaxy j7 but it got crashed and I wasnt able to access my phone due to frp lock just curious that it is my phone or it was sort of glitch or it might have to do something with app overall liked the app,so tell me if it can be fixed by update.BTW My j7 is running on nougat",

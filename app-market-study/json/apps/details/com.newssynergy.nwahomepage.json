        "Unfortunately I don't have anything positive to say about the new KNWA app released on 6/22/2017. I've given it about 10 days just to make sure I just didn't like \"change\". However, it's just not very user friendly. Navigation is not easy, and you have to click numerous times to reach sports or weather. I won't quit using the app but hope it's updated again soon. Thanks",

        "Bitchin app",
        "It is very unstable also it has ads and when you want to look at weather one comes up and blows you out of radar screen",

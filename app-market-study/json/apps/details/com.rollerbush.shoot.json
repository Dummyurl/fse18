        "bought it but can't use iso and shutter speed. Samsung a5 2017. please fix this issue ASAP. otherwise I request for refund",
        "Excellent performance is the reason why I decided to pay for this application. But I have a question: Where and how can I change the resolution and aspect rate? Location and compresion of saved .jpg?",
        "I bough this app .I can not open this app.why?My phone mi note 3.",
        "GOOD: **camera shows great promise, **developers are responsive, **app focuses on functionality over gimmicks, **app is fast when it works. BAD: **app crashes unpredictably, **white balance setting on LG G4 does nothing - **app is definitely a beta product. REQUESTED FEATURES: (1) make white balance fully granular like ISO instead of jumping between fixed settings (2) ability to save to external SD card (3) bracket shooting like Camera FV-5 has -- customizable by exposure range & # of shots -- to permit REAL post-processed HDR",
        "Amazing!!",
        "Good and fast camera app But photos date are detected by Sony's Album app as taken in 2038 (videos don't have this issue), photos from other 3rd party camera apps never have this issue, there must be a date metadata (created, modified, added, taken etc) field the programmer forgot to fill. Also it doesn't detect my front facing flash which is detected properly by other 3rd party camera apps."

    "recentChanges": [

        "- Fixed issue related to some devices not being able to handle an animation (camera switch)",
        "- Fixed issue in reopening the app that a few users have encountered",
        "- Added a privacy policy (Shoot never shares your data!)"

        "Great app. It provides some great insight into how much you're using your phone. One issue though, when wanting to not automatically track location, unchecking that box isn't being saved. Every time I check back the box is checked again. I'm not seeing a \"save\" button so I assume that it's supposed to save changes automatically. Until that's resolved, 3 stars is the best I can recommend.",
        "nice idea but it's really limited in the ways you can browse the tracked data. the information is all their but you can not make use of it in any functional way. there are preconfigured summaries but absolutely no options to customize. if it were possible to set filters to manage what days is stored or even viewed then it would be much more useful. as it is, not useful if you want deeper insight then what is provided in the summaries.",
        "Good app.thank you, helps me a lot everyday in tracking my activities.",
        "Hey Instant, I can't save places anymore, help??  I love this app help me out!!",
        "Uses a lot of battery and processor power on my phone. Doesn't track sleep as well as it used to!",
        "good application.."

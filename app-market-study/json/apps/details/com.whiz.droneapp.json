        "Doesn't always work. No I haven't. Need to get with them anyway. It worked great at first. When I had an issue y'all did a reboot or something and then it was all good. I didn't use it for a while and then tried to and that's when I started having problems. At first I thought that it could have been something my job had done, since they had done some work, but it gives me issues outside and even in the parking lot. Otherwise it's great to have, or it was.",
        "So far the app has worked flawlessly. I was a little skeptical at first but I ended up renewing for a 2-year agreement. I like the idea of being able to start my vehicle from anywhere and of course the extra security. It would only change one thing. When starting my vehicle I would like for the app to ask are you sure? only because I have accidentally  hit the button to start my vehicle and could not turn it off for 1min. Keep up the good work !",
        "It is a luxury in winter or summer to have. That is when the app decides it wants to work. Lately the app keeps logging me. Also have been dealing with the app stating that my vehicle is running. Just to get to it and it's not. Or when it has me try multiple times to start it. Try Again, Log Out, Try Again. That's my favorite. I expect some issues. Honestly then to raise our subscription rates this year?",
        "It works to start my car. But as soon as it refreshes it looses the information and says my car is not running . It does not display cell signal or runtime. I realise some features won't be available due to what starter I have. BUT why does the information disappear after I refresh?? Run time is gone and weather the car or running disappears. Very glitchy",
        "Good app, best in the market in my opinion but still has its flaws here and there. I don't have the tracker active but I do take full advantage of my plan. The fact that you can start/lock/unlock your car from anywhere is amazing. Just gives me peace of mind.",
        "I am able to start my vehicle anywhere, and the GPS is super accurate for speed, and location, and trip routing. The app also tells me the battery level and temperature in vehicle. Works great. Works best on cellular network. Using Wi-Fi sometimes there is a slight lag."

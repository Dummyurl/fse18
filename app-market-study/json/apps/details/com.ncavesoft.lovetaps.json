        "Fun app. My GF and use this back and forth to let each other know we are thinking about them. Though I might miss a text, I always feel my Android Wear watch pulse to what my GF has sent.",
        "Awesome developers! Updated my review. Sorry it took me so long! I haven't been able to test it and all since I haven't wore my moto 360 in forever (work doesn't allow watches since we work in food) but if you say you added the functionality then I believe you! 5 stars!",
        "Needs Heartbeat Option Now we just need the ability to send your heartbeat with your Android Wear watch.",
        "really cool! My wife and I both have this on our phones, it's a really neat way to keep in touch while we're away during the day. (sappy I know)  I have the moto 360 watch and I feel the taps on my wrist just as she sent them. Very cool :)",
        "Cute app for couples The interface is very simple and clean, and the idea is more personal than a text message.  It's nice to be able to communicate even when you don't have anything to say."

        "This app is causing connection issues at the system level with my New Balance RunIQ watch (running Android Wear v1). Makes the watch unresponsive to settings commands from the Android Wear app and requires a factory reset for full connectivity restoration. Went through this a couple of times before I found the culprit.",
        "I dont understand why there's only city areas available. If you only need maps of certain area, Viewranger could be a better option and it's basically free.",
        "Works great on LG Watch Sport. This has so much potential! I'd love to see a Breadcrumb trail that stays if you navigate away from the map screen. A way to record and see your trip (gpx?) would be great too. I've purchased the app, keep up the good work. Cheers",
        "Great app, just what I was seeking. The only truly stand alone maps and navigation app for Wear. Pity there aren't more maps or an easier way to generate maps and navigation data.",
        "Fail to see the point. Why not do this by entire state or allow a selected map region to be downloaded similar to Google.",
        "In trial mode the wear app is completely useless. Otherwise it also wouldn't be useful, since it doesn't have city transport navigation, neither car navigation. If this app was made for pedestrians in cities, then you should at least add city transport option. If I'm on foot, and wanna walk somewhere nearby, then why would I need a navigation app? If I'm on foot and wanna travel somewhere, then I'll need transportation options! In the current state of this app is useless and silly."

        "Improved ambient mode",
        "Added night mode",
        "If your location is outside of the map but you have other map on your watch which covers your location, the app now will propose to switch the map."

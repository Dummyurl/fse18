        "Choppy Framerate I've tried playing this on the G Watch R, and it won't stop chopping along, doesn't respond well to my inputs and that's just not fun. Since I've seen other games run quite smoothly, I'd say that there's a lack of optimisation. I can't say anything about gameplay itself as the issues make it nearly unplayable (on this device at least).",
        "Very fun but laggy It has some bugs but what really bothers me is the lag.  If you can make it smoother that would be cool and this game is awesome for class and stuff. Keep up the great work!!!",
        "Go Moto360 I can honestly say this will probably be a game that I play more than once. It is fun it doesn't lag and it has pretty decent graphics for it to be a minimalist game lol.",

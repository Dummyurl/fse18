        "Interface looks really cool. However, there are minor bugs present like the navigation when you are trying to view a particular pokemon and its move set. Then, when you press back it takes you to the 1st pokemon info on the list which is Bulbasaur. It's annoying since scrolling is a bit slow. I wouldn't mind spending $2 if you add map feature. Hope you do.",
        "First off, let me say this is a must-have for building a competitive team or just looking for those hard-to-find Pok√©mon.  But as of right now, it does not have updated info for ULTRA Sun & Moon. I'd like to know when we can expect this stuff to be added?",
        "It works slow, way too many menus to get to your information and very clunky and cluttered layout! First make your app function properly, then focus on the beauty of your UI!",
        "Absolutely love this app rly helpful. My only thing is that you cannot look at Pokemon stats or possible moves when trying to team build so I have to go back and forth which can be quite tedious. But overall best app for team building by far",
        "It is probably the best pokedex app I've ever seen.... The facts at the start, the different filters help too. It tells you moves and shows you stuff like level or how to evolve, shiny forms, gender different forms, and much more. It is truly remarkable. Hopefully you can do 7th gen shiny/gender forms and 3D versions of them? Gym and trainer details would be fine, also an item list is at the top of my worries, I never remember what items there are and especially what they do. Also this is a minor detail but for the team builder can you make it to where you can decide what ball they're in please? Thank you.",
        "Amazing. Easily the best app on Android. There are a few names that aren't correct in English but they are correct and we understand what it means so that's no worry. Absolutely brilliant, waiting for Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon to appear so we can get a nice new update. Keep it up!"

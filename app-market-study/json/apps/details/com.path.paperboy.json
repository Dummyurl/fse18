        "Loved it at first but doesn't work anymore I use this daily but two days ago it stopped working and I got no response from the Path support team. Enjoy your 1 star.",
        "It's been a couple of days now where I cannot receive or send messages and all of my previous messages got deleted. In addition, this app was never fully compatible with Android system.",
        "Needs update. Hey devs, please make an update about it because basically its broken. And its not just me who is experiencing it, thank you a lot! I know maintaining this app is not easy but you guys can do it. Anyway why would you be in the position if you can't, ciao!",
        "Really bad !!! I e-mailed the support and haven't recievced a reply yet !!! When are you going to fix the problem? It's been 5 days now, I can't use any feature of this pointless app !!!!! And I have noticed that this lag only accures for Android users !! If there were less than one start I'd totally rate this app with it.",
        "Its not pratical Why I have to install different apk. path and path talk",
        "\"It's beginning to look a lot like Facebook\" (Don't be like Facebook) Please integrate this into the main app itself, so that i can access it by swiping right to left, or something like that. Don't want two apps, also bring features like floating chat heads (Facebook uses it but i think it would be a useful feature in any messaging app)."

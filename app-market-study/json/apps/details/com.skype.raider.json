        "I can't tell anyone more clearly.  Family far away?  LOVE YOUR FAMILY TIME? LOVE THIS APP! It's the next best thing to being there. My two grown daughters, 1 & 3 year old grandkids. They live 2500 miles from me, yet I know my grandkids will recognize and connect with me when I do get to go there. All because of the hour or more every Sunday we get to Skype. Thank You‚ù£ Really ü§ó",
        "It's a nice ad-free app which would normally make me go right to giving a 5 star rating. But when I sometimes hit the video button, the video feed won't turn off. Other times I'll try to flip to my front camera and it won't respond there either. If the connection isn't lightning fast, the connection can drop completely. The phone heats up BIG time during video chat (which I know may not be something they can fix). To say the least, they've got a lot to improve on.",
        "It is a great app, better than any other apps I know for video calling. One of the greatest feature of this app is it shows the text of another person while we are having a video call. This makes people can do another task simultaneously. But another problem I have, my phone gets really slow when I have a video call while texting. However, it is still a great app!",
        "Great app for video and audio calls. A little hard to figure out at first, too many motions for some basic features, hang up for instance is tap screen first then press hang up button but it does use all the real estate your phone offers for video. Call quality has improved to where it should be: equal or better than actual calling if you have high speed (5mbps both directions) so it's great for when you're roaming the world.",
        "Core functionality (communication) works well, however the UX is very poor. The icons (mute, etc.) disappear during the call and its not intuitive at all to have to touch the screen to make them appear first before choosing the icon I need  (and that is not that responsive any way) - very annoying",
        "I've been using Skype for years but the mobile app had always been unstable and unreliable. Since most people now use mobile apps it makes me wonder when Skype will start paying attention to users' needs.  Update 2018: how difficult is it too design an app? Still slow and buggy."

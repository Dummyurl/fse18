        "Now that Google Finance will no longer allow portfolio tracking I was looking for an alternative. This app gives some cool views and nice tracking including some great graphs. I would love to see details on all my portfolios together like it does within each portfolio since I can't mix stocks of different currencies within one portfolio so a full view is not really available. Plus I'd love to set the home page to see what I want right away. Still a great tracker for your stocks, just shy of what I use to have.",
        "Works well, and displays an all important chart of my entire portfolio, which it seems no other app does. I would purchase if it wasn't subscription based - a subscription isn't warranted for this kind of service. Now I'm back on the hunt for a similar app which offers the same features through an outright purchase rather than subscription based licence.",
        "Recently, the quote updates have been terrible on this app. I try to refresh at 11am and it still shows me the prices from yesterday. I use Ticker for all my watchlists and portfolios, but will be moving on to better, more reliable apps soon .",
        "Great app! A lot of info carefully organized with helpful widgets. Love the candlestick charts built in.  Updated: quotes aren't real time. It's useless if the quotes aren't updating until the end of the day.",
        "Was a great app so paid for monthly subscription. Now it's stopped refreshing or loading up the quotes, just frozen on the same share prices for whole day! Going to cancel my subscription! Shame",
        "It was great, but now it doesn't refresh stocks from MOEX (at random - some is ok, graphs are ok, but prices are out of date so P/L is wrong). Disappointed, 'cause it's really useful app. But no longer for me."

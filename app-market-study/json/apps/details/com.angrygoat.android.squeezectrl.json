Control your Squeezebox players from your Android device.This app controls Squeezebox players connected to a Logitech Media Server (Squeezebox Server) or MySqueezebox.com (including the server in the SqueezeBox Touch). Replicates almost every function of a Squeezebox Controller with an interface optimize for a touch screen.*Screenshots do not show album covers to avoid copyright violations, the app itself will still display the album covers.Formerly Squeeze Control.Owners of the previous app, please email me for a refund of the original purchase, if you want to purchase this one. Currently Google will only allow me to refund orders as old as October 24th, 2013.NOW AVAILABLE: Tablet Mode, requires an In-App purchase (US$1.00)Requirements: Logitech Media Server version 7.7 or better (tested with versions up to 7.8). A MySqueezebox.com account is required if you don't use a Squeezebox Server. You can create one from within the app or on the website. And of course Squeezebox players to control.   Features:- Replicates almost all of the functionality of a Squeezebox Controller, including the context menus and plugin apps.- Incremental list loading for fast navigation through the menus.- Works with both MySqueezebox.com and Logitech Media Server (Squeezebox Server) as the music source.- Automatic server discovery.- Customizable backgrounds for each player.- Works with multiple servers, players can be switched between servers.- Mini controls in the notification area lets you control your Squeezebox even when the app is in the background.- Song Downloading - download songs from your server to the device.- Player Manager for easy syncing/unsyncing of players.- Customizable Home menu.- Pebble Smartwatch support.- Android Wear Support- Chromecast support (Now Playing display only, no audio)- Can pause music during a phone call.- Support for device docks. - App Widget (home screen and lock screen)- Tablet Mode (requires In-App purchase)- Can be controlled by Tasker. For more info: http://angrygoatapps.com/sqzctrl_tasker.html- Available in English and GermanNotes:- For users of Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, there is a bad tip floating around about ways to speed up TouchWiz. It tells you to go into the Developer Options of your phone and setting Animator Duration Scale to Off.  Please Do NOT do this. Doing so will prevent this app from functioning properly and possibly other apps too.- This app can be quite demanding on the server compared to other controller apps and as such may not work well with a server running on a NAS. Complaints in the reviews about slowness is likely due to having the server on a NAS.  This is especially true if you have a large library (more than 10000 songs)- Use a wifi connection if possible. A mobile data connection would work if the server is setup correctly, but the performance may not be acceptable.- When connected, this app is constantly communicating with the server. If you're using a mobile data connection, this may incur a significant data usage fee.- Tested with the Squeezebox Receiver, Boom.",

        "Been using for it for years. Great app!!",
        "Found this as a replacement for SqueezeCommander which ceased working for me on Android 6.  Brilliant. Intuitive interface with deep control and reliable performance. I think this app, along with Michael Herger's continued support of LMS will keep my fantastic Squeezebox music ecosystem at the heart of my home listening for many years to come (well until the hardware dies).  Excellent, responsive developer support as well.",
        "yes, great app except the last update is causing it automatically connect to chromecast which has rendered the app useless. 5 stars when this issue is resolved. (Using my htc one m7 phone) another update today and the problem still persists.  edit:2-26-17~ since the last update, the automatic chromecast connecting issue seems to have been resolved! YAY! So it is back to being my favorite app for squeezebox.",
        "Used to be able to enter a folder to view it's files in library mode, now pressing the folder name recursively queues all songs to playlist which is not good for me. Searched settings for solution, none found. Assume new bug?",
        "Downloaded this app as a replacement for the Logitech Squeezebox app which stopped working. After using it for more than a year, I wouldn't go back to the Logitech app. This one is better.",
        "Works very well and is easy to use. I use it together with the equally excellent SB Player from the same developer. Both are well worth the money and are incomparably better than free alternatives.  I just wish it had an option to change Previous (<<) and Next (>>) buttons to move back 10 sec, move forward 30 sec, like PocketCasts."

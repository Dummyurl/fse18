        "Almost Perfect Would give it 5 stars if it also had a countdown to local solar noon and an option to set user defined locations rather than using the devices location. Other than that it's a great app.",
        "Super Sache. Gefällt mir wirklich gut. Aber hab ein Problem mit den Widget das friert immer ein und bleibt stehen... bitte beheben",
        "Top notch Excellent simple UI, nice looking widget with some options (better than none). Please fix widget refresh, or add interval option.",
        "Needs more customization. I don't need to be alerted a full 45-60 minutes before the sun sets",
        "Great app This app is so cool and the UI and UX is amazing with flat material colors",
        "The widget doesn't refresh"

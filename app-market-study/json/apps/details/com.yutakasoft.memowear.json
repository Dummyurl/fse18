        "Crashes Map opens up over Tokyo when I make a memo, no easy way to center over my location.  Doesn't even seem to start location services.  When I try to save a memo it crashes.  REALLY nice idea though, it is like manually forcing Google now's location-aware reminders.  Wish it worked for me.  LG G Watch, nexus 5."

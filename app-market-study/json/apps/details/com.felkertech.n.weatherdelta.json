    "description": "There are some great weather apps out there. They are pretty accurate, tell you the weather for days and weeks, and give you a lot of different numbers.Here's the problem with that: what do numbers mean? Have you ever looked outside and said, \"Oh, the barometer is going to be 29.3 in/HG today.\" Even if you knew that number, how would you conceptualize it?Weather Delta gives users a good idea of how weather changes. Okay, so the temperature is 60 degrees now. Over the course of the day though, the temperature will drop. It's really easy to see changes and each metric has a summary of the data. This makes it much easier to plan your day because you can conceptualize the change based on current conditions instead of absolute conditions.Powered by Forecast.io, Weather Delta is also really easy to set up. You open the app, and you get the local weather. It couldn't be much easier.It will notify you throughout the day if there's any significant change in the weather. The app also supports Android Wear. When paired to a mobile device, a wearable will get a series of cards which provide users with a beautiful weather station on their person.It's the first weather app to support Android TV. It can still pull your location and display the weather in a way that's optimized for a television.FEATURES- Android Wear support, with beautiful notifications- Android TV support, with user's location displayed on a satellite map- Change between English units and metric- Gets current local weather and analyzes change in a table or graph- Notifies users of weather changes- It's all about the user. You can change your comfort levels for wind, temperature, and more so that you only get notified of important things.- Want to wake up to the weather? Set Weather Delta as a Daydream.

        "Please add the ability to have a custom location rather than requiring the location services to be enabled.",
        "Can't get started with just Nexus Player remote Android TV support is great to have, but the introduction cards that are shown on first run cannot be dismissed with any of the buttons on the Nexus Player remote. I had to open the Remote Control app on my phone and experiment to find the only way that worked: opening the keyboard and hitting the Enter/Done button. Otherwise it seems to work well enough. Being able to see where the app thinks my device is located when in the daydream view would be nice. Does the daydream show more detail in premium mode?",
        "Please fix metric to nonstandard(imperial) measurements If your going to offer an option and push notifications based on it, I'd be a good idea to make sure your metric conversions work properly. I have 40° set as hot and 12° as cold and I just got a notification saying it will be very hot at 15°. Thought this would be fixed long ago but kept the app around and it still hasn't been addressed. Daydream also is just in nonstandard (I refuse to validate it) measurements with no option to switch to metric",
        "Doesn't work on Android TV Can't get past the last card on the welcome screen, it doesn't let me select the checkmark at the end.",

        "Won't run on Android Wear Watch Worked well on phone so upgraded so as to use the Android Wear app. On running on the watch, repeatedly says the app has stopped. Pity."

        "We lost our remote for our Sony tv. This app works really well with our tv. One criticism is that there is no decimal point, so you can't enter digital channels to jump to a station instead of just using the channel up or down button til you reach the channel you want.",
        "Not working/connecting at all and additional to that too much spam. Worst deleted the app in less than 5 min.",
        "I Love this app, when ever I misplace the real remote, all I got to do is pick what I want and the phones controls my television. but there are way to many ads",
        "It paired but does not work at all. I rebooted and it still didn't work. I'd like to know why it down and had me register this device when it doesn't do a thing.?",
        "I love this app, however I cannot use it at portrait mode on my phone. Even my auto rotation is on or off. I would like to use it as portrait mode, so please add it into the setting. Then i will give 5 starts",
        "When it works properly it's awesome. But more often then not it takes far too long to connect and there are waaaay to many ads. And for some dumb reason, when an ad does pop up, when you close the ad the whole remote app closes and you have to reopen it and once again wait a ridiculous amount of time for it to connect...and this often happens 7-8 times before it opens and runs properly without an ad messing it up again or without losing connection..."

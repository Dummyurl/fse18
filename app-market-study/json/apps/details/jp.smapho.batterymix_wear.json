        "Only Half Works Battery graph shows. App details do not. Tried every combination of taps and swipes. Android Wear built-in battery stats has more info. Are we missing some miracle way of getting more information in this app?",
        "Sorta works This works if your trying to ID a fast battery drain. But without keeping the data on the phone app so you can review day over day changes makes this a meh app.",
        "Worked for the first week I had it, but hasn't updated the battery level for over a week now... A good UI but the failing functionality makes it useless!",
        "Cant see app stats? Is not working",
        "Not seeing App stats, graph is OK. NB: Nexus 7, Marshmallow",
        "Can't show each App use battery status. How to see that?"

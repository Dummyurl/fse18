        "Thanks for your helpful response. I need to think about what you wrote, but in the meantime I wanted to add two more stars for you.  Original review: Can't trust latest update. Author claims just UI tweaks, but the app is now requesting access to identity info and photos/media files. Please disclose why you suddenly need access to all of that info.",
        "Very useful But not the most polished or user friendly",
        "Great HIIT counter for Wear intergration Great timer and app easy to use. Wish that I could make different length timers in the same preset instead of just one time length for all rounds.",
        "Great app Love it, just wish I could save more presets without paying",
        "Great app Do my intense cycles here. Very useful",
        "Great app! But I have one suggestion This app is great, but I would recommend that a timer in between sets be added. I use it for hangboarding, and being able to time out a 3 min. rest between sets of grips."

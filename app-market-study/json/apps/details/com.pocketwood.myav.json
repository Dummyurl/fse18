        "Great app and the best customer service I've ever seen.  Love it!",
        "Great app and works with TV, BD and SKY Q. I had to manually add in my TV, Sony Bravia 50\", and it worked with the Bravia 2015 4K profile. The front-end could do with a huge overhaul, looks like it's been put together in Android studio in 10 min. If you're charging this much for the app, hire a designer on contract.",
        "works perfectly with my virgin v6 boxes and at the same time control my TV with same app 5*",
        "Fast forward and rewind for Sky Q has suddenly stopped working!!! Other than this the app is amazing and works perfectly...great alternative to a remote control",
        "Been using this app for 2 years quite happily. Upgraded my TiVo to Virgin's V6 box today, had to manually set the IP address, but once done send to be working fine."

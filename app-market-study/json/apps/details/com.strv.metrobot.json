        "Great idea, but a bit limited. Exactly what I have been looking for. However, to be useful for Prague it should have buses and trams as well. The metro goes so frequently that the use of the app is very limited otherwise.",
        "Excellent app, I've been using this on my commute to and from work and my shift times sometimes mean I travel when there is only one train every 10 minutes.   The Samsung Watch support is excellent but do you have any plans to extend this to Samsung Gear devices? I have a Gear S3 I would love to get this app working with.  Cheers.",
        "Inaccurate For the station closest to my house, it's off by about 4 minutes. Just missed the train to work. BART says next train is in 18 minutes, this says 23.",
        "Signál Skvělé, díky vývojářům! Škoda jen, že je díky v podstatě nulovému pokrytí metra připojením do Internetu aplikace nepoužitelná :-(",
        "Great look and functionality, but as others have said,  you can't trust the schedule for BART.  I missed by train because of it.",

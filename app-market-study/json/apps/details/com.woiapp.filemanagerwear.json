        "Still needs tweaking You still can't see bottom icons on moto 360, even if the developer said it's fixed. In text viewer words should be wrapped to a rectangular area in order to be able to read them. Also font size would be very useful. No zooming on pictures. At this stage I wouldn't recommend buying it. Waiting for an update to review my rating.",
        "Decent but needs fix. Unable to view menu across bottom of watch display. Seen this brought up for months and would think dev would fix for the watch that has the highest number of users that would use such an app. Other than that it is pretty decent with decent permissions for an unrooted device.",
        "Pretty useless on the Moto 360.  The Moto 360 \"flat tire\" hides over half of the menu and makes it nearly impossible to view and select actions from the menu.",
        "Rip off. I paid for the app, it doesn't install on my S5 and Moto360. Tried to uninstall to get a refund within 15 minutes but since it won't install, I can't uninstall. Stay away from this piece of junk. Thank John Li for stealing my money.",

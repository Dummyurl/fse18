    "description": "The perfect companion for your next outdoor adventure. Seek, find, record and return home with Handy GPS.This app is a powerful navigation tool designed for outdoors sports like hiking, bushwalking, mountain biking, kayaking, boating, horse trail riding, geocaching. Its also useful for surveying, mining, archaeology, and forestry applications. Its simple to use and works even in the remotest back country since it doesn't require network connectivity. It allows you to work in UTM or lat/lon coordinates so you can even use it with your paper maps. Waypoints and track logs recorded in the field can be be viewed later in Google Earth.BASE FEATURES:* Shows your current coordinates, altitude, speed, direction of travel, and distance travelled in metric, imperial/US, or nautical units.* Can store your current location as a waypoint, and record a track log to show where you've been on  a map.* Data can be imported from and exported to Google Earth KML and GPX files.* Allows manual entry of waypoints in UTM, MGRS and lat/lon coords.* Can guide you to a waypoint using the \"Goto\" screen, and optionally sound an alert when when you're getting close.* Has a compass page which works on devices with magnetic field sensors.* Automatically computes the local geoid offset to improve altitude accuracy* Supports the world-wide WGS84 datum along with the common Australian datums and map grids (AGD66, AGD84, AMG, GDA94, and MGA). You can also use WGS84 for NAD83 maps in the US.* Shows GPS satellite locations and signal strengths graphically.* Can display simple or MGRS grid references.* Can compute waypoint-to-waypoint distance and direction.* Includes an optional timer line to record walk duration and compute your average speed.* If you have an Android Wear smartwatch, a stand-alone watch version of the app will also be installed.* Can be used as a replacement for the old \"MyTracks\" app.* Thoroughly tested by the developer on many off-track walksEXTRA FEATURES IN THIS VERSION:* No ads* Supports unlimited number of waypoints and track log points.* Email or SMS your location to a friend as a clickable Google Map link.* Email your waypoints and tracklogs as KML or GPX file.* Supports common datums such as NAD83 (US), OSGB36 (UK), NZTM2000 (NZ), SAD69 (South America) and ED50 (Europe), and you can configure your own custom datums, including local grid systems.* UK grid refs with two letter prefixes can be shown if OSGB datum selected.* Elevation profile.* GPS averaging mode.* Take photos linked via a KML file for easy viewing in Google Earth on a PC.* Geo-tag photos, and/or have the coordinates \"burnt\" into the image.* Show sun rise and set times.* Export waypoints and tracklogs to CSV file.* Create new waypoint by projecting existing one using an entered distance and bearing.* Compute length, area, and elevation change for tracklog.* Offline map support by downloading tiles from map tile servers, or using own map images.* Compute calories.* Optional background image.PERMISSIONS: (1) GPS - to determine your location, (2) Network access - for access to Google Map and OSM tiles, (3) SD card access - to load and store waypoints and tracklogs, (4) Camera access for taking pics, (5) Prevent phone from sleeping so that proximity alarm works, (6) Control flashlight, to allow the flashlight to be turned on/off from within the app, and (7) System settings, to allow the Android Wear app to control the watch screen brightness.DISCLAIMER: You use this app at your own risk. The developer accepts no responsibility for you getting lost as a result of using this app. Batteries in mobile devices can go flat. An alternate power source is recommended for extended hikes.See the Coordinate Master app for support for more coordinate systems.

        "I have had this app for a few years. My issue is that there was never a way to show \"track up\" instead of north up.  I could be missing something? I mentioned this I my first review, (no longer shown) several  years ago and was told it wasn't an option. Why? Both my hand held GPS units support the track up option. This may not be an issue for others but i find it hard to believe lm the only one that would find this usefull. Be cause of this I don't use the app very much. Your mileage may vary",
        "Used to work well. Last time i used it i found that it would not record distance travelled while screen is off (in my pocket). I walked 7km in flat open country with no trees, buildings or mountains around and it only recorded 384m as the distance travelled. There were no other apps that I'm aware of running in the background which might have also been using gps/cpu. Phone is a Samsung Galaxy S5.  Edit: Thanks for the suggestions, I did have a battery saving feature on. I will try that again without.",
        "I really like HandyGPS. On a work trip I carry equipment that is bulky & fiddly, weighs lots, and $100's of dollars. 2 hardware cameras, a GPS, cables, 2 compasses, a metal inclinometer. On days off HandyGPS is a really good Jack-of-all-trades that serves as well, and far lighter. Hardware capabilities vary with different phones, so I email Anthony with questions and he suggests workarounds. Lots of features - some of the criticisms I see in these reviews are from people who didn't look through all the options & menus. Hint - the phone's GPS eats battery (HandyGPS doesn't), so carry a portable phone charger.",
        "Great as GPS handheld - Needs a modern interphase, and  ease of downloading offline maps and also the GoTo waypoint screen should be less laggy. It is avery useful a GPS app.",
        "Can any one please tell how to import KMZ/KML files of google earth?",
        "Not sure how to start a track on my LG Sport Watch?? 4stars... 5 when I figure it out... just not enough info on the watch part of this app. Help please... LG Sport/S 8+ AT&T"

        "I'm an attractive person looking for an attractive person but for some reason the only men on this site look like my uncles- none of which I would ever consider dating. this is a horrible app. please give me my 1 month subscription money back, thanks.",
        "Free message and chat even you get liked prohibited! lol, sorry but it's ridiculous. This app is not bad but just want to pay for almost everything! Just makes crazy if you are not planning to pay for.",
        "Constantly shoves ads at you, even video ads that play sound and you can't skip.  Carousel is TERRIBLE. Get ready to never see even a moderately attractive person within a decent age range after passing on 100 people.  Constant nagging to pay.  Pay for what - this?!?!",
        "Just seems like the site could do a better  job of getting  read of old unused  profiles and telling  you how long a user hasn't  been online  as to not waste  your  time sending  a message  to an inactive user",
        "Tells you you have a bunch of mail but won't let you see it till you pay. Then turns out its just forward can messages from anyone you wink at. After you pay you get nothing unless its spambots",
        "good for matching but not good when it comes to comparing with other apps.other apps allow you to chat with your match for free .but here it not the case.and you cant do anythinh until you pay thier subs fee.basically,i will grade this app 3/5"

    "description": "Tired of missing notifications on your wear device? Then Wear Shaker is perfect for you. This app allows you to customize the vibration patterns for every app, so you can know what app is sending you a notification before you even look at your wrist.You'll be able to select from a list of all the apps that you have installed. Once you select an app, you'll be able to add a series of pauses and vibrations for that app.NOTE: This app sends the vibration pattern AFTER the normal notification. If you only want the custom notification you can block notifications from that particular app in the Android Wear app, but then you'll only get the vibration pattern and not the actual notification on your wear device.",

Every Sensor your device has can be inspected. Test your sensors with this small app, its only 60 Kb small and requires no permissions! This is the replacement for the original androsens app without any extras there is also an enchanced version with gps and loging to sdcard features, its also free. Its open source and its free cheers! GPL3 https://code.google.com/p/androsens-classic/What sensors are tracked? Thats simple to answer: all! Even Android wear is supported now!- accelerometer- light sensor- gravity- magnetic field sensor- pressure (barometer)- orientation sensor- proximity sensor- linear acceleration- rotation vector- step detector- significant motion degtector- geomagnetic rotation vector",

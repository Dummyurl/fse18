        "Such a cool app loved it for a long time. .. now it has this annoying glitch: when I try to add another location/city for concerts it cannot find it .. hope it's fixed in time",
        "For the most part this app is very useful, but the widget is what I use most and it has a few issues. For starts it always crashes if I restart my phone, another thing is the initial height of the widget is too tall it ends up taking up more space than any other widget.",
        "GF missed a concert here, I pulled up the next closest show and bought tix for her bday. Yep. She's gonna marry me someday.",
        "Painful and not intuitive to navigate.",

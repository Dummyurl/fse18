        "It's just ok! I mean , the fact that it's supposed to give reminders after every hour is fine! But the truth is that THIS APP DOESN'T GIVE ANY REMINDERS AT ALL!!! the only good thing in this app is that you can keep track of how much water you drank... But manually though!!! I would appreciate it  a lot if this app would fulfill it's actual purpose!!! ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜§ðŸ˜§ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«",
        "Does what I wanted it to. It's meant to remind you to drink and keep track of your water intake and that's what it does! Simple but extremely useful I don't think it needs much else, wish there wasn't so many pop ups but other than that it's all good!",
        "Incessant pop up ads. Every time the app updates itself ads keep popping up on the lock screen and upon charging. Other than that, I do like how it tracks both water intake and weight. Can't find another app like it",
        "I like this. But it will be better if you add water intakes depending on what liquid you drink. I am looking for a hot choco drink icon there is none. Then realized all the icon for water no matter what the icon is (like coffee icon) is not actually means you drink coffee but just an indication of amount of water drunk. Wish you could use the icon as what it is"

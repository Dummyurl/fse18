        "Is there any reason why the daily usage doesnt update anymore? It's stuck on nov 17th!! Helps me to know how much i need 2 for the next week",
        "Used to be great, but now the daily usage is just stuck at a constant 10kw, and does not update. Has been like this since November 2017. Disappointing really.",
        "As a much older person I've found this app easy to navigate, use & understand my power usage. Ive been able to track my daily usage there by lowering it. Making small payments & keeping up to date means no more large bills. Lots of discounts on offer continuously. I would highly recommend Powershop. Thankyou!!",

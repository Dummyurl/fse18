        "Great app. Easy to use and quick. Voice recognition feature is a little funky, but then again it relies on external API, so this is not the app's fault.  One thing that the app can really benefit from - adding a % on the front page, to calculate/add/subtract the percentage, as in regular calculators. Another 'nice to have' feature would be to have a memory add/view/clear buttons (on the next page, if necessary)."

        "Just updated and on some points it just crashed. On the option/more bang crash",
        "Really user friendly. Best bus app!",
        "In principle, I like this app. However some improvements are needed! (#1) - All bus timetables are not available. This is hit and miss, depending on the route e.g. H25 bus timetable, not available! (#2) - Adding a bus to the widget needs to be clearer! Every time I have a need to add a new bus, I have to search the entire app to work out how to do it again. Please use a '+' symbol instead of the 3 dot crumbs icon, it would be clearer. Also, perhaps add something to the tab where my routes are stored to make it easier to add from that tab. (#3) - I have and use 3 phones. I'd like for my experience of the app to be account based, so that logging in, pulls down my settings and stored buses from the cloud. Save me having to make changes on each phone. My updates should sync across all devices seamlessly. (#4) - The app sometimes crashes when searching for a bus or road name that is valid. Please fix this. Thanks for these long overdue updates. 5 starts coming when updated üëç apart from these fixes, great app!!!",
        "I had this app on my old phone and loved it. Since I installed on my new device it prompts me CONSTANTLY to let it access my location. There's no \"stop asking\" option so I'm having to uninstall it.",
        "Works pretty well except that the Android Wear support advertised seems to be nonexistent and why the hell does it need permission to make phone calls in order to remove ads?",
        "London live bus countdown is a very helpful app. It helps you know when your bus will leave and when you have to leave."

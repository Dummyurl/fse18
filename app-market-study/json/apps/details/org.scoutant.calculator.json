        "Nice design. Big buttons but 8 consistently doesn't work on tap. Moto 360 latest 4.2.2 (I think] firmware. No matter how many times or how accurately I press the 8 it only works 25â€° of the time. Usually restarting the app is required to get it to work.",
        "Not usable enough Contrary to some reviewers, I actually like the looks. However, when you're working on such a tiny screen, there's no way to do anything more complex without some sort of backspace button.",
        "Bit fiddly On my moto 360, I have trouble hitting the outer buttons. Might work beter with square watches.",
        "Awful - Doesn't work Pressed numbers. No problem. Pressed function. No problem. Pressed equals sign. Problem. Didn't work. Pressed it again and again and again. Still didn't work. Uninstalling. I can just \"OK Google\" for calculator functions.",
        "Lg g watch Ugly ui. Very basic functions",
        "Needs alt layout I installed this on an LG G Watch r. I also have Wear Mini Launcher installed and configured to swipe in from the right. This makes the '=' button on this calculator inaccessible - the Wear Mini Launcher steals the click. I reconfigured the mini launcher to swipe in from the left, and the calculator now misses the '4' button many presses. This is not really the fault of this calculator app, I know; it is simply a conflict with another app. But an alternate layout, perhaps no so near the edges, may help.  Unlike most calculators, 1 / 3 x 3 = 0.99999 instead of 1"

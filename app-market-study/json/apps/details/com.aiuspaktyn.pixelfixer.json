        "Pink line of death appeared on my s7 edge. Googled about it; saw a lot of people saying it is an unfixable hardware problem and the phone would have to be returned. But I came across this app and gave it a go.  I saw some people say it needs hours to work. I let it run fo literally only a minute. I was going to set my phone down and let it run longer but I just wanted to check one more thing online. The line was already gone and my screen was normal again. Awesome. Try this at least before you return your phone.",
        "Amazing! I was so upset when my new Galaxy S8+ had a thin green line down the screen. Ran this app for less than a minute and the line is gone! So glad I didn't waste my time trying to return the phone or get it repaired.",
        "I was skeptical at the beginning that it could fix the pink line on my s7 edge. And it FIXED the problem! I was blown away! Thank you so very much for this app. I'm donating so that you could make more apps that can help people. Thank you again.",
        "I had one pixel that was red. It could turn white, but otherwise it was stuck on red. Restarting the device didn't help, but this app did. Thanks sooooo much. 5 stars",
        "I have tried everything to fix the pink line on my s7 edge display for months now. I stumbled upon this on YouTube and it worked on the first try. Thank you so much devs, you just saved me $250 on a new display.",
        "Can i fix like bias on every corner on my screen.? When my wallpaper in black colour, i can see it."

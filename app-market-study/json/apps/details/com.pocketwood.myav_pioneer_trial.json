        "Works OK but there's no way to change radio stations, maybe add a couple of buttons. 8.99 for an app should have the basics.",
        "Thanks",
        "My VSX-1020 isn't wired to my network (I have no method of connection because the unit isn't wireless and my router resides in another room). I planned on using my J3's IR Blaster for control, but the app wont let me select a VSX-1020 without making me enter an IP address, and so the functionality won't manifest on the app because it's requiring my receiver be on my network. How do I fix this?",
        "Only basic functionality on my VSX528! would pay if it worked for my amp. No speaker configuration which is what I'm looking for as no remote control with this amp",
        "Awsome, Found VSX 1120 and set it up automatically! Shows surround settings and  volume levels right on screen.",

        "Got a smartwatch? GET THIS! This is extremely useful! I love how it tells you the weather for the week ahead and gives you updates if weather changes. Best of all, THIS IS FREE! Most developers charge money for this type of application. This dev is fantastic and it's a shame this only has &gt;100 downloads (at the time of writing this). This needs to be preinstalled on every smartwatch because this is the most useful thing I've used yet. Did I mention that it's free? Because it's free!",

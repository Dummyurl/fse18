        "Its really good, but.. I really love the theme, but I think I found  a bug in messaging (SMS) application. The font in message conversatioj which i send is in white color, when the background is white too. I hardly can't see what I texting before. Is that bug or maybe there's something I don't know about setting appearance? It's Lil anoyyed me, but you do a great job with this theme",
        "Very good Mostly excellent. Nice use of colours and flat textures. The in call dialer UI is buggy for me. It has broken, overlayed graphics. Everything else I'd working great. Ticks every box in CM theme selector which is impressive, especially with a free theme. I'm using it with Flat Style xposed module to get the matching coloured status bar. Awesome stuff. Update with optional, dark UI elements is great.",
        "Great theme This is a great theme for those who want a Lollipop inspired theme. I'm using this with parts of Blurred UI and they conflict a tiny bit, but they work fine with each other. I dislike the opaque Quick Tile background and would rather have it be transparent. The notifications for Gmail could also look better as right now it just looks as if it was shoehorned in there. Overall, app was nice but of course there can be improvements. Hope to see updates.",
        "One of my favourite This is no doubt one of the best lollipop theme out there in the market for free and better than many other paid themes. Just one thing. THERE IS NO GRADIENT IN THE NOTIFICATION PANEL IN ORIGINAL ANDROID LOLLIPOP. TRY TO FIX THAT. I love perfection.",
        "Great app! Best theme I've used on my OPO so far! Slightly bothered by the non receding on screen capacitive buttons when I play a game or something. But other than that really stable!   EDIT: After using this app for a couple of hours now I'd like to make a new statement. I'm not going to tell you it though because you should be downloading this app, get it already it's awesome.",
        "Feels like fire! 🔥 Unlike the normal holo/cm 11 theme, this makes my phone overheat like crazy! Too bad it looks amazing. I'll rate 5  stars if you could somehow fix this. (Used on an HTC desire 510)"

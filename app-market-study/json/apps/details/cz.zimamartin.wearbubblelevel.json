Specially designed for Android Wear watches, allows you to measure the surfaces whenever you need it.-Simple, yet powerful and polished design for both round and square watches-3 types of the tool (bulls eye, vertical and horizontal flat level)-Precise measuring with numerical angles (in degrees)-Adjustable ranges-Calibration for less precise devices-5 different skins",

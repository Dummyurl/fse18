        "This app would be perfect for me if I can manually key in the reference frequencies as I play in a bagpipe band and sometimes need to tune the bass and tebor drums to the frequencies of the bagpipes which ranges between 480 to 495 depending on the weather. Otherwise, this is a fantastic app whenever I need to tune my guitar!",

        "Not a bad app. Sometimes I want to enjoy watching Netflix or Hulu without getting up. It's also pretty good with Spotify since non premium membership using skip on the Spotify app to control the Spotify on my PC is limited.   However on my Huawei Honor 6. I have to move the mouse pointer slow otherwise the mouse pointer doesn't register my swipes.",
        "I've always wanted a TV remote for my PC with flashing animated ads that loses connection if more than thirty seconds passes. Lovely minimalist app with fifty menus and wonderfully designed interfaces that make controlling my computer like raking nails down a chalkboard. I'm concerned that your marketspace might be edged out by the fifty foot USB cable, or one of the hundreds of identical apps on the app store. You should make a remote app for every device in my house! Now all I have to do is press 5 small targets on screen, and pray to cthulu, and I can control my toaster. Or is the toaster roaster controller going to be in the paid version of your next app?",
        "This app works, but when I want to scroll, it pinch zooms, even when I've turned it off.   Edit: I found a scroll wheel function, but using the 2 finger scroll method would be easier if it didn't think I was pinching to zoom in or out (bare in mind that I turned off the pinch to zoom option in the mouse settings).  A suggestion I would make is a forward or back button for web browsing. Having to use my mouse to click back can become repetitive, especially when you're sitting quite far from the screen; it is a pretty small icon.",
        "Best available in my search. Easy interface. Not smooth mouse movement as compare to others but it doesn't mean you can't control it. Other smoothness giving apps hangs after some time and we have to wait for it to reconnect. But this app is not hanging this is big plus.",
        "Asks every time I open it if I want to upgrade which is annoying. On top of that there are intrusive ads on the mouse control screen. So if I'm on the couch trying to control my PC, it will suddenly stop working and I look down at the phone, there is a full size ad covering the screen. No thanks.",
        "Remote Desktop (Chrome)  allows full access and mirroring free, no ads!  Drawback; process to get set up, and only one can access at a time."

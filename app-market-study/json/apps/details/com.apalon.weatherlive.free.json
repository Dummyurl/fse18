        "Forecasting weather is not easy, accurate forecasting is probably limited to 6 hours in advance.  So like most apps its only as good as the data that feeds it. I will say that it was excellent when I was in the US tracking the hurricanes, Katrina, Irma etc.  Consistantly better than other apps on my wife and daughters phones",
        "A little worrying that the reply given wasn't appropriate to the matter I raised. The problem was NOT about accurate weather reporting but that tha app has a set response to good visability which it always interprets as GOOD driving weather. This could be DANGEROUS. It should take into account of ICE and HIGH WINDS too. This is a SAFETY MATTER so please address this promptly with an update.  Hope this updated review helps.",
        "Although the app itself is a very good app that i would love to give 5 stares for, the low rateing is due to the unrelentless advertising that is forced into your phone. Opting out is not a compleat fix.. If they get out of the advertising push i would gladly re install it.",
        "It's raining hard and Weather App says 10% chance of raining. I am going to try this for a couple days but I feel it will be deleted very soon.",
        "Does not locate where you Are, guesses the weather by showing snow every other hour for 24 hours. Total rubbish and waste of money",
        "Installed the widget and everything looked great.. Graphics looked amazing and I was happy.  Two days after installing the app, the widget started looking crazy.. It no longer displayed anything.. No info, just the silloette of the widget background"

        "Good one mates.... and all those saying you can't access it from phone via icon : do you guys even know how to use a phone ? This app can be accessed from smartwatch 2 app, it's that easy. Suggestion : add an option to choose custom folder instead of fixed ones.",
        "Works great, just wish it could display the time Excellent app, if they add the ability to overlay the time on top of the images it will be perfect.  Having to exit the app and relaunch it to see the time is a little awkward when its a watch.",
        "Good apps but 1st installed didn't show the icon after uninstalled then icon appear. Installed again and there are 2 icon now in my sw 2, cant delete the 1st one.",
        "Doesn't show on phone to be able to access it. I have reinstalled over five times and still no success.",
        "BUT And WHY I like it but when i download it why i can't see it in my icons/app",
        "Poorly created I try to get in but I can't open it.!!!!!!! Terrible. Really Terrible."

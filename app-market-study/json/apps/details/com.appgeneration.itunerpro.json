        "I have one problem with this otherwise great app: even if I shut it down completely, it starts out of the blue after I get a text msg or call. It can be very unsettling late at night to have an app blast music just because I get a message. Great selection of stations. Very few, if any, dead links.",
        "Selecting a country is not working. Pressing the three dots in the upper right hand corner does nothing to help this.",
        "No matter if I'm on Wi-Fi, or 4G the station always stops playing. Not to buffer or load, just stops. Can't figure out why as it happens for all stations I listen to.",
        "Please fix cellular network issue !! All stations stop work after 5 minutes when screen off in cellular network connection !!! In WiFi connection its OK ! Please  fix this issue in next update !! And I put the app in not optimize battery list ... I allow the app to work in background but same issue happened !!! My phone nexus5 Android 7.1 and nexus 9 android 7.2 the same issue ... Please fix !!!!!!",
        "I pay for the pro version and is unusable with android auto. I need to use the free one with payed for remove comercials. So I expect from vendor to fix issue or retun the money.",
        "Canceling my short review.  Tonight this app decided to be my Musical Alarm Clock: --I have not been using this app --I have never told it to wake me up --It decided 3am was my wakeup time.  The app is now uninstalled: You can't fix stupid.   as Ron would say."

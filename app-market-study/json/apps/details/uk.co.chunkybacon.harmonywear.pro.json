        "Integrates perfectly with my harmony elite remote hub, and gives me control with my Huawei Watch 2. There aren't many useful apps for a watch, but this is one of them. It finds all your pre-existing activities, and even gives them default control template. I wish the app could run in the background, but that's a very minor complaint. Great app!",
        "Works perfectly for me so far. Not some clunky itty bitty remote like I've come to expect. Very handy, very well thought out an all around nice app. I'm extremely pleased.",
        "Great app! And for free?! Perfectly integrates my watch with home system (Logitech hub). Remote always on my wrist. Completely customizable interface, programmable buttons and screens. But also pretty good (default) templates, takes over setup of existing hub seamlessly. Rare!",
        "Constantly force closing when I attempt to edit button configuration. App is currently non functional. Please fix.",
        "This is my favorite and most useful Android Wear app.  Pro version worth every penny.",
        "Very easy to set up and more responsive than trying to access commands through IFTTT."

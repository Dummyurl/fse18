        "Material design, custom colors and easy to use.",
        "Dev is very responsive and quick at solving issues. App does what it does simply, and well. Ads were unintrusive, and a dollar IAP was not a lot to ask for this level of support.",
        "Nice calculator for being on the go Nice quick thing to figure out the check",
        "Great Interface for Wear This is by far the best interface I've found in a tip calculator for Android Wear. I would like for the default tip and split to appear on Android Wear as they do on the phone. And I wish there were a setting to disable the split entirely. (I understand that it's extremely valuable to some users, but every restaurant I go to offers separate checks, and I can't remember the last time I had to split a bill.)",
        "Some improvement - reset on exit After trying several tip calculators, I believe this is the easiest app to use for wear in terms of inputting numbers, although my default tip and split aren't staying synced.  Also, it would be nice if pressing \"exit app\" cleared the entry so it starts with a new entry on restart. Currently, when I reopen the app, it opens to the \"split\" page and still has my previous entry so I have to swipe backwards and delete the past entry every time.",
        "Good calculator, monetized? Shouldn't hafta deal with ads on a tip calculator. Equal button slow to press"

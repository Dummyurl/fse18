        "Really very good. many years ago I wrote a Visual Basic application for iPaq (Archery Logbook) with many many things equals to this app.  This one is very well done, its easy to use, fast to record shots, and provides very useful information. I Like very much the ability to record the order and the number of the arrows then you can see groups made by arrow, and/or shooting order. You can improve your shooting, fine tune your equipment, and adjust your sight scope much better and precise. Using this application correctly makes your training sessions double efficiency. Thanks for this contribution to archery and.... When is going to be available for IOS devices too?",

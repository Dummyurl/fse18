        "Works even without watch! Great app, at start it asks u to install watch app but u don't need to, just back out. Works on nexus 5 running marshmallow v6.0.1 but menus like encoding error control level and character encoding type are black font on black background so cannot view. Not Worth cash until Devs fix this."

        "Cool idea, but mediocre execution and CRAZY expensive subscription This is a great idea for an app, and it's done reasonably well, but the subscription is insane. They're not providing a service, they're just unlocking a feature and *renting* it to you.  No thanks.  I might have been willing to pay a fair amount to unlock the perfect buzz feature permanently, maybe 5 to 10 bucks, and that's a princely sum for an app that has to do so little.",
        "Great idea but... On my Lg Watch r, in unable to edit the drink details. It just said \"Failed!\". Also, it takes some time to drink a drink so should I add the drink on ordering or on completion? I love the idea, looking forward to using it more but if you can help with my feedback that would be great.",
        "Neat App Just downloaded it today to play with it a little. I have a Moto 360 and it's nice integration so you don't need to pull out your phone to enter drinks in case your phone isn't right there. The one thing I don't see that I'm able to do is see my BAC on the watch itself. I can enter drinks but if I want to see my BAC and time graph I need to pull out my phone. I don't know how difficult it would be to implement this but being able to see this info on a small watch screen instead of my phone would be a little more \"discreet.\" Overall great app and I could see this helping to know when to say \"no thanks\" to the next round at happy hour! 4 stars now would make 5 if the additional data was on the watch.",
        "Possibilities!!!!! Nice idea.  I have a moto 360 and I would love to see bac level on watch.  Also heart rate would be cool too.  See how the alcohol effects the heart would also play in to a more accurate bac count.  Maybe a motion detection on a per drink basis calculating sips per drink.  So much potential for this app.  Keep it coming.",

        "Maintain the Perfect Buzz™!  The Perfect Buzz feature is now available! Perfect Buzz will let you know when it's time to have another drink to help you maintain control. Just set the BAC range you feel most comfortable with, add your drinks as you normally do and you'll be notified on your watch or phone when it's ok to have your next one so you don't have to calculate it on your own."

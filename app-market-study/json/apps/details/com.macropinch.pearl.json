        "Too many ADS. I CAN'T OPEN MY PHONE WITHOUT  ADS!  I don't like spys  Why does it need to know who I am calling & full internet access? Love the meter hate the spying I think all apps should have to justify permissions!!!!!!",
        "To be 5 star I would want larger % on the notification bar and the option not to see it on the pull down notifications.",
        "I am very pleased with this app, and I recommend it to all users. Although it's basic, it is informational, light, and its RAM usage is very minimal, which also is an advantage. To make this app even better, I would like to make a few suggestions:  1. Allow the Battery Alarm to be customized for any battery alert levels 2. Display the battery temperature and voltage on the notification bar.  Please and thank you!",
        "Temperature shows good but not always  in drop down menu  please show on drop down menu  for easy to use",
        "Mint Lov it tell ya on the left thouh there could be another app out there with the same but the percentage on the right",
        "You can actually down laod it because I love but it charges slow but who cares I I just like it"

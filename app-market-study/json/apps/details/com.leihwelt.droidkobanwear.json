TL;DR; This is a gimmick for your Wear, you probably don't want to play for hours on your watch :)This Game is for Android Wear devices ONLY! If you want it for the phone please get this one: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.leihwelt.android.droidkobanproAfter installing open it directly on your Watch using the Start... option.It is only tested on Rectangular Wair devices yet. You can run it on the LG G Watch as well as on the Samsung Gear Live!This is only a very very early release and therefor considered as BETA. You can play all stories and you should more or less be able to use most parts of the UI and the ingame UI. But don't consider this to be optimized for Wear yet.Expect the menus to be reworked, to follow the wear ux guidelines closer, in an upcoming release!In the meantime enjoy this Sokoban 3D game with more than 2000 levels on your Android wear device plenty of content to waste some hours :)",

        "Good graphics but..... ... Appalling controls. Player moves way too slow and you have to do a swipe for every square you move. Expect to fall asleep before reaching the 2nd puzzle.",
        "Fun but glitchy The UI defiantly needs some work, also after beating a level my character dissapeared. Overall the best game on android wear so far.",
        "Like it But some UI items are off screen on round devices (Moto 360). I know you haven't tested it on round devices but it would be nice... UI itself could also be improved. Overall it's OK",
        "It's cool to see the potential of such a small device. Thanks for the app! Oh, and this is the first 3D game for Android Wear EVER, so congratulations.",
        "Won't sync Hello, having issues with the app syncing to samsung gear live",

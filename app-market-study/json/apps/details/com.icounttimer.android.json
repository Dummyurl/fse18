        "Great app for timing stretches.  I wish I could adjust the rest time in less than 5 minute increments though.",
        "Does not save preference",
        "Best gym buddy.....download fast...gym lovers.",
        "I love it!",
        "Great Gym Companion I use iCountTimer every time that I workout at the gym, but I would like to have the option for time remaining prompts during the the rest period instead of just the last 8 seconds, then I could just leave my phone in my pocket, during the set."

        "Lots of fun!  1st person dungeon crawler like although it's not a crawler as in taking action movements.  RPG, leveling different stats weapons and sutch. Smooth play.  Basics in it own right. May be quite a jem. I haven't put lots of time maybe 1 hour at most at this point of this comment posting. It's is worth a good explore.",
        "Love it",
        "Not bad at all :)  reminds me of old pc dungeon games, kinda nostalgic.  Sometimes I can't pick up items though, even if I have a low number in my inventory. Health, throwing knives, etc. Do things only stack to a certain amount?",

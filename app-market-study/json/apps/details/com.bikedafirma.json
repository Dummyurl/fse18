        "Diversas falhas O App pesa quando aberto e sempre provoca algum tipo de perturbação na internet... derruba o Spotify, deixa o log de localização meio doidão... Isso não acontecia antes e nao acontece qdo não estou usando o App. Se vc anda numa velocidade um pouco acima da média ele diz que não é compatível com uso de bike (estao me subestimando... rsrs) Fiz cinco \"pernas\" de 10km. Só foram computadas três e não estão apontando a kilometragem correta."

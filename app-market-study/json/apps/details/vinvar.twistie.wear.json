        "Neat Great app. Needs a means to adjust sensitivity. I read complaints that people can't get it to work. On my g watch r, it is too sensitive. Can barely move the watch without it firing. Figure a way to calibrate it, and it is 5 stars.",
        "Does what it says After the original version not working on SW3 the update does. A much simpler way to take a selfie. I'd love to see the option to be able to switch to the main camera for better quality images.",
        "Miss this app since moving to the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier",
        "Great Works perfectly after update",
        "Twist karo I use 5.5 inch oneplus and sometimes I find it difficult to click the button to take a selfie in landscape, now i can do it using my smart watch. Wow!! Its so easy. I loved it.",
        "Awesome idea It just solves my problem of landscape selfies and it created a purpose for my moto360"

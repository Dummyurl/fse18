        "Great effort Very nice idea and I love that now I can see pictures and listen to voice messages on my wear. The only issue I have is on the t9 keyboard when u want to type a word with letters from the same block it doesn't switch from one letter to another.",
        "After much trial and error, I finally got this working...  and while I can receive messages and reply to them so long as I do so before they get dismissed, I cannot initiate messages, nor reply to messages that have been dismissed.  So 50% of the use cases for this are basically not possible.  IDK why the devs would deliberately limit their app like this.  And the alternative apps aren't any better.  I wish someone would look at Coffee's UI and functionality and use that as a model for a good wearable messaging app.    Uninstalled.",
        "Tried on huawei watch.. can type and reply whatsapp on the watch using the app, but the reply is only sent when whatsapp is opened on the phone.. kinda defeats the purpose of the app.. thankfully tried using free demo",
        "Works Well I use it for Facebook Messenger on my Huawei watch and I haven't had a problem",
        "Thank you dream code!! This is very nice.please add Persian language for keyboard",

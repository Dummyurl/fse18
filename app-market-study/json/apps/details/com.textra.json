        "Your program is full-featured with a relatively easy user interface! The interface is only slightly complicated because your program is so rich in features. I am thoroughly impressed that you after the add free. Only ask$3.49. Thank you so much for a wonderful app at and Incredibly affordable price. My wife and I have shelved Messages (the SMS app that came installed on our Galaxy S8 phones) and use Tectra exclusively.",
        "I came from imessage to Samsung's texting app and I eventually stumbled onto this app and I'm blown away by how customizable EVERYTHING is. I'm actually stunned. Notifications are so custom that I almost never actually go into the app to use it. Free trial does expire and ads do arrive but I instantly purchased the full app. It was cheap and I'll GLADLY support these devs.",
        "Can't say enough good things. It's interface is beautiful and simple but with plenty of customizations. I don't pay to unlock/remive ads on many apps but I did with this one because I want to see it supported and it's my daily driver.",
        "Wonderful app I've had installed since its first release. Went premium instantly. Can't say there's a more fluid or feature filled messaging application.",
        "Great! The main thing I can see that it could benefit from would be a location sharing feature. I used that a lot with Android Messaging and miss that function. The gif search isn't always great but it's way better than Android Messaging.",
        "This app has everything and more, has great Gifs and voice text for safety and great group sharing.   The developers will add anyting you ask for if it makes sense!"

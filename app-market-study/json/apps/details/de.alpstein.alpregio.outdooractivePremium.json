        "Used it for hikes in Mallorca and La Palma. Couple of small usability issues, but quite servicable. Seems to still want to download maps even for saved routes.",
        "Perfect for outdoor activities. Easy to plan trails and save offline on your phone. Navigation features still have room for improvement",
        "Plan & Do & Save & Publish Outdooractivities incl. Offline maps. Synchronization and planning on PC possible. The best apk for alpine countries. Hoping other world parts & countries will be added later.",
        "Seems to be a comprehensive app, still learning to use it.",
        "Easy to use and great offline mode to save mobile data charges and when signals disappear.",
        "a bit disappointed by the offline maps. why is there a limit of 40x40km?  I understand that this is enough for a walk, but I would like to download the map of my region at once instead of downloading every time small parts"

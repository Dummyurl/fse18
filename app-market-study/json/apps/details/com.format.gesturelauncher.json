        "Wear Gesture Launcher lets you start an app with a simple tap-then-gesture combination.  It should work with almost any watch face.  It is faster than any other launcher I have used.  This launcher solves a fundamental problem with Wear launchers.  The user interface on a watch is just never going to be good at selecting one item from a large collection.  Wear Gesture Launcher eliminates the need to display everything you could choose by letting you create your own gestures for the apps you use regularly.  Wear Gesture Launcher works very well.  It's easy to set up, fast to use, and reliable.  It is not intended to replace the default launcher entirely, but it does eliminate the need to use it at least 90% of the time for me.",
        "Well I have to say that this is one clever application and what a great idea. Seems to work very well indeed and I look forward to seeing new updates in the future..... excellent!!!",

        "So far so good and very handy. I live in a rural area and my signal changes at times. Thank you for this!",
        "Automatic dismiss I enjoy these notifications; but all I want is them to automatically dismiss after a few seconds!!!",
        "Buggy First time it showed up on my watch was almost 3 days after installation. Even then, it kept showing my cell network strength as emergency only. And it never notifies me when my WiFi disconnects.",
        "Buggy App keeps crashing on me about 15 times a day or worse. Some times it locks up my lg g watch r and I have to totally reboot it. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with android 5.0.1 and running 5.1.1 on my watch.",
        "Great idea, wish it worked I have an lg g watch and the app will not show and notifications.  Maybe the next version."

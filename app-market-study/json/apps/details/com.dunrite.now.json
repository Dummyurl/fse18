        "Half As Much Left '-' Pretty Sure I Paid For This App & it was provided MUCH MORE.. NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO . AND MANY MORE REMOVED.. Are benefit to developer must have changed.. So we have been RIPPED OFF",
        "Like the wallpapers but am disappointed because several wallpapers were removed several months ago with little to no explanation as to why. Furthermore, since then no new wall papers have been added to make up for this. If more papers are added I will happily revise this review.",
        "Some nice wallpapers, but not good enough selection for a paid app. Also, only 1080p resolution on many papers, which is horrible as they have to be applied vertically this resulting in a totally un-sharp image when applied to anything other than a 720p screen.",
        "Needs more variety. It's been years since anything new was added. Have grown bored with existing options and moved on.",
        "Used to be better Pls add the ability to auto change scenes according to the time, and that the wallpapers are downloaded locally instead of having to get it online every time we wanna change",
        "This app hasn't been updated for more than a year. No new wallpapers, and some of the old ones were removed. Any luck that the author is still interested in his offspring?"

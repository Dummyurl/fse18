        "I can't get it to connect to fitbit. I just get a long error message and no indication that it's being worked on. Is this app still supported? I love this idea but no one has followed through well on it yet. Please fix soon, thanks!",
        "Great concept, but poor execution. The app crashes frequently, notifications seem to appear multiple times for the same thing, and the interface feels clunky. The \"tutorial\" explains very little about the game, and I had to visit the kickstarter page to get a description of the different stats. Energy drains absurdly fast, such that your bot runs out of energy if left alone for even 5 minutes. Perhaps this is part of the game design, but it doesn't make for a great experience. I love the idea of this game, but I don't enjoy the app as it exists currently.",
        "Crashes a lot Crashes a lot, freezes up my smartwatch (moto 360 1st gen) and doesn't count my steps. I don't totally understand how to use it. Shouldn't it just be like a pedometer. I wanted the cat, it gave me the cat but then reset it when I opened it on my watch to the Android guy...",
        "Setup is broken Seems very interesting, but the setup does not seem to be working right now. Was this abandoned?",
        "I want to like this, that's why I supported the kickstarter campaign. But when I try to connect my fitbit I get an error page.",
        "I really like the idea! Slightly lacking functionality wise, yet then again nice and simple. Kills ny battery sadly :/"

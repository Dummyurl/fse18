        "Works perfectly. People need to stop complaining about the ads. Pay the very small fee to get rid of the ads, it's as easy as that. Also, several people say they shouldn't have to pay becsuse they paid for the TV. That makes no sense, Samsung didn't make the app ðŸ™„",
        "If I was sure that the payment to remove ads was onetime only, it would be definitely worth it, but they say \"Subscribe\" and for paying that monthly it is not worth at all... I was not able to find anywhere the information about the payment - one time only or periodic...? Does anyone know?",
        "I paid for a Samsung tv. The remotes are built so thin they break. And I have to deal with ads to use it? I think we should be able to use it regardless. We obviously all paid for the Samsung TV",
        "I've used other apps that I'd have to sync every time I'd use it & the ads took over my phone!!  Soo frustrating however this app has to ''find tv'' ads are there not too bad. Easy, to use so makes my life lots easier!!",
        "It too took long to connect with my tv. Everytime I leave the app and need to go back in, I have to wait until it connects again before I can use it. It has so many ads and once the ad is done and I dismiss the ad, the app closes and I have to wait for it to connect again. I pray another ad doesn't appear. I did not like this app.",
        "Paid app is well worth it, thanks for finally adding it.  Our youngest threw away our remote and we installed this as a temporary measure.  Once we realized how much less TV the kids watched when they no longer had control of the remote, we stuck with the app.  Probably the best .99 cents I've ever spent.  Thanks!"

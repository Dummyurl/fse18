        "I really like this app but as of today i have a real problem with it! I've been seeing this guy popping up on all kinds of apps in their feeds named Tom Steyer and he's trying to get people to sign a petition for people to impeach president Trump! I don't think people want to see this political garbage he's putting out there on our feeds in our apps! I sure don't and if it continues I'll be forced to uninstall this app or any others i see this trash in! ðŸ˜’",
        "A lot of the same stuff over and over. You frequently say how great an app is and yet many of them are rated garbage. It's more ads these days than useful information. What happened to you?",
        "This is a must have. Gives me great tips, ideas, and info for my specific phone. Plus teaches me how to do things i never even knew i could do on it. Like i said AMAZING!!",
        "Same old stuff over and over. Hyperbolic praise for apps that get poor ratings on the Play Store. I know it's only an aggregator, but a little editorial oversight might be useful.",
        "New phone recently and I look to Drippler for tips and the best apps. I have made the most of the last 2 phones this way but I changed the brand this year and it has already been of help setting up the new phone. I look forward to their articles and ideas. I've been with them for years now.",
        "The share menu inside the news is totally messed up. I cannot share them in major apps like WhatsApp, Telegram; because they are not present. And in the case of the selected app, it opens another application to share :-O."

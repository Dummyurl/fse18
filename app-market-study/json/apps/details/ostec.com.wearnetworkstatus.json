        "Disappointing Works OK. But it doesn't respect the do-not-disturb flag.  So even thought every other wear app goes silent (and let's me sleep) when I set the DND flag on the watch, this app did not.  Fix that and I'll happily reinstall and give 5 stars.",
        "Not all notifications work on Marshmallow Since upgrading to Marshmallow on my Nexus 6, my watch no longer receive WiFi notifications unless Mobile data is DISABLED, then WiFi notifications seem to work again.",
        "Pretty useful Can be a little buggy under Marshmallow and desperately needs a plain/system UI background.",
        "Works well Gives me a notification when I go offline even when I have ticked it off in the setting.",
        "No update in eight months Used to work really well but no update in eight months = doesn't work properly on Marshmallow = Uninstalled",
        "Kick ass app... I think it could be made slightly better in terms of stability but that might be just a matter of my phone using an older OS version than my watch..."

        "The app has just advised me that soon I will have to upgrade my version of Android to keep using it. Not real happy about that as Samsung hasn't released an update for my Galaxy S2. Please make the app suitable for 4.4.2 and above.",
        "This app is useless. It does not work. It worked off and on for a week when I first got it. But now all I ever get is an error:500 cannot connect with Aus post. I've emailed 3 or 4 times and heard nothing back. Crappy app with crappy support",

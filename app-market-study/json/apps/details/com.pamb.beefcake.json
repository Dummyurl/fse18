        "I would like to be able to track basic cardio and health statistics. Things like calories burned  and weight. For calories burned, I just want to enter what my treadmill or exercise machine calculates. In other words, I don't need the app to calculate it, I just want to be able to enter it as a statistic for my cardiac routine.",
        "I like this app for Android wear, but I'd like to see icon or draw symbols of the exercise. Thanks a lot",
        "Beefcake!",
        "Super simple and awesome",
        "Finally.. Great easy to use app that doesn't confuse you on every move you make. Thanks a million.",
        "Great app Used to be the best workout app on android, but I've since switched to the app 'Progression' which syncs with Google fit and allows you to set a different rest time for each exercise in your routine. This app has become more complicated without adding useful features."

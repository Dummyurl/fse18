        "Please add option to disable \"Add new event\" and \"Options\" icons on the widget. If I hide them, I can still click accidentally. P.S. If you put it on  your github, I can help",
        "Very nice calendar widget. However really wish there was an option to enable event text to be colored based on the calendar color; that's the one option I really miss from another widget which is no longer maintained.",
        "Great app, very customizable! The only thing missing in my opinion is the option to see and delete tasks (like the not very customizable onboard calendar app can) . Other than that, wonderful. Very useful",
        "Finally I found this simple widget which satisfies my exact need. 5 stars if date and event can be on same line.",
        "Looked fantastic on my Motorola RAZR M and still looks great on my new Moto E4. If these guys did a similar widget for mail, my UI would be complete.",
        "Great app bro. Very useful.  Can i request? Please add more language to this app..like bahasa indonesia.  Thanks in advance"

        "Disappointed it can't do all-day counting. App stays on constantly while counting. When you return to watch face, counter starts at zero when reopening",
        "Perfect counter No need to fumble with your phone to keep count when your running laps on a track.",
        "Difficult to swipe away, very small hitbox for exiting. Other then that, great.",
        "Simple and great Perfect for what I do. Thanks for coming up with this for wear.",
        "Wonderful Perfect solution for counting rows with knitting and crochet.",
        "Nice little counter but it only works on the foreground. If like to count things during the day and as soon as you return to the home screen, the counter resets. It would allow more tours of counting if the count persisted"

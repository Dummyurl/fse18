        "Autoplaying Video Adverts!!! Use it for the notifications. Very useful. The app is gorgeous, but main use case is for the notifications.  Which are mostly great.  The Weather Alert notification is a bit annoying though, as it always states Bright Weather as the notification (which is the app name) but it doesn't display the alert reason.... so it just reads as WEATHER ALERT: BRIGHT WEATHER. The other notifications are more informative, would be great if you can summarise the weather alert to fit in the notification title too.",
        "Updating? It seems to take a while to refresh. I usually turn off my phone and when I turn it back on the next day the weather stays on the day prior. It's like that for both my nexus 5 and 10. It doesn't correct itself on its own like other apps. Is there something going on that I can correct other than manually refreshing it? At times even a manual refresh doesn't work. Thanks for your time.",
        "Nice I downloaded it for the widget but the actual app is clean and classy.  I would however like a clear indication of where I am on the graph at the moment as it shows a 24 hour period and it doesn't seem I am at the same spot all the time.  It looks nice but it needs to be more clear. It has also been freezing up on me lately but not too often.  Also it is seems a bit slow to update.",
        "I have a few weather apps on my phone and Bright Weather is absolutely my favourite.  I don't know where Bright Weather gets its data from but the forecasts are always more accurate then the other apps I use, and accuracy is what its all about in my opinion. Add  to that a great user experience and I give this app 5 stars.  One thing I would like is to get a more detailed description for today's weather without being redirected to a website, would prefer it was embedded within the app.",
        "Beautiful but buggy The app looks great altogether and the weather display is precise and accurate. It is a pity though that German umlaut signs cannot be displayed correctly, these weather texts will bring up cryptic signs which are impossible to read. Unfortunately bright weather does not offer any language options. I hope that there will be a fix for these problems which I would gladly honour with five stars. ðŸ˜Š",
        "Good but I love the look of this,  clean,  clear and has a good widget.  However I do have some problems with updating (it doesn't sometimes and I need to force quit and restart) and I've noticed that the weather prediction itself can sometimes be incorrect but I believe this not to be the fault of the app."

        "Useful A handy app, it would be good if it could detect room temperature by taking the battery temperature and some manual user calibration for correction, say -10Â°, from what the battery temperature is.",
        "Works",
        "Nice and simple",
        "Great simple app for checking battery and CPU temperature Gave some feedback to developer regarding LG G Watch R compatibility and in return got quick fix for my watch and some sneak peek in future of the app. Great developer! Loking forward for future features! :)",
        "Works perfectly. And the price is right ðŸ˜‰",
        "Battery drain Im giving 5 stars because it works perfectly. However, after installing, i experience a rapid battery drain on my gwr. From 100% to 80% in 4 hours."

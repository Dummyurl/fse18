Notes:Not all application in the Google Play store have full D-Pad support. Just try what applications work best for you (this app is compatible with Android XBMC, Kodi, Netflix, Plex, Youtube app and many, many more apps in the Google PLay store). You need a rooted device to use this application. You also need an input-shell installed on your device. I would recommend installing BusyBox if you have a rooted OSAP device. If there is enough enthusiasm for this application I will continue development and provide more options, better graphics, a second app to install on your (rooted) TV Box. Thank you for your support.",

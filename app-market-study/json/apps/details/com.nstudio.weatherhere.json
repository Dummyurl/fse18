Products provided by NOAA are in the public domain, and this app's use of those products is compliant with NOAA/NWS terms of use.This app provides forecasts, animated radar, hourly forecast, and current conditions, all in an intuitive and easy to use interface.  Just the information you need, provided accurately, quickly, and for your exact location.â˜… \"A no-nonsense approach to show weather data on your phone, but done well and great looking\" - Android CentralThis app uses NOAA point forecasts from your GPS location to get the most localized weather available.  Point forecasts are great for climbing, hiking, skiing, or any outdoor activity where weather from a nearby city isn't accurate enough.  GPS on the phone will provide the most accurate location, but usually isn't needed.  Nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi networks can also provide this information, and will be checked first to save time and battery.  You can also enter a location manually.To provided highly localized forecasting, this app uses point forecasts from the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), and is therefore only available in the US.If there is severe weather you will see a red warning icon in the corner of the current conditions icon.  You can press this icon for more details.  This app currently does NOT support severe weather alerts or notifications.  NOAA is providing this service directly through cell carriers.  You can read more about the service at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/wea.html.There are also several differently sized widgets available which can be placed on your homescreen to provide some basic weather information, without the need to open the app.Forecast discussion is available through the menu button.Permission: LocationThis app requires your location to provide you with the most accurate weather.  This is fundamental to how the app works.  You can still add manual locations as well if you prefer.Permission: Photos/Media/FilesThis permission is required by Google Maps so that it can cache map tiles for faster loading.  It sounds like the app is doing something with your photos or media, but it is not.  The permission means that the app has permission to access your files (which includes photos and media), but does not mean they are actually being accessed.

        "I love it! Well I'm loving it less. My day starts at about 2am but I can't get current info before 9am. And I found out that although my current temp comes from 2 miles west of me everything else comes from a station 11 miles north of here. Here in Colorado the weather that far north can be drastically different.",
        "Very useful interface to the NWS weather information with well-designed and intuitive presentation.  Edit 2/28/2018: Still using this app and have been really pleased with the support the developer provides.  Great job!",
        "As someone who assists a family member with snow removal in the off season and construction during the rest of the year, this has proven incredibly useful. Love how I can add and monitor a virtually limitless list of cities. The devs have done an incredible job in compiling all the weather data from NOAA's site into a very easy to use platform. I utilize underground, weather channel and this app the most. The other 2 apps give an idea of what could come and once within 24-48 hrs of projected weather, this app (technically NOAA data) confirms what is to come.",
        "Love the app and the access to forecast discussions. It would be nice to access weather for other locations without adding them to my favorites.",
        "For sure the best weather app in the play store!!",
        "It's one of my favorite apps. Love the chart feature for forecasting. Accuracy is good for locations I frequently use."

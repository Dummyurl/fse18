        "Best audio recorder available After much trial and error with other recording apps, I discovered this one when I bought my Android Wear watch. It is easily the BEST recording app I've ever used. A lot more functional and very aesthetically pleasing. Also highly recommend the full version.",
        "Good not great I disagree with others who say this is the best recorder available. However it does depend on which feature you value most. Cloud storage is a great feature but it's not really necessary given drop Dropbox and Google Drive auto upload features. The must-have feature in my book is Skip silence. audio recorder doesn't seem to have it but Smart recorder does, and more features to manage quality.",
        "I think it worked when new I had an S3, now its a J7 (6.0 - Marshmallow) and didn't work after I upgraded the watch. It gets an IlegalStateException. I sent an email to developer and nothing. If you care, i just got a video with the error, but I can't upload it here",
        "I wanted to use this with my android wear, as I need to record lectures. The app is great for this as long as the max record time is less than 30 mins. Any longer than this , then there is only a 50 per cent chance it will get saved.",
        "When it works, it works great but the key here is 'when'. Have had more recordings failed ( especially the ones over 1 hour ) when trying to sync. Managed to get one, but 4 other recordings failed when trying to sync it and they aren't stored on the watch so they are gone for good when they fail to sync",
        "I bought the feature that allows you to record on my smart watch but it does not work at all. I have a motto 360 2nd generation and and HTC m10 which should be pretty new to use a simple feature. I get an illegal= message, then it closes.  Not happy at all."

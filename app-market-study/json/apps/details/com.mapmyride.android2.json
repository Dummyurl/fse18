        "Great for tracking your bike rides runs or walks. I use it often and now that I'm using myfitnesspal they tie together. There are a couple glitches with it when I pause, sometimes it doesn't resume properly and I loose part of a workout. Also there are too many ads making it hard to quickly log a workout.",
        "Since updating to newest version it no longer keeps track of mileage or distance and calories burned is inaccurate. App just keeps track of my time. Very disappointed, especially since I paid for the ad free version several years ago.",

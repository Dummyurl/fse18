        "I had purchaced this Pro version some time ago, now with the latest update, it is advertising for me to buy the Premium version for $19.00. What a rip since I purchased the Pro version before.  I'm going to stick with my Microsoft Office Apps because they are all free, no advertising, works with my MS OneDrive and all docs are automatically synced and useable on my Windows PC's and other Android devices and it MS Lens is a much better scanner program - better scan quality and has better PDF conversion too. Goodbye MobiSystems, you just lost a paying customer.",
        "I really enjoy the Pro Version. Does everything I need and doesn't force me to the cloud storage or cloud editing, like the newer MS Office and Adobe Elements does, for devices. They are no longer for me, and I'll never miss them with your program around. If you ever write this program for PC's, I'll be in line to get it, so long as it maintains local storage and runs locally without the need for phone or internet access. Win10 needs things just like this program. Thanks for the great job with this.... and hope a PC Version comes out to complement this Android program.",
        "i can't open most of pdfs and words. uninstall. but with +pdf editor(monthly paying) version i managed to do. i really don't know why. any manipulation? is it the policy? i uninstalled that too. now i use WPS office with which i am so satisfied. somebody said 'honesty is the best policy'. the same case is in your quick pdf scanner. no difference, but different name, and asking another pay. no refund option.",
        "It's slowly became reliable. Thanks to its good customer service. New UI is awesome. Update: there is a bug with pdfs. Every year I write to customer service. And then just drown in emails  and usually leave it. And use other apps to work with these docs. About 5 years now. All in all it's a good app and I already paid for it. So 5 stars anyway.",
        "This is the best office suite app I have found for Android. I use this on my Chromebook and it works just as well as Microsoft Office. I had this from a past purchase and was dissapointed to find out the fonts were separated from the pro app, and that they were now a separate $10 purchase. I reached out to MobiSystems and they were nice enough to send me a code for a free unlock of the fonts. Now I can keep using this app on my chromebook with all the usual Microsoft Office fonts, great customer service!",
        "One of the recent updates seems to have broken the management of external fonts. To see documents properly, I now need to re-scan the external fonts folder every few days, and even then I get a pop-up suggesting that I buy the font pack every time I open a file. All in all, though, it's a very good suite of office tools."

        "So far, it's awesome, I'm loving it. The only reason why I'm not giving it a 5 is because the last journal app I downloaded only gave me a trial period. So I'm hanging out for this atm to see if it stops me from writing. But so far, I'm enjoying it more than the last one which is what I was hoping for. Please don't kick me out! I need this journaling app or my life will be in chaos!!",
        "Looks interesting,  but it needs a bit of flexibility.  It seems so tied to Google services,  that I thought it was made by Google. I use OneDrive and would like to see backup and sync options,  using that.  Others use DropBox, which is also missing. For Fitness,  I use Samsung Health and also MyFitnessPal,  not Google Fit,  which is the only fitness service supported.    Straight away,  I was put off because I am not going to change multiple services to try this one.",
        "I absolutely love it but it would be great if we can add videos from our gallery or something like tag it.   That's one improvement I won't mind paying for. :)  Hope this is constructive feedback. Thanks !",
        "Please add option to turn off the auto detection of your current activity. It is always wrong and I hate having to manually change it. Would prefer to have it show no activity unless you want to add it. I don't like being forced to use a feature I don't want. Otherwise 5 stars. I paid for the premium and I like it.",
        "It is almost perfect. It will however be complete if there is title and categories included. Also one cannot search using the tags. That way, it will not provide easy access to one's entries. Please rectify this. Thank you.",
        "So far so good.  Does what it claims to do, haven't had any issues so far."

        "Awesome tool for tabletop RPGs. The only thing I could think to add would be the ability to roll multiple dice at the same time instead of rolling say 3 individual dice.",
        "Amazing App This app really helps when you don't have dice or coins but need to settle something.",
        "Polished Compared to other apps like this, this one is quite polished.",
        "Beautiful and useful Beautiful animations. Amazing instance of material design in a functional and useful app"

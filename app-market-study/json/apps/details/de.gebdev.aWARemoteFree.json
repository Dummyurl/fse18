        "Loving it! Using it alongside my Bluetooth speaker, and it's great. Only complaint so far is that reordering songs under \"Now Playing\" playlist doesn't seem to work quite right. Might be because my library is huge or that I'm using the free version. Really considering the paid, full version of this app regardless of what's causing it. ðŸ˜ƒ",
        "Almost perfect but one big mistake Unable to read Imported playlists. Playlist viewer will not work if playlist is imported even with pls, wpl, m3u or m3u8 format. Adding playlist to playlist editor wont be able to play song too. Dang. 100+ of my playlists weren't working. Solution can be made by deselecting use orignal playlist instead of a winamp managed copy.",
        "If you got Winamp  and are lookng for a remote you can't do better than this! Does everything you need, and is clean and faultless. I'm gonna buy it!",
        "Very well done Clearly a lot of effort was put into this. This is a very feature-packed Winamp remote control with a good looking and functional interface (especially the dark one). On the server/plugin side, the encryption, and the ability to actually remotely turn Winamp on is a major plus. Wish I could select which interface to listen on, but Windows Firewall works for now. Great job, guys!",
        "Cant edit or delete playlist in free mode. so once a playlist is saved, its there, even if you delete cache and data and uninstall. will give 5 stars if these features is added.",
        "Used to work fine, but now the server \"is not a valid win32 app\".  None of the older versions work either."

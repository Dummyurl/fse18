        "Makes random 2 minute reviews possible and fun. So you can Check throughout the day if material got stuck in your head. Customized gestures (e.g. easy or good for flick out) would be great!  Downgrade to 2 stars, keeps on lagging and hanging.",
        "Nexus 6, Android 7.0, Moto 360v2. Every time I open the app on the watch it crashes on the phone.   > update: I ended up wiping my phone for unrelated reasons and reinstalling Ankidroid and then Ankiwear and now it seems to be working.   How do I submit bug reports though? I didn't see any way to in the app.",
        "Perfect app. Bought smart watch just for using anki wear, and very happy",
        "Great app This is exactly what i want on my watch. Thanks! I'm wondering if it's possible to have the function to save some decks on watch. So that the app can also work independently without the phone?",
        "No longer works It's a shame, but I really liked this app when it worked. Since upgrading my devices to Android 6, it's stopped working on my moto 360."

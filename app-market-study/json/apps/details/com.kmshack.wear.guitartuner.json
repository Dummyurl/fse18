        "Normally I don't write reviews This app is awesome. I just tested it with my guitar tuner without any consideration that it would actually work. It did. PERFECTLY! I have no idea how this app is free but i'm glad it is. (PS I used the LG G watch)",
        "Wear in the title. Seriously people do you even test your own app? You can NOT use your voice to activate an app with wear in the title. It comes up \"where\" everytime and does not launch the app. Fix and get 5 stars.",
        "Great Idea. Not so good execution. The idea is great - a tuner that is visual and also vibrates when you get the string perfectly tuned. But it doesn't detect the notes very well. Needs more work before coming to market. Someone will come along soon with the beta testing done in house and not by the early adopters who deserve something better.",
        "Poor recognition Moto360 mic input must be weak. Also this orphaned a wake lock that caused my moto360 to get hot and drain battery life VERY quickly. FAIL.",
        "Cumbersome Auto mode does not work. Have to stop and tap watch for each string. Vibe on correct tune is nice. Not ready for Prime Time."

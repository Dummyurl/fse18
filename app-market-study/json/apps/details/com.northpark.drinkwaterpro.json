        "This app so far appears to give you almost an unlimited number of entries of liquid intake. All different amounts of your choosing, with a variety of drinking glasses and cups available. Plus it has a pleasing colorful interface. It is my present choice and recommended app for keeping a record of my water consumption.",
        "This app developer is very deceiving. They make it seem as though there is a widget for you smart watch when their is no widget. This app offers no reminder on smart watch for drinking water.",

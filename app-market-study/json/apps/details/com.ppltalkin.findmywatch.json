        "Incredible. I have a real old Samsung Gear Live, my daily beater. Obviously not Android 2.0. I knew I just took off my watch but it DISAPPEARED. It was still connected via the Wear app, so I knew I could install a watch app remotely. Google didn't offer any help, no! But this app did. The vibrate and flash didn't work... But the microphone did! It was buried in my bed sheets (hence no vibrate). Nice!! Donated a beer for it.",
        "OMG I LOVE THIS APP!!! LITERALLY SAVED ME FROM LOSING MY WATCH AT A HOTEL I WAS STAYING IN... IT WAS IN A BAG AND I WAS GOING CRAZY CAUSE I COULDNT FIND IT SO THE FLASH WASNT MUCH HELP BUT THE MIC DID IT!!!! I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP MY VOICE FROM MY WATCHS MIC AND THAT'S HOW I FOUND IT... ❤❤❤❤",
        "Found my connected lost watch, remote installed the app to watch. Like a game of hot n cold with mic. Fun finding watch after toddler had hidden it. Been looking over an hour before installing this. Then found in 10 mins. Job well done",
        "Installed the app remotely to my watch then it made my phone vibrate, make a loud noise and flash the screen. Found it easily. Haven't tried the microphone feature but the app is great even without it.",
        "Does exactly what I need it to.. I have vision problems, and this helps!",
        "To be fair, it is a very useful app for when you cannot find your watch, especially handy that you can remotely install with Android Wear 2.0. I would have been searching for hours! (Why one earth did I leave the watch in the bathroom?..)"

        "Latest update destroyed battery life. I had at least a month on a pack of batteries. Now I have a week at best. Fix this!!! It is ruining the device !",
        "I love Nuki. I have the lock and bridge. Pairing the bridge was not as easy. It wasn't clear to me if the pairing was successful or failed. Big issue for me although is that the smartwatch app does not work properly on my Moto 360. It says my phone is not paired but it is paired. Also I'd like to use my watch to open the door without having to have my phone on me. Let me know if you guys will do something about this",
        "Will a version be released for the Samsung S3 Frontier smart watch?",
        "Works great",
        "The app has room for improvement and I hope that they keep improving things. There is also scope for added hardware, entry pads etc. But all in all it's a great start and it works well.",
        "Geonfencing often not work, and the BT connection is flaky sometimes. Overall the concept is brilliant and I never want to miss my Nuki."

        "This is an update. App no longer permits reading in landscape mode on 9.7-inch Android tablet. Photo albums frequently omit important caption information. Other than that, it works fine.  What's below was written 9 months ago. The Sun app has worked well since...until yesterday, when it stopped recognizing my ongoing payments made directly to the newspaper. Now, it treats me as a nonsubscriber, severely limiting my access to articles.  What's worse is that the Sun's representative for mobile apps has no idea how to fix it. So I must downgrade the app.  The latest version has been stable since installation. Former crashes and freezes are gone; articles scroll smoothly. Compared with other news apps, however, Sun articles load very slowly.  This gets worse as one moves from the current news menus to the Obituaries and Harford news to the right. Sometimes it takes 30 seconds after being selected for a piece to appear. I wonder if they're using an old, pokey server?",
        "App is seriously flawed. Keeps nagging me to suscribe to be able to read articles, even though I am a 7-day print subscriber. And when I tried to send a feedback email through the app, the email bounced. Needs work.",
        "Better than most national news apps. Has local news as well as national and worldwide news. Has great control of text size and font. I can't seem to find the weather in this app. That's why I gave it four stars instead of five.",
        "Good content but terrible app.",
        "Only 5 free stories per month.  Uninstall.",
        "Easy to use, complements my weekend hard-copy subscription well."

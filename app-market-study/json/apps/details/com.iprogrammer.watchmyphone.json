        "Nice app, but... Using it with moto 360 and HTC one M7. It seems that GPS is running constantly with address tracking on. This will consume a lot of battery ðŸ”‹? And it is difficult to push Ring at the bottom of the Moto 360. At last I think it is a bit slow in detection of loss of Bluetooth.",
        "Highly Recommended!! Guys, If you have a tendency to forget your phone at home while going out, or if you are like me who always has trouble to find your phone at home like sometimes it is under the mattress, or in the bathroom, etc., etc...  You surely need this app, and you will love it!! :)",
        "Very clean UI Does what I would expect and looks good doing it. I would love to see this app get a feature that locks the phone when watch becomes disconnected and unlocks when reconnected. Otherwise great app to go with.",
        "Moto360 Please optimize for the moto 360. The screen is cut off.",
        "Cannot get to work Trying to setup on samsung S7 edge. Asked for the email address after stallation. When press submit, says 'No internet connection available' though it is connected to the internet. Cannot proceed further.",
        "Works well... Battery hog Works very well. One of the best find my phone apps for wear... But it seems to be a big battery hog. It's always the leading cause of my low battery in the middle of the day."

        "Good compass. The displayed altitude keeps disappearing. Also needs a function to select between feet or meters for altitude and inHg and mb for pressure.",
        "copass not running",
        "It is useless",
        "Fake",
        "Great compass, camera permission is for flash Shame on all you noobs who won't give this super awesome compass app a chance. The camera permission is used to toggle the camera flash (if you have one) in night mode. The features in this app are top notch. Camera flash can't be accessed without camera permission.",
        "What's wrong with it?! I wonder why this application (especially the Leveler) has become worse than it was before!"

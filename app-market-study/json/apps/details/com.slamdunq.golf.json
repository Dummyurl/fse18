        "I installed it but can't use it. The app tells me I need to register but every time I enter my details the app responds with \"Error Message Invalid profile entry\". Can anyone help me please? I just discovered this app and wanted to use it this morning but it doesn't seem like that is going to happen. I checked website for help or a FAQ but found neither. Very disappointed because it looked good.",
        "Doesn't work Doesn't capture any data from my swing even though I have now used up all my games available and I can't even log a bug report (says preparing report and will notify me once ready but never notifies me)",
        "Can't use the app without login and the sign up process is not working. The servers not responding error message. Wastage of time.",
        "Utter garbage! Doesn't even let you log in. Can't register, just doesn't do anything. If you're going to release an app, top tip.... Make sure it works!",
        "So much hope and potential is what I had for this app but as it goes with most of the free apps you can find it doesn't quite work I have a Samsung S7 and the Gear Fit 2 only will tell me I have improper swing did not get full action who knows",
        "Used to work great, but like others have reported I can no longer login. No error message, just eventually times out."

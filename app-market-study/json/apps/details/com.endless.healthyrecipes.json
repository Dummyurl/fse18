        "There seems to have good recipies but was disapointed alot of recipies are missing ingredients.  The categories also seem to be mixed up.  Was looking for salads and there was soups and bread",
        "Great to keep in shape",
        "Seems to include pieces of what I'm looking for, but rather inconsistent between recipes. Some have the calorie and nutrition info, some are unable to adapt the serving number. Wish there was also a way to stop the ads. I'd be willing to pay a nominal fee.",
        "I think that it is a very great and significant app especially those whom are trying to keep there bodies healthy and physically fit. It tells you many different recipieces even recipes if your a kid or have diabetes. Great app and I recommend it.",
        "I have pcos and have to be careful with what I eat, this app is so easy to use and so many different types and styles of dishes, I'm not much of a cook but the easy to read steps and what to use is great, loving it!!",
        "Great app to help with eating healthy and lose weight. Just love it."

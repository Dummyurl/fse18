        "Has potential. Does not keep screen locked so I constantly lose my score when my watch goes \"home\". Exactly what I needed if it didn't have that issue. Oh well.",
        "Great stuff ... But.. Easy to use. Tap to score. Clear display.   But...(only thing but big thing) ..doesn't stay active.... If you don't touch it for a minute or so the watch goes to sleep .... Should prevent sleep when in progress...  And once sleeps, if you open app the score has reset ( on my SW3).  Hope you can fix for more stars!",

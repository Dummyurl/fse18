        "Broken on Android 7 When I set the focus to the seconds field when defining a timer it immediately moves the focus to the description field",
        "Great app, nice simple and customisable. Only missing part would be to have it vibrate at the end of each time segment so I dont need to keep my eyes on it while AeroPressing. Then would be an easy 5 star and recommend to mates.",

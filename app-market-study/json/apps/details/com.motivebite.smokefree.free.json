        "Well constructed quit smoking aid. Simple yet good looking and easy to work with user interface. I've only tried 2 of these apps but this one was so good I didn't need to search any longer. Only just started my quitting journey, and I think with this apps aid I can stay on track and finally kick this terrible habit. Big thanks to the developers for making such a quality app.",
        "Cut down my stix. Not bad! Tried a few free ones, this one fits what I need - Set targets, easy to use, graphs, cost, savings, no intrusive ads (have ads), manual recording. BUT, will prefer motivation & health notification prompts. Can't ask for more actually from a free app considering I spend real money on smokes. Would gladly pay $0.99+ to support better development.",
        "I really like this app. The thought of quitting at cold turkey gives me anxiety given our demanding lifestyles.    This app is really helping me reduce consumption by letting me know when it's OK to smoke. I find other healthy pleasures (a video game, a walk to a smoothie shop, comfort food, exercise, tea and nap, etc) during the window in which im not to smoke.    Simple to use.",
        "Simplest most efective incremental stop smoking app. Not full of ADD adds yet worthy of a price$. I had something similar in my reminders but it wasn't weaning me to lower nic consumtion. 30yrs + 40 a day has me in danger mode.",
        "This is by far the best app I have used. It is exactly what I needed to regulate and keep myself from bored smoking. The notification can be annoying for some people, I'm not too bothered by it but I did go ahead and turn it off under the settings so I wouldn't feel urged.",
        "This app really help me cut down my bad habit. I just wish it have more log, or chart, or more detail stat to see my past day in how many cigarette that I burned, or how many hours from one cigarette to another. But so far, this app truly helpful if you want to cut down your cigarettes intake daily. Update: I try this app again because I'm starting with my smoking habit again. But after the latest update, I dont like how the app work."

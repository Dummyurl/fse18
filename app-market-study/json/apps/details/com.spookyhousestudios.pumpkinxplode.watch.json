        "Best wear Game! This is an awesome game with so many different ways to smash spooky pumpkins like over 10 modes. Easy to play on tiny screen. Exciting game, my heart races trying to smash the spooky pumpkins lol! Fun to beat old score perfect for when you are sitting waiting or riding some where and need to kill some time.  I have always erased any other game I tried for wear and stopped looking after spooky pumpkin. Plus it is fun to say spooky pumpkin!",
        "Very fun and cute game. It's a nice way to pass the time when I don't have my phone with me. I like how it includes different variations of the game if you get bored of one. The animations are subtle and very adorable.",

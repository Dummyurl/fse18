        "Best dice rolling for wear so far.",
        "Works well with LG Urbane Just got the LG watch Urbane and this app works pretty well. Obviously would be nicer to see animation of a d20 but all works well (especially voice mode).",
        "Works well on the moto 360 I would really like a 3d dice program for my watch, but this one works well in the meantime.",
        "Doesn't work on gear live",
        "Massive issues on live gear App is a great idea, but it causes \"watch is notifications\" to repeatedly flash on the watch and general crashing of many other things on the app, as well massive battery drain. I'm assuming it's some kind of looping crash or looping logic that's causing the issue. Sorry to say had to reset my watch to factory twice because of this application. Oh and it doesn't like to remove itself. Stays resident when application removed from phone, and just shows a loading screen for thirty seconds or so then closes out"

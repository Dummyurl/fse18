        "App was great to start with then would not send texts from SIM2. Helpline basically ignored me. I think they use bots rather than real people.  Sent my phone log 3 times. Resolved issue myself by deferring to phones own text option v Contacts+. Now looking for an alternative App.",
        "OMG I can't believe I haven't left a review for Contact+.. not only is the the best contact management system but I used it for years free & last year I finally got the paid app! I love it so much & how it works/merges Google contacts & Social Media.. downloading friends profile pic to so much more!! You won't regret trying & falling in love with Contact+.. trust me!",
        "Worlds Leading Contacts App!!!!???I I notice every complaint also seems to be answered by some kind've robot on reviews never so we can see always asking everyone shown to emails them! No solutions evident.... You can't even lock and save a message!? Can't get full size digits when numbers enlargened, can't find hang up button when in different screen! To many apps boast no trial on pro until you pay and regret!",

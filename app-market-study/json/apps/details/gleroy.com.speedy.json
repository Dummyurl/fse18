        "All feedback you need I love it! Works really well on my moto360 along with Nexus 5 and Strava. It helps me keep up the pace during my long runs. Could be easier to adjust the speed during running ex. in down- vs uphill long runs. Might also some more levels of vibrations with longer and shorter ones.",

        "It was working fine for a few weeks, then it asked me to log back in. I tried, but it wouldn't get past this. I checked and updated. Still got stuck at login. Unis tallied and reinstalled, still nothing. Tried everything several times, then emailed the developer from the info on this page, to get a reply saying the sensor isn't an official product please ring customer services. I'm now angry. Have possibly lost all previous data and can't see what I've got on the sensor and getting messed about with support! Really not acceptable for a company like Sony and a sensor costing so much money!",
        "No live video mode for me. Either using my tablet or my phone. If the usp for this item does not work, what is the point in spending the extra $$$ in this sensor. Without the live video mode, the sensor is as useful, but more expensive, as competitors ones",
        "I like this app alot, but why can't I save videos to sd card...most apps can!!!",
        "I did not like it at all they just wanted for you to buy something",
        "Not able to sign up an account!!!!!!!",
        "Two things to improve If you play twice in one day you can't save it as two separate sessions instead it just averages them. Very frustrating even if you download it separately, you won't be retrospectively able to see differences between the two sessions as they just become one. Also you should be able to program it to recognise your serve tell tail. As currently it always messes up smashes and serves."

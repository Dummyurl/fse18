        "Edit: worked great on the Urbane 2. Doesn't work on Sony SW3. I turn wifi on, but when I start the app, it doesn't detect wifi. Below is for the Urbane 2 review.  Best option to transfer music from phone to watch. Sadly. You would think you could at least do simple mtp transfers from your computer to your watch. It is 2017 after all. But no. This is quick and painless. I use ES file explore and just copy and paste. Worked like a charm.",
        "GREAT way to transfer music file to my moto360 specially for non USB connection android wear devices. good bye for google music play app.",
        "Exactly what I was looking for. Super simple and works fast and reliably. All other apps I have found are very slow transferring files and fail most of the time.",
        "Very cool app! Not the most elegant and fastest way to transfer files but works and seems reliable enough! This is the best Wear transfer app I found so far!",
        "Brilliant! Way faster than syncing large mp3 podcasts over Play Music, Sony Music or Wear Media (which I am using for playback). The ftp username/password is anonymous/guest.  To get wifi running on my Smartwatch 3, I disabled bluetooth on my phone and connected to a wifi in the watch settings menu.  Thanks a lot for creating this program! :)",
        "Doesn't work on Android Wear 2 devices. Please update the method and I will be happy to rate with 5* and even pay for the App. Thanks!!"

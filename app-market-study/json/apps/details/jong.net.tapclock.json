        "I like it but..... It's a well thought out idea and i like it.  But i feel prehaps you should be able to customize the vibrations on wear.  My email vibrates once and facebook is twice so I'm getting them confused.  Prehaps a more powerful vibration option as well for wear?  Its very good and helps keep track of time without constantly pulling out phone.  Well done",
        "the combination of my phone and lg watch r going off really keeps me aware of time!",
        "Works perfectly with my Moto360, keeps my from time traveling. Especially useful when I need to be focusing on work. Much more reliable than using the interval timers on the store for the same purpose. One bug: the bottom half of the configuration app slightly overlaps the top half (OnePlus One with CyanogenMod 12, with on-screen nav bar enabled. if on screen nav is disabled or hidden its fine)."

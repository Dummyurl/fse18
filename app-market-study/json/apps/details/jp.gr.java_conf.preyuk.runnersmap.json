        "Good job But,the use was not clear to me,after installation, l could not see my location.",
        "Great ideea. Seems like a nice tool to track my workouts.. but the UI needs more polishing",
        "Great I love  it, useful  for me",
        "Really interesting app for those, who want to have some statistics about their running-/riding-workout. Unfortunately it is missing intructions, which would make it much easier to get started with this app"

        "Fantastic app Great and simile interface to keep track of income, spending and budgets. I've used this on a daily basis and find it very easy to use. Only issue being I get paid mid month and the app appears restart your spending based on a calendar month. There may be a way to adjust this but I've not located yet. Still a great app.",
        "Widget does not update Love the fact that it works with my android wear but the widget on the phone does not update immediately after I keyed in a new expense. Please fix. Thanks.",
        "(+) Partners module allowing to share the same budget between users. (-) Monthly subscription.",
        "Great potential but has an issue Good app, potentially could go mainstream but you need to stop it from asking me to donate. You should use well placed adverts if you need to raise money it's more effective and won't get in the way as much.",
        "Liked it at one time Just updated app and it won't let me use it unless i link it to my google account and allow it to tell people when I'm logged into it.... thats no one else's buisness regardless if they are friends and family or not... uninstalling and never coming back",
        "Love it.  Issues: Schedule operation screen clears description field if you click some of the other fields like the date or category. \"POWTARZANIE\" (??) needs to be translated to English. Need a way to delete categories, if possible."

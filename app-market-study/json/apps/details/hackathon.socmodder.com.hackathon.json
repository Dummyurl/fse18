        "Life Saver Just saved me hours of hunting for my parking spot in a crowded city with poor reception. This app proudly carried the baton where others had failed. Why should you need data connectivity to store a simple gps coordinate? You don't, that's stupid. Simply brilliant.",
        "Battery killer",
        "Very useful",
        "Wonderful But it worked on my mobile for first time. Note it's not working",
        "Very convenient! Nice Job!",
        "Very cool! This app is a must have for anyone with an Android Wear device.  I love how simple it is to note places from my Moto 360.  Excited to see what they add next!"

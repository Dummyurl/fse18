        "As with Arun' s experience (2.1.2018) the purchased version reverted to the free version - especially annoying as it was obtained for using xl version of excel. Lot of work lost here! Very disappointing. Have no screen shots to offer - cannot resurrect what has disappeared! Shall contact you separately for another download via Google play store. Look forward to your immediate response.",
        "Caveat emptor! Paid the full $14.99 to these rip-off artists and they refused to give me an activation code for my new phone. Program was only ever on my old phone. Tried to tell me I exceeded the activation requests. Bullcrap. They don't even answer emails anymore.",
        "This app is disfunctional. It stops working correctly. You try and update to correct it's problems, then I wants you to purchase the app again... Very frustrated..",
        "Premium app became free with ads automatically. What happened team? No intimations. Make it back to premium version.  Dear team,   What happened to my purchased pro version? It came along with my phone. I am using only one Gmail account to login.   Thanks, Arun.",
        "It is loaded with ads and very slow. Wth. Is this how the pro version will be? I'm not going to buy it",
        "This is great for me, many devices, a dislike of Microsoft and works fully on my Samsung S8 with DeX and all the trimmings"

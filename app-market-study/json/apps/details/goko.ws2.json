        "\"see all compatible apps\"? \"Be up-to-date\"? With this app? It hasn't been updated since last year! How could I be up-to-date if you never update your app and don't list the newest Wear apps in it? Android Wear 2.0 was just released a few weeks ago and it's the biggest hit, but you never took the time for making an update for the latest 2.0 apps that are appearing every single day. Your last Google+ post for Wear apps was made about 10 weeks ago. If you offer a paid service, you should take it much more seriously than this."

        "Seems to work well, and is accurate enough for my needs. I was bummed to find out that all stats aren't saved for review after ending trip. All you're able to see after ending is a map view. Stats such as time, average speed, and maximum speed are lost as soon as you tap \"end trip\". If you're interested in saving those be sure to write them down someplace before you end. If saving those can be implemented somehow I would likely raise to 5 stars.",
        "Not very useful. I can find the trip stats after the trip is finished other than the map. Also I just came home from the store and the app said I maxed out my speed at 581.9mph no wonder people were flipping me off.",
        "Pretty good So far its accurate but I was really hoping it would give me a log of the miles I traveled.",
        "No support option Tried playing music thru headphones the same time running trip tracker, turn off tracker, music works fine.",
        "Why everyone have this Buy it",
        "It does what it says I can now change my review :) this app works fantastically, it starts and stops it's self and uses a proper card notification rather than an open app. App has good support on the development side and is updated well."

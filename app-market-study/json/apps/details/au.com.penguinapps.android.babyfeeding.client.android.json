        "Certain features are only free for 20-30 days. Then the app takes away those features. I've never heard of an app do that. Kind of shady on the developers part. Otherwise, App is easy to use and very user friendly. So much better than writing everything down. Just wish I would've known about this sooner. Unfortunately, the app stopped letting me and my wife sync and required upgrade to even look at timeline or summary. It was great for 2 weeks and then just kind of cut us off.",
        "I love this app and have used it with all my kids. From birth it was extremely helpful with keeping track of feedings and diapers. Now that my youngest are 2 and 4 I use it most to track medication, temperature and sickness. This app is wonderful and I'm so happy I purchased it 4 years ago. It has been well worth the money I spent. Not to mention there have been updates added throughout the years that make this app even better. Very user friendly. I used/use this alot when taking my kids to the doctor as it literally has everything the Dr wants to know on it. Highly recommended from this mother of 5!!",
        "If I could give this app more stars I would! We just had our first child and since our brains are utter mush with excitement and love for our newborn, we are lucky to get both shoes on the right feet, let alone chart bathroom stuff and which boob is getting more attention from our new baby. This app makes it all very easy. I can't imagine doing this without this app!",
        "I love this app! I ended up buying it to upgrade free version and it was worth every penny. I use it daily to track feeds (including solids), diaper changes, baths, temperature, meds, shots & doc visit weight & length. My baby is going on 8 months & I couldn't function without it especially at the beginning when I was sleep deprived & couldn't remember a thing. Best baby app in my opinion",
        "Very complete. Only issue is sometimes the sync does not seem to always be in immediate real time. I have Android, wife has IOS and we both had to pay $5 each for the priveledge if auto sync and yet it's not 100%. Also even after paying for \"premium\" they force you to write a review to remove that request that is plastered on the screen. Really their items should reduce to 3 stars but the app itself is very well done, thorough and intuitive.",
        "Suffices for everything it claims to do. Easy to use, making it helpful to keeping on track, therefore serving it's sought out purpose. Would suggest adding some options to be more detailed in the diaper logs, with the chances of it being a topic mentioned at least once between a parent and their pediatrician. Also another great convenience would ultimately be the option to add and customize your own tasks or journals while having the ability to edit and priorities with existing ones alike. I really like this app and I plan to stick with it. Unless of course, one comes along just like this one but with those features included ;) Thanks for the app as is, I must say. Makes my head hurt less than trying to keep track of everything by memory."

        "Great simple calendar app for Android Wear and a very responsive developer! He responded to my feature request same day and it was implemented shortly after.",
        "I like this app a lot,  it's simple yet very useful. I have one small question though: given that I live in the Netherlands could you perhaps add our national holidays to the holiday options? Thanks a lot",
        "Doesn't display my calendar events. The design is really nice and if it worked, I would use this app.",
        "This app really helps simplify date checking for me on my wrist (and many others I believe) Developer answered my request to add my country in a swift and professional manner... Very impressive. Thanks very much and i encourage all to give this app a try.",

        "Very clean lines. The C and CE functions are in the \"clr\" button which is sometimes \"del\". Memory function took me a while to work out but is accessed by a long press on the result of a calculation. It would benefit from a detailed set of functions so people can find these out easily. I much prefer this to the stock calculator on my s8.",
        "It's great now, smooth UI with history and memory recall and m+ and m- functions integrated in the touch based UI rather than buttons. Very intuitive to use. Amazing really, hadn't used this app from Google for a long time. Only thing missing is unit conversion and currency calculator.",
        "No C or CE button? Tried the help from the menu, nothing. I realize there seems to be this huge trend of making everything very neat and clean and simple, but fundamental functions need to be on things. I don't appreciate having to guess where things are hidden. We used to have menus for a reason. Put the menus back.",
        "Really enjoy this calculator because it's fast and easy to use. The only thing it's missing is a clear all button. If you have an equation you're typing in and want to clear the whole thing (before hitting enter) you have to delete every single number one by one and it makes it sorta time consuming. Maybe I'm just overlooking this? I would love that too be the case because I enjoy the app, but it's just missing that one button.",
        "Well i wanted to multiply by 1.03 for a percentage increase year after year but i need to enter that amount every time you can't hit the enter button over and over.  Pointless app",
        "Error After Nougat update, my Calculator disappeared from my Apps list, now I can't install it. Any way to fix this (without resetting, I can't reset my phone, too important sms are in it)"

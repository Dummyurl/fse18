        "Doesn't seem to work Really like the idea but when I mimic the code it just vibrates continuously in random patterns then shows a cross and the app closes, had potential.",
        "I've really wanted to learn Morse code! And now with this app on my watch I just might be able to do so!",
        "Simple The app has a simple interface and is very easy to use! Great job!",
        "Awesome Perfect App!",
        "Almost Great, but utter fail Every time I look at a letter I get a vibration. I don't want that and can't turn it off. It'd be nice if there was a 'show me' area that would do the vibration, and a 'try me' area where you could practice them."

        "Great app, wherever you can find parking it is great. Only problem is that they need to be in communication with the parking garages, more than once I've had to get a ticket and then meddle with people because there not there to scan your QR code",
        "Fail. Might work if there's a scanner at the garage, but some garages require you to contact attendant for exit. No attendant answered, so I had to pay to open the gate and my fee paid through the app was wasted.",
        "Love this app, saves me time and money in the big apple.  Finding street parking in NYC is horrible, this app finds nearby parking garages for the price that's fair.  I recommend this app to friends and family.",
        "What a great app!!! Saves me tons of money because parking in DC is expensive!",
        "Awesome app. Blows spot hero out of the water. Excellent..use it all the time in the city of Chicago.",
        "Charged 13 dollars over the rate at the garage.  Ripoff!"

        "Verizon does what it says, most of the time. Meaning the app! Works great! Awesome tech support! üòÑ But not the chat. It pops up when I barely touch to get into the app. Verizon Is my Top choice for products They offer. I don't see the options I once Seen IN the app cuz Then I have to go Really online in my browser, I think. Overall Verizon is The Best 4G etc., etc. Etc, for many of my needs. I can't get to Repair like I used to either at my Odd hours ~",
        "The new \"card\" layout is very bad. So much wasted space and very ugly. This is not a news app. It also seems fingerprint login is not an option anymore. I would be impressed if Verizon had the foresight to realize this is wrong and just scrap the new design. Consider it a mistake learned from.",
        "Terrible redesign. Used to look like a great Android app. Now I don't even know what design it's going for. Go back to the drawing board, Verizon. This is abysmal.",
        "This app used to work great for bill paying....but for the last several months I get an error saying \"oops something went wrong\" and i can't even open the app. Several calls to customer service, was told they would call me back as it was something on their end on my account...still no resolution and never heard back from them. Wish I could just uninstall it.",
        "New app design is not visually appealing. Very generic and \"cheap\" looking. It's slower also. Other design was more user friendly. Don't like that i have to keep logging in. Revert back!",
        "Went from 5 stars to 1. Who designed the UI? A 14 year old? It's bland, cannot dismiss cards, and reminds me every time I open the app that yes I know I canceled my order. I hate to say it but T-mobile's UI is better at this time."

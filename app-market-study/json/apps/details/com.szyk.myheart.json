        "Although this app deserves more than a 5 star rating, the export data for the PDF doesnt seem to work. When selected, it just sits there and loads. Otherwise, i love it!",
        "Brilliant app, must  goto and must have if you serious about keeping track of bp. You can generate comprehensive reports in pdf that you can share with your Doctor.It is multi user too. It was instrumental in proving my case that my son needed for treatment for his wildly fluctuating bp.",
        "Love it except for the ads that pop up when looking at the previous readings.  Irritating but it's free so can't complain too much.",
        "Used to use another app but this  one is fantastic. So far zero cons. Would recommend to anyone, only reason for not full marks is, you never know if you might find a better app (however unlikely this may seem) I love the export options. Would be fantastic if there was an idiot proof way of porting the App TOGETHER WITH ALL EXISTING DATA to a NEW or Second device, even better a \"Merge Data\"  option in case several devices are used in different situations (say tablet at work, phone everywhere else), I would imagine this may be a feature in a paid for version.",
        "I use this app every day. It's been helpful when I've needed to show my doctor, my progress. This easy to use app. has all the basses covered when you need a quick and easy to use and with complete stat record",
        "I have used other apps but this one is hands down the best and most functional app I have used. I particularly like the ability to export the data to my physician. The app is also very easy to use . You don't have to be tech savy in order to work with it."

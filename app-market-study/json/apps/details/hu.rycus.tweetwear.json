        "Great but... Is showing me tweets at least twice an hour with refresh set at every three? What am I missing? Great app. Asus zenwatch 2 with Samsung 6 marshmallow here. Edited: it settled down nicely. Terrific support. Love it.",
        "Very Good This is App is very good, the only thing missing is the multiple twitter account option. Or am I missing something?",
        "Great Does just what I was looking for. Tweets quick. Would like option to disable retrieving of tweets altogether though. I don't care to read tweets on my watch. Downloaded specifically to tweet from it.",
        "This. Thank you for this. Thank you.",
        "Awesome Perfect app, thanks for adding the vibration option!",
        "Works very well Would it be possible to only send tweets from specific people to the Wear device? I follow a lot of people / companies but I don't necessarily want to see their tweets. If There was a list on the Phone where I could check or uncheck the people I wanted to send to the watch it would be perfect for me!"

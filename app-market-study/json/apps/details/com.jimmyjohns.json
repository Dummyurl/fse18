        "5 *s! Addicted to Jimmy John's and the app supports my lack of social skills and the anxiety that goes along with having to call the store... I mean.. what if a girl takes my order and she sounds cute?! I'll blow it.. Nightmare",
        "Editing delivery instructions or tip resets the other fields.  Drivers arrive and tip isn't included.  Should have a confirmation step or something to ensure accuracy.  Load this on your phone and test it.  You can't see needed info when your keyboard is up and don't know it has reset.",
        "This is a simple app to use, and I love it! I am having one issue with it, however. When I check out and submit the order the notes for the order are deleted. I have to call into Jimmy John's after every order I make to update the note",
        "Used it 1 time and it won't let me order any more. It says my password is wrong and it won't let me change it. I  tried 5 times.",
        "App is requesting an update when i try to open it, when I click update App it brings me to Google Play where there is no update to be found. Until it updates, it can't even be used. I uninstalled it & reinstalled hoping that would help, but ran into the same issue.",
        "Used a couple of times with no issues, then suddenly my default address does not have a location near by. Ordered online with no problem. Just a weird glitch that caused me to delete the app."

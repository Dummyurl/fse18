        "Very prettyâ€¦ not so useful I tried this app after FocusGTD that does the same kind of thing for a lower price. This app looks much better, but lacks basic functionality, and has terrible problems: IT DELETES ALL NOTES AND REPEATED TASKS!",
        "REPEATING TASKS GETS WIPED OUT Update:  Also Sub Actions do not appear...  Update:  It's been 2 months without any updates....  Update:  There has been some updates, will change from at least it warns about repeating tasks...1 star to 2 star...please implement access to notes too. Update: looks like he abandoned this app",
        "Pros:  The developer Steve is very accessible and helped me out when I had some trouble setting it up.   No major syncing issues helping me stay OmniFocused when away from my computer.   Cons: Still has more features it needs to add. Missing the ability to set custom due dates and custom repeating options. Also I would really love there to be a calendar view option.    10/ 24/ 2016 UPDATED:   Now Steve won't respond to emails. It completely won't work and he won't get back to me so it's wasted money. DON'T BUY.",
        "I've been a dedicated Omnifocus user for years now, and recently jumped the iOS ship. Steven got back to me very quickly about my questions and suggestions - which is quite impressive! As a new application, it needs some work (which he is obviously doing!) but is still quite usable - I think it is fair to say that this is an investment in a good app that has the promise of being a great app. As long as we don't have to pay another $12.99 for the next version, it is money well spent! Update: This app kept promising but never came through. The developer promised to make all sorts of improvements and its still barely functional with basic things like repeating tasks. I'm so tired of this app I never use it anymore.",
        "Great Client missing a couple things I think this is the best omnifocus client for android. However, it seems like it was never finished. The main feature I would like to see fixed is the ability to check off repeating tasks, which is strangly lacking :(",
        "Stuck in setup loop After login into my Omnisync account I get the synchronising screen which completes the process but when I click 'finish setup' it goes back to synchronising. I can't get passed this and even see my tasks."

        "No save function, keys are buggy The notes can't be saved, unless you take out the phone and make a smart watch screenshot, but at that point you could just doodle on your phone. The notes can't be saved nor sent to anyone. You only have 3 buttons: the rubber (undo), a bin (clear all)  and an X that should exit the app. Too bad those 3 buttons only work maybe 1 time out of 5. This app is pointless.",

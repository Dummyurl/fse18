        "Used to LOVE this app - have listened to radio for years via this app. Haven't minded the ads - but now the Spanish language Disney commercial plays over & over!  I know I'm in San Diego, but I can neither afford 2K for a 4-day Disney trip nor comprende EspanolÂ¡  Know your audience iHeart.  I'm a loyal listener to KFI - but less so to apps that don't \"learn\" about daily users.",
        "Fine, except for the constant \"You've been selected by IHeart for a free 30 day trial\" why do I keep getting selected?  I'm never that lucky in other drawings / lottery /slots. IHeart -  go ahead and give someone else a chance -  you don't have to keep congratulating me and selecting me.",
        "Could be a lot better needs a lot of work. For one I can't get any BBC radio stations like I am able to on most other similar apps.  1.Buffer time 2. direct station input 3. better search engine 4. player controls 5. Shoutcast search 6. Less intrusive advertising. (Video taking over is ridiculous)",
        "Regularly repeating songs, ever since the update. Not really complaining, since my stations are full of favorites.  My local radio station is on here, but plays half the songs, then repeats them...because we won't notice our favorite riffs are missing...",
        "I really like it, but the ads can get frequent from time to time which can be sorta sickening sometimes. However; premium is relatively cheap and you get rid of ads plus you can use other features which are really nice to have. Overall I really like this app! I would definitely recommend this app to my friends! ðŸ˜Š",
        "Worst app! After fifteen minutes of trying to get the radio station, and getting no where, I deleted and got another app that works just fine. I gave it five stars."

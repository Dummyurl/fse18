        "No Pause The dev is obviously going for minimalism here, no tracking and memory of any kind. That would suit certain people fine, I'm sure. But no pause function? That's not practical.",
        "I like it. But.. Simple and no frills. But I wish you added option to get a break on a button. I don't always use 3 for long break ratio. I have to check time myself.",
        "Rotten How can something so simple cause so many problems? Installed and started the app, created an endless loop of phone and wear crashes to the point I had to reset my devices.",
        "Great app No settings, no noise. Simple and clear! Found it  in stackoverflow question. Please make apk size smaller. 6mb for what?",
        "Like it Interface is so clean, no ads, good material design. I think the only missing part is that sometimes I do not hear the break time notification.",
        "Bug The timer counts down 25min but shows it beginning from 55min. And Even the breaks 5min appears as 35min"

        "Had an issue, complained, then fixed by developer. Great app",
        "Whenever I try to use Task now from Google assistant it says  - Task Now isn't supported in this region. I am already subscribed. Couldn't use for a single time. Please help.  Yes. It's English.",
        "Is it possible to get it working even when phone is lock ot in sleeping mode?",
        "Does exactly as described with great support. (just like all the apps from this developer)",
        "Needs an action to trigger a voice recognition process on the watch, isolated to just that task. Basically I'm trying to make a parrot to mess with people",
        "It was my go-to before author got greedy.  Now he wants me to pay again every month for functionality I already paid for.  Never.  Use Autovoice, use Shortcuts to avoid extra verbage.  It is faster and more customizable anyways.  I was already having to use shortcuts with Tasker Now to shut up google before Tasker Now dismissed it anyways.  Edit: Pixel XL here, so for us Google Now is not an option, Google Assistant or nothing.  Considering I paid for the functionality to work with Google Assistant once, months ago, why would I pay it again every month after it was disabled in what I already pay for, when I can use a competing utility I already own?  Suit yourselves but I'm not buying into the subscription model for this or any other app.  And I'm a developer, so I understand the economics of it.  Edit: fair enough, a refund would be fine"

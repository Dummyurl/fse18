        "Why do you need detailed personal information such as my addresss? Too invasive of a innocuous device. Convenience only gets you so much access.",
        "Pretty useless compared to the first generation.  They are pretty much trying to force you into a subscription service.  You should at least have the same functionality in your phone and you do with the online login.  You have zero control over your thermostats schedule from your phone , unless you get premium.",

        "Better then stock... but not great It'll do splits so you can see multiple individual times, BUT it doesn't show the cumulative time.  For instance if you are doing a workout with timed segments you'll only get each segment time, not the total :(",
        "Pretty good Nice interface - big easy to press buttons for lap times.  If this showed the cumulative time and lap # on the main screen (can't find cumulative time anywhere), then this would be a 5-star app.",
        "Not bad! Keeps the screen on, which devours battery over a long session. Needs an update to follow the device's screen behavior.",
        "Good, but missing a few features. First of all, it doesn't count the last lap (when you hit stop instead of lap) as the fastest lap, even if it was the fastest. Second, I want it to show me the total time, not just the individual laps. Third, a dim screen would help save battery life. Other than that, it works.",
        "Dissapointing Good chunky main display and vibration, but no pause and no background-running.",
        "Like it! Would be awesome if it had cumulative time for split timing & export times feature / history"

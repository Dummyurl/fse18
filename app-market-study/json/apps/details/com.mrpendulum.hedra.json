        "Great Start - Here's some feedback I found this app through reddit. I searched Google Play for 'wear d20' and 'wear dice' and this never showed up in the results. Definitely try to figure out what's causing that because I figure this would have way more downloads if people could find it easier. Also, please add support for Android Wear 5.1's always on feature so I don't have to keep relaunching the app every time my watch screen times out. It also crashes every now and then on my Moto 360 running 5.1. Also please add an option to tap to roll",
        "Great App Hedra is the only Wear Compatible Polyhedral Dice App on the market. Definitely worth the premium, and then some. I would buy this app 5 times just to support the developer/s. You guys are on point. I don't use the tactile response, but love that it's an option. Keep up the good work!",
        "Very cool, and worth the money! Well Done! This is exactly what I was looking for. Super good looking on the 360. I love the marble look to the die, but could you add more colors please? I'm would love a deep green!",
        "Good-looking and functional Initially, it wouldn't work at all, but reinstalling seems to have fixed this.",
        "Perfect. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Proof that we are, indeed, living in the future."

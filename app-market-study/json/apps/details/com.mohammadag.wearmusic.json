        "Reluctant at first I was a little nervous at first with 1 review and just a couple downloada for 2.50 but i went for it.  Omg its easy to use and sync. Works very well and happy I decided to download this.   Dont know if ill ever use my watch to listen to music but its nice to have :)  great work/app. Highly recommend.  One small request would be to add a random feature for songs :)",
        "Note 4 and LG Urbane Not a good app. for the price we pay. I'm not able to transfer the music except one. The rest of the music are just in process for hours. I think someone else had the same issue. He had Note 4 & Sony sm3. Is it android wear 5.1 or is this a poorly made application? Looks like the developer is fast to get cash but not working properly. Uninstalled then reinstalled but still the same issue moreover the previously downloaded music duplicates.",
        "Not going to good so far. Please could you tell me how to sync music to my watch. Have selected 2 tracks to copy but it just hangs with the two bars flashing to say they are copying but nothing happens have selected getup tracks but they have been hanging all morning. Please help as would love to get this working. I am using a galaxy s7 with a huawei watch 2",
        "Doesn't work It only allows me to sync ringtones to my watch, even though I have all of my music downloaded to my phone. Totally worthless.",
        "Awesome app Any way I could have voice command play music to play from this app instead? Thank you. The only things keeping this app from perfect is a need for a delete button(coz doesnt really sync well, i had to clear data the app), and a shuffle button",
        "Works great! What was Google thinking when they wrote the spec for Play Music on the Wear device? Play Music does let you play music standalone from the watch... BUT only if you have a subscription and only for music you downloaded from Google Play. This app lets me select MP3s from my own collection."

        "Actually works Been trying to find something that actually works to control PowerPoint from my Android Wear - this does it. There's a companion app for the PC that displays your IP and Port, type the IP in on the phone and away you go. I have not been able to get the gestures to work, but based on the video,  don't think I'd use them anyway because it'd be too awkward.",
        "Worked great, then stopped Using Moto360 and downloaded a month or so ago. Worked great initially. When I tried using it last week no dice. Watch works, phone works, air ppt does not. Requesting refund or support to fix.",
        "Partially works now, great potential for later I bought this app after a recommendation on Android Police. I would give this app 3.5 stars because the app is in an early development and not everything is optimized. I use a Moto 360 and a Windows 8.1 laptop. What it can do is control the flow of slides from a phone or a Wear watch touch screen. The Wear app (Moto 360 particular) is cropped off from the bottom and I could not successfully  use any gestures. The Windows app is not optimized for high DPI like an ultrabook. Once these things are fixed, this app will well be worth $2.73 for anybody who needs to control a PowerPoint. Plus, it will look super cool.  I think this app, if it can integrate into PowerPoint, should display notes  or be able to control the laser pointer mouse cursor.",

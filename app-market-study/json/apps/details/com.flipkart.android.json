        "All and all I am happy with the flipkart and the experience till the time is really satisfactory.  1) The presentation of the product is good either it's through the images uploaded on the site or the description for the product. 2) the team is really working on the feedbacks and from time to time they will come up with something new like flipkart pay later option is quite cool as of now.  Keep the good work going üëçüëç",
        "flipkart app truly gives an awesome shopping experience.. however,i think flipkart should work on its business model where shipping cost is often seemingly unjustified.. it's better if listing includes shipping cost so that i can sort products according to the final all inclusive cost that i pay for",
        "Not good Doesn't provide Cod on latest phone. And do auto cancellation. We are not fools that we will do online payment for the product that is going to be cancelled within seconds or after shipment. Worst online shopping site",
        "Worst ever experience of flash sale.. they canceled my orders about 3-4 times. They are just playing with our feeling. I want to gift it to my mother on her birthday and these stupid things are happening.   No COD on Redmi Note 5 pro.....! are you jocking....? What do you want...? Should I pay an amount of about 14000 and if there is any problem in that product, will you return that amount as fast as we paid...? Well I don't think so... Why should I give you my whole salary of a month for 2 days... Are you..",
        "Very bad customer service. I didn't sign in from 18th Feb in Flipkart account.  And from that date I contacted with customer care continuously via call or mail also but the issue is not resolved yet.  They repeat again and again \"sir wait for 24 hours or 72 hours our back-end team will contact you and sent an email to you.  But till today I didn't receive any mail or call from Flipkart team.",
        "I'm rating down this due to cancellation of orders even after shipping.   When speaking to the customer care, we receive a response to made a new order of the same item..ooohmy..G... what on earth..! Everyone knew the difficulty of booking flash sales..and not every sales include bank offers and cash backs..  Dear flipkart...you really need to review this types of problems.  THIS IS A BIG LOST OF MONEY AND TIME for regular customers like us"

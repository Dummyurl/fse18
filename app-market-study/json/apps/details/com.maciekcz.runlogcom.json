        "The timer stopped working suddenly and distance tracking is not accurate",
        "Please add top speed feature per lap or per activity,it will be lot helpful",
        "Great simple app.   Can you allow the smartwatch app to display miles per hour instead of only km/h?  Thanks!",
        "Simple,  straight to the point, easy to use, and it's definitely accurate. It's also very easy to modify setting such as switching from km to miles."

        "Does what it says This app will let you talk to your Sonos. It's not exactly what I was hoping for but it does work. It will allow you to start playlists, and also turn the sound on and off. In order to be voice activated the app needs to be running. So it doesn't really turn on the way the way that \"OK Google\" does. You can't say play Sirius channel 100, but you can say play a playlist."

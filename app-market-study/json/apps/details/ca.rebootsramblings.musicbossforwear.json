        "Album art not showing up, tried on Google Play Music, Spotify & Apple Music",
        "Incredibly inconsistent. The app opens on its own when it wants to. The swipe feature is why I bought this, but if I still have to look at the watch to see if my swipes are working, it defeats the purpose. For 3 dollars, at least make a product that works.",
        "Excellent, high quality app. First and most important it works with all the players I tried - Media Monkey, Player Pro, Pandora and Spotify. It's fully configurable. I really like how the controls are implemented. The embedded tutorial (!) really helps, use it and you will love the app. Good job guys, congrats!",
        "This app does not find any music in my device, I have 2 downloaded albums on my moto 360 sport and it does not show anything. Not even has an option to search for music. This is a rip off."

        "Works well, needs small fix Works well for me (G Watch R). Only thing a bit annoying is that the notifications keep on displaying o  the watch even if tower on the phone is not active. Would be great to have this suppressed when Tower is not running on the phone.",
        "App is not working with my LG Urbane 2 with a Samsung Note 4. My watch says the app is installed, but there is no option to launch it anywhere. The companion on the phone seems to work. Please fix this.",
        "Constantly notifying Great app but always on my watch even when not running on my phone. Lg g watch r",
        "Can you change it from meters per second to MPH on Tower?",

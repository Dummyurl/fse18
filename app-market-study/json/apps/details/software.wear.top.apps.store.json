        "I just installed it to comment on this. I saw where the dev responded to someone's one star rating asking them to review the app again. Here is my middle finger. --NO! We will not review this again if we thought it was pointless! Please go reevaluate your app, you amoeba.",
        "Pointless Useless app, here is why: all of the apps on it aren't even all for Android wear. It's easier to search on google play, which is where everyone found this app. Logic would dictate that this app is useless. There isn't anything on there that is exclusive or even new, just a poor attempt at a \"store\"  in my opinion.",
        "Unstable product These apps attached to this program is broken.  It doesn't know what it wants to do. I am highly considering returning to Samsung's  Tizen. I feel like I've  wasted my money. I really wanted to believe in android wear.",
        "Do you honestly think that telling someone to review your app again is smart. Wrong, it makes you look desperate for a good rating. Maybe you could listen to your audience instead of sitting on your ass trying to make the best of a bad situation. Lets not forget that these apps arent even exclusive to android wear so they are barely compatible. This app needs serious work.",
        "Good collection of apps, though lists are a little stuttery on my Note 3. I know it's not the newest of devices, but other apps still perform much smoother.    I think it would be useful to have a section devoted to launcher apps, with of course Wear Mini Launcher and Bubble Cloud Launcher on the top but there are a lot of other choices too. I think these -- like launchers on the phone -- will stay to be relevant even if the platform now offers a barebones functionality in AWv5.1.1.",
        "Current samsung wear live Working well so far. Was easier to find apps for Samsung S2 Neo but I really like android wear better. Just more difficult to find apps but after figuring things out has so much more power in Wear."

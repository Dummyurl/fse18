        "Simple, good, yet one flaw I can't get over the incorrect naming used: storage is incorrectly named \"memory\" in this app. Memory and RAM are the same thing. Storage is something else entirely. The first tab needs to be named \"storage\".",
        "Very good This app could be much better. The CPU updates are a bit slow and the graphics seem childish, otherwise minimalistic and great. I like the icon.",
        "Hmm, opened it once, crashed, then stated not installed. Rebooted & hoping for the best... Didn't really work for me...",
        "Does exactly what it says! Clean interface, useful app. A very good addition to my LG G Watch Urbane.",
        "Too simplistic and little useful information displayed.",

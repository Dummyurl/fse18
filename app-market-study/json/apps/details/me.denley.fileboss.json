        "The file explorer for the watch works fully but you cannot copy files from phone to watch. It just hangs. You can view files on phone, just can't copy them over or open them from the phone. Last update was from 2015 so that's probably why.",
        "Doesnt Work Can't seem to copy files. I can only view file list and sometimes that doesn't work either. Would be great if it actually worked.",
        "Decent Works as advertised. Crashes if you try to view a folder besides the internal storage.",
        "Good file manager, needs rename function I like this app for its simple interface, it can move, delete, copy, view files. But it can't rename files. Would love this as a feature.",
        "For wear to wear file operations in Android Wear 2 (the main reason for me to be interested in file browsers on watches lol), everything works great, so long as the file directory starts with \"/sdcard/\". For any watch to phone or phone to watch file operations, NOTHING WORKS...",
        "Functional, but limited You can explore directories, but only the \"storage/emulated/0\" directory. You cannot explore the root directory, which is what I need to do."

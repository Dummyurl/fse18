Save messages for re-reading later or pause to continue reading later.- Stored notifications playback is detected only when user returns to the Home screen.- Simplified user interface makes the application intuitive and working in the background.- Simplified way of adding applications by detecting and asking user on demand, as and when application notifications are detected. No more fiddling in the Settings to manually add application.- Works with Android Wear since the application controls are done through the notification tray.DEVICE TESTED:- Works with Nexus 5, Nexus 7 2013  and Sony Z- LG G WatchNOTES:- Automatically dismiss notifications when they are recorded.- There are certain limitations to some applications notifications where the message is not included in the notification. For such applications, only the title is read. Empty messages are not read out to the user (e.g. Skype).FREE VERSION:- Restricted to maximum 10 applications for reading. Just to show that it works.PERMISSIONS:Below are default minimum permissions required by the Tasker App Factory application.- DISABLE KEYGUARD- WAKE_LOCK- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETEDFROM THE DEVELOPER:- This a hobby project using Tasker which has been extended to be a full application.- Several use cases were tested to ensure that the application works seamlessly without surprising message playback especially in public places and the user initiated playback was preferred for this reason.- It took some time to get the application to be where it is using the environment of Tasker and Tasker App Factory. - The intention was not really to do a full-on Android application with all the bells and whistles but to use an existing automation environment and add the intelligence in the background.- Great work from Tasker and Tasker App Factory team for allowing this capability to develop an automation app directly on the phone/tablet device, test it and release it as an APK for others to use.- If you think the application deserves it then buying the FULL VERSION will be highly appreciated, otherwise a positive comment is a nice pat in the back already.",

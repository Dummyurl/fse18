        "The wear graph is great. I was able to use it to prove to a watch face/app designer that their app caused battery drain. Now that I have two android wear watches though I need to request that multi-watch support would be appreciated. Many thanks.",
        "Wear battery graph sold it to me It's not perfect, I had to install it twice before it showed up in my launcher. But now I can monitor BOTH phone and watch batteries easily. I've not tried the CSV export yet, so I can't comment.",
        "Perfect for Android wear I wanted a widget capable of displaying battery info from my watch. This does the job quite well.",
        "I have used this for a while. It is OK, but it show 1000 times less current. Normally it show -0.1 to -0.5 mA. It should be A.",
        "Needed a widget to quickly check my Wear battery level while I'm not wearing it around the house. This fits the bill perfectly.",
        "Excellent little battery monitor widget"

    "recentChanges": [

        "1.4.0 - Added a \"smooth\" option to the temperature and current graphs, to smooth out the bumps.",
        "1.3.0 - Added the ability to define multiple independent widgets, each of different sizes, with different graphs and so on.",
        "- On Android Lollipop devices, can now monitor instantaneous current (in milliamperes) and battery energy level (in milliwatt hours)."

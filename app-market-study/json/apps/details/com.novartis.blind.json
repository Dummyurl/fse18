    "description": "The aim of this app is to allow a blind/low vision person to move independently thanks to the ability to walk to a destination starting from their position and have information useful to facilitate their orientation while moving. This information is provided and adapted taking into consideration the peculiar needs of a blind/low vision pedestrian and the app user interface is simple and easy to use.The user can enter a destination and get the turn by turn directions from their current position to that destination. Way-points can be added to improve the effectiveness of the calculated route.While moving the app will also give information on next junctions as well as distances and directions.At any time the user can query the app for their position and get it in terms of street address. A list of junctions around the user, with the corresponding distances and bearings, can also be obtained.Information relevant to the user mobility are provided by using the Text To Speech (even if no screen-reader is running).This app may run in background mode and use the location service, in case the navigation to a point is set. The use of background GPS may draw heavily on your device battery. Use this feature only as needed.",

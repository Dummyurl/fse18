        "No windows app - No points!  Why do you not make this app for Windows 10? Over 700 million people use windows 10 now, surely that must be enough users to motivate to make an app!  Even if only a Web-app in a wrapper! I will give you proper scoring when I find your app in the Microsoft Store.",
        "Aika hidas sovellus mutta silti toimiva olisi mukava jos sovelluksen ja widgettien teeman voisi vaihtaa tummempaan",
        "Mega dårlig udviklet app. Virker som noget rigtigt hjemmebikset amatør app-makværk. Kan ikke anbefales til nogen.",
        "Doesn't work on my phone anymore now that i have changed to new phone Huawei Mate 10 pro.",
        "Appen är väldigt väldigt seg, framförallt vid uppstart.  Bildtagning tar mycket lång tid  Det borde finnas Panik/Larm knapp i appen."

        "Cool app I like that it runs entirely in the background with no ongoing notifications. Would be nice if you added the feature to start the watch's recording from the phone. Also I think maybe changing the name from \"NightMic for Wear\" to \"Night Mic for Wear\" with the space might improve store search results.  Keep up the good work!",

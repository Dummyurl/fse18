        "I've been using the paid version of this app since 2013 and have honestly loved it until recently. Features have been disappearing as of late behind a $50/year paywall. The old design was better and wasn't chalk full of adverts peddling users to pay more. The app worked great before. Why ruin something good? Time to look elsewhere",
        "Paid for this app ages ago. It worked just geat. Then a year or so later adverts started appearing.  Pretty sure the point of paying then was to get rid of ads. Then developer starts taking more and more functionality away saying I have to pay more.  That wasn't the deal. So essentially it's theft.  Next you know they'll be wanting your house. Would be a good app otherwise, if it worked how it used to and what I paid for. In short.  Avoid.",
        "I have been noticing lately that the app has been stopping in the middle of my running session and I do not notice it until I go to finish a run.  It stops tracking my distance and time.  This gets quite annoying. Please look into this. Using a Oneplus 3T running Android 8.0.",
        "I have pro version. I bought after evaluating light version. Now it feels i bought ransomeware. As developer demanding ransom for few additional features. He is using loyalty of old buyers to sell additional features , to new buyers. And old buyers have to pay additional ransom. He has to develop new app to sell new features. As new amount is recurring payments. Hate this attitude",
        "I bought the app to have all the features, and now all has been taken away and now YOU GUYS WANT MORE MONEY!!! give me back my features I have already paid for. I really don't care for the new fetures. I know I wont get  a response, but just wanted to join with all the others that already paid for this app before."

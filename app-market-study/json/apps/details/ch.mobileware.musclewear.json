        "Unusable For Us Metric-Tards Unfortunately while I learned metric in school its simply not second nature like imperial.  I have to look up and convert each weight which makes having this on my watch pointless.",
        "Musclewear What a great app, works perfect on moto 360 and note 3 easy and accurate to use. Have tried a few apps now but this is by far the best, and less complicated to use. A print or email workout option is all that's missing. Well done.",
        "Good app Really needs to buzz when rest period is finished then would give 5 stars",
        "Needs lbs Much needed app but needs the option to change to lbs",
        "It's not bad It's a good app, simple to use and effective.",
        "Can't wait to fully implement this I've been waiting for an app exactly like this since I got my wear. I've plugged in my workout from today to get a feel for it and I love it. The only thing is, I know most weights are marked for KG and LBS, but could you include a setting option for that? Thanks for the awesome app and I'll be sending more feedback to the email listed as I use it more."

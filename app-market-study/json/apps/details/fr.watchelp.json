    "description": "Watchelp is a mobile app that enables autonomy for all children and people with cognitive and mental disorder (Alzheimer, Parkinson, Autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, Down syndrome, Brain injury, Huntington disease...) and lightens the burden on parents and professionals. It works on a connected watch.The application will program a series of step by step tasks. The instructions come in the form of text, pictures or pictograms on a connected watch that vibrates to alert the users. WatcHelp Interactive allows parents or professionals to always keep in touch with the user, whatever the distance. It requires that a Smartphone is synchronized with the watch and carried at all times by the user. The user can answer the caregiver’s questions with a simple YES or no button on the watch. All connected watches work this way if your need to connect remotely.",

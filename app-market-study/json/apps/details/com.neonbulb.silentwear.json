        "I used to use Tasker for this. But let's face it, it was complicated/cumbersome/obscure/not user friendly. Now that I have found this app, my life is simple (AND efficient) again :)  Hurray!",
        "Awesome! Where the wear app fails.. this app comes to the rescue. Thank you!",
        "Works as it should Does exactly what it says it does, simple and effective, what more do you want! Works on both moto 360 2nd gen and g watch r.",
        "Schedule Please implement a schedule feature. Time and day.",
        "Won't show up on my LG G. After numerous resyncs and enables it still doesn't show on my watch. Please fix.",
        "Must have app for Wear Great and useful app. I keep my phone silent when I'm wearing my G Watch. Now I don't have to think about resetting the sound when my watch is charging. It is on my short list of must have apps. Great work."

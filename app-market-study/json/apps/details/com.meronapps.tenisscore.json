        "A good start but missing features Easy and simple to use.  Can't change any settings,  so can't specify who starts serving,  when tie break happens,  or even how many sets to play. It's a good start but would appreciate some ability to change settings. When using the app it's also a bit too easy to give someone a point and a bit too hard to undo the point (by swiping up)."

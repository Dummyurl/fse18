        "Nice, clear, easy to use. Possibility to save various profiles would render 5 stars Easy to use, and extremely clear interface. Tried using it with a separate HRM app, and it worked reliably when using a watch face supplied by the watch hardware supplier. Using Watchmaker watch faces sometimes lead to forxed exiting from the HRM app. This probably was due to overpowering the watch's hardware capabilities. If various interval settings, as in workout profiles, could be saved I'd give it 5 stars. Sound instead of vibration would be good, too.",
        "Unfinished, could be great This so could be perfect. The interface and the functionality are both ideal. But you have to manually set up your intervals every time you use it, which makes it completely useless. It will only be usable when it becomes possible to define and store interval configurations on the phone and select them on the watch.",
        "Great This is (almost exactly) what I was looking for. I needed an Android Wear app that I could use to time my slides presentation for class and this is the one I'll use. I would live it even more if it continued working with the display turned off. Another nice feature would be if we could set multiple different timers.",
        "Really like this app, however it would be dramatically improved with a more efficient option to adjust seconds. I'd love to be able to adjust the number of seconds by 15 (or 10 or even 5) instead of just 1, so I'm not tapping on my watch dozens of times to change from a 2:00 interval to 2:30. Otherwise, it's perfect for timing breaks in the gym.",
        "Crashes my moto360 The timer runs well but consistently crashes my moto360 on long runs. The only way to recover is to coonect to charger at home. Not a battery issue since there is still 50% battery left.",
        "Useful, but not perfect I use this app on a daily basis, but currently my two gripes are  1) When I start the timer and turn the display off (by side button or palm over the watch) the timer notification card goes away (and stops running).   2) The app remembers everything but the number of repeats. I always set this to infinity; I'm not sure why it forgets this detail."

        "Very good app in terms of what it allows you to do but the locations are very inaccurate. I live in Crawley which is in South East England and the app tells me I live in Sutton which is in Surrey. This then renders most of the app's functions useless as none of the 'nearest places' are anywhere in the nearby vicinity. Please fix this!!",
        "11 out of 10 !! Truly unique and mastered this corner of the market. By far the best app,  functions and user friendly options; can set to my own unique look and config. Would recommend to all; especially to anyone inquisitive as App inspiring and unique, not just mainstream mediocrity, but merging you directly in to Storefronts, Platforms or Venues. A conglomerate of businesses, helpfull and not always profit driven, with like-minded friends. I gurantee satisfaction, so much to do, play with  and try... Truly Great....I really cant put my phone down :-)",

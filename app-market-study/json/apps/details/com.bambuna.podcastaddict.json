        "This is a great app! I subscribe to alot of Podcasts and this app lets me store them all in one place & even have them download automatically! Lots of good features. definitely a 5 star app!  Except now when the widget and the menu on the pull down screen has STOPPED WORKING! Will give 5 Stars when fixed. Thanks",
        "This is a great podcasting application, the best I've found. My only criticism is that I can't find the \"New Podcasts\" or \"Downloaded Podcasts\" pages. Periodically when the app syncs it gives me two notifications one about X number of new podcasts, another about Y number of downloaded podcasts. Clicking on those notifications brings me to a nice screen with those new items displayed. If I accidentally close the app, or silence the notification I have no way of returning to those screens until I receive another notification (the next time one of my podcasts publishes new content). Please, if you could, add links to those pages so they can be visited on demand, instead of simply through the notifications.  Edit: Based on you're comment I've given this a 5 star. I have to say this is exactly why I love this application. Everything is configurable!!! Also, amazing support, thanks for your help!",
        "I like this app. It is easy to use and I have found every podcast I have looked for, so it has an extensive library.  The only issue I have had is that sometimes it stops working. Even when I'm on WiFi and my phone is not moving, the app will stop playing the podcast. It is not that it is searching for a signal, it just stops playing. But that said, I still recommend it.",
        "This is a fantastic podcast app with a lot of functionality and customizability. The UI seems a little daunting at first but you just have to play around with the app and the settings a bit to get it the way you like. I've used this app for a few years now and I've never wanted for anything. Definitely recommend.",
        "Google Pixel XL (first version).  Great app, hope it doesn't change in ease of access. Well organized, efficient, great download speeds, and intuitive.  Only criticism, and not so much a technical one, UI graphical interface can be improved without a deficit to performance.  I downloaded this for function so 5/5.",
        "It works good, I downloaded it because it is works with Android Auto in my car. Initially I thought I would have to download all episodes to listen in my car but I got a message from the developer saying I would fix that in my settings so now I can stream them through my mobile network. Thank you!"

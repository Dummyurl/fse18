        "Hello,  I purchased this version to use on my smart watch and it installed successfully, however while customizing it I removed the settings shortcut from the launcher page and now I cannot access the settings or get back into edit mode. I am stuck in the launcher with acess two only two apps (camera and gallery) and I cannot hard reset my watch either. Is there an alernative way to get back into edit mode by touch only? Looking forward to any tips as I have run out of options.",

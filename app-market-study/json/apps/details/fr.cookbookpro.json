        "Love the app but discovered out of the blue today that I was on a trial premium subscription and I'm now limited in the number of recipes I can backup unless I pay an annual fee. It's a shame but I'll be looking for another app - one that offers more transparency on what they're offering. Tricking users isn't a great way to create loyalty.",
        "Suggested changes are to have the option to convert between imperial and metric. Also, a timer function would be handy! No doubt more difficult is greater compatibility with more websites to get recipes - The guardian, chef steps, sorted food amongst others would be fantastic",
        "The best recipe clipper app on the market.  It blows the competition out of the water in that regard.  Easy and intuitive to use.",
        "No sync Unable to sync since last update. Please fix.",
        "Great way to keep all my favorite  recipies, whether from on line source or from one of my old hard copy recipies.  Also, it is easy to share my recipies on line or by printed copy.  I just love it!",
        "I primarily use it to access my Gourmet database on my tablet via Nextcloud sync. Works great, just requires occasional manual database export from Gourmet."

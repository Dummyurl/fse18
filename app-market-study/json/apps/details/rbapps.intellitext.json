        "I really like this app.  The MMS pictures show on my moto 360 just fine.  The responses work great as they are, although they can be customized as well.    I think the author should consider a free trial, because I think a lot of people would pay for this, if they knew for a fact that it worked on their phone/watch.  It's really good, but nobody seems to know about it.  I have tried it with chomp, verizon messaging, and the stock messaging app.  They all work good.  But it doesn't seem to play nice with Textra, so hopefully that gets worked out in a future build.  Very nice app, and well worth the 2 bucks.  A note to the author, though - give us the option to kill the toast message on our phone.  It isn't a deal breaker, and it's small, but I'd rather have the option to not have it there.",
        "Intellitext Needs work, developer could extend how long the message appears on your screen and allow you to send outgoing messages without waiting for someone to message you. Can you see previous conversations ? Upon testing during a work day it failed the ease of use test and missed calls and messages. I have now swaped to a different free app Drextee Messenger",
        "The phone interface is clunky and a bit tedious to set up.  What I'm most annoyed by though is the claim that the phone will receive MMS text and pictures, neither of which came through.  I don't know if there is anything I need to do outside of the instructions, but I was greatly disappointed that it didn't deliver as promised in the description. (Using a Moto 360.)",
        "Excellent Just what I was looking for. Adds so much functionality to Android Wear. Well worth the price.",
        "When i pressed dictations it gave a dam checkmark and did absolutley nothing",
        "Works exactly as promised."

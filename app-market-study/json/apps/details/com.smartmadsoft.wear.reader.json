        "Great for simple, free book reader on watch.  No issues downloading txt books from Gutenberg and transferring to watch, using the reader app on the phone itself.  Switching pages is a little clunky as you need to scroll for awhile to you get the end of an automatically created \"page\", then when you can't scroll further, long press the screen.  But this is all I wanted for times when I'm bored and can't really pull my phone out for one reason or another.",

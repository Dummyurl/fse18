        "Works great with my VeraEdge Z-Wave based home automation system. Been using Imperihome for years.  However I think the new monthly fees are excessive! Increase the one off app purchase fee if need be. But these monthly fees will drive new users away.",
        "Create an account? Really? I paid for the premium version only to be locked out of my house because they suddenly want me to create an account? Then I try to sign up and the form crashes constantly? The hell with this i'd like my money back",
        "Distinctly average. RFID support doesn't work, and don't bothering email support - they don't reply. It's an OK app, but not worth paying monthly for it. Can't wait for someone to fill the gap they've created with a better app.",
        "Yeelight option doesn't work. Scans for bulb then when it tries to validate says there is no bulb. This is with developer mode on and on the same network",
        "Pathetic. Monthly charge for a page payout. How childish.  I brought the premium app that no longer exist. I want refund now.",
        "Found yeelight bulb but not yeelight light strip."

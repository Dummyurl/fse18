There's one or two improvements that can be made (like adding a temperature converter with your other conversions, and a button on the graph screen to \"lock\" the screen in place so you can scroll on the graph, and maybe a feature that allows you to set the scale of the graph?), but the app is so awesome that it deserves 5 stars anyway ðŸ¤“.",
        "This is probably the best free calculator for Android. There are no ads. I'm docking it one star since it says 1 BTC =~ 700 USD. It's off by more than $3000 as of 9/19/2017. Currency converter needs auto update.",

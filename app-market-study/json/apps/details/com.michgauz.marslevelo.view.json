        "Great app but look out for bike scam in Marseille The app is faultless. Tells you how many bikes are available near you, navigates you to them - what more can you want. In Marseille, however, the system for locking your bike back into the dock doesn't work well and even when the green \"docked\" light comes on it's still possible that someone can steal the bike. Result: your credit card gets billed €150 each time this happens. My advice: in Marseille, get a taxi. It's cheaper."

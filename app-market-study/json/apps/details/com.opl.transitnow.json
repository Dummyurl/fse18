        "This app is almost always completely accurate. I like that I can set my favorites so that I don't have to go looking for the nearest stop all the time. Only complaint is some times the notifications don't show up in app for me, I don't know why though. And I can still read them on my phone notification so it's not a huge deal. Honestly, great app if you have to use the ttx.",
        "It hasn't been that reliable lately and there's some problematic bugs that have prevented me from using the app properly. For instance just now I tried to search Westbound 503 arrival times and it is only giving me Eastbound.",
        "I use transit daily and depend mostly on this app. I've tried others but I find this one to be most accurate.",
        "Next bus ETA is not always accurate, but the app has a direct link to the TTC website/schedules so it's relatively easy to figure out",
        "Very useful... i always check before i walk out my house... when the next bus will arrive.",
        "Great App. Just wondering why there is no updated version of the Subway Map .."

        "Excellent! I reverted to the old Spotify version and it works flawlessly.  Next paycheck I'll be donating!  One thing that would be nice to add is the radio tab.  On the PC and Mobile version i have recently listened to radio stations based on tracks.  If that could be implemented it would be even better.  But again, it's fantastic!  Thank you so much!",
        "Just brilliant Never has an app given me more than I asked for. It's got lyrics, your whole Spotify profile and everything. Wonderful. Just wonderful. I am sorry I can't make a donation since I am broke myself(college student), but I am sending my love. Keep up the great work.",

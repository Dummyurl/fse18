        "Saved my night I accidentally set the lock screen with a task that locked my phone with a key I could not remember. I remotely installed this and used my watch to launch the antidote task. Thanks. Did exactly what I hoped it would.",
        "Easy to use but can use improvements I like the easy way of executing tasks on the phone from my wear but I think a few minor improvements are welcome. First I would like to bookmark tasks in order to execute them faster, now it's just an alphabetic list of the tasks. This could be more efficient. Second I would like the app to close itself after executing a task, now it just returns to the list of tasks. I thinks these are minor improvements that would make the experience more refined, something I expect of a paid app. Nice job!",
        "Just what I was looking for Nice simple little app that fits right in with the Wear aesthetics. Straight forward configurations, and highly responsive dev.",
        "Good Would be nice to have be able to build a specific list of Tasker tasks just for the watch.",
        "Perfect Tiny, but functional. It would be nice to launch tasks directly without entering into the app... Thanks anyway",
        "Close Would be nice if this was formatted better for the Moto360."

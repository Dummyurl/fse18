        "I can't seem to get this app to work on the Huawei P10 plus. Help!  Thank you",
        "Very good app",
        "Worked great on Android 7 and continues to work great on Android 8.0 (pixel xl).  This is an app I can't live without and I'm shocked Google hasn't built it into the OS after all these years.  Definitely worth buying the pro version or the license so the developer gets paid for their hard work.  It's well earned.",
        "My Meizu M3 Note doesn't light the notification light when charging. This is annoying. I thought this app might be able to fix that. That's the only thing I tried because that's all I needed, and it didn't work, so I uninstalled.",
        "When did you guys got so greedy. I appreciate a pro/licensed version for some features but everything that this app stands for is paid. Alright the price is low but some of us aren't using credit cards etc.",
        "It was a brilliant idea that had alot going for it but then Instagram decided money was more important then humans sharing ideas and thoughts. Does the job until the next new idea comes along to then be imposed upon by capitalism."

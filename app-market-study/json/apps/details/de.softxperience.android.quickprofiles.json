        "As good as Nokia profiles I used to be a long time user of Nokia phones. When I shifted to Windows phone and later to Android, the one feature of Nokia I missed very much was the different profile. But this app is really at par with Nokia profiles. You can create new profiles & customise as in Nokia, even better. Really handy when you need to set volume levels at once. A big thanks to developer.",
        "Edit: Fixed stated bugs. Back to 5* Earlier: But for these issues, it could get five stars. Issues: 1. When you change the profiles that show up as shortcuts on homescreen, they don't change till you swipe the screen ... this wasn't the case before three updates. One tap on the profile and it would change asap, not now  2. The names change to stock name: 'Quick Profiles' and discard the ones that have been given. Pl fix this.",
        "My profile switching application ever since I started using Android. It's been fairly reliable over the years. But I still have hiccups with setting display brightness.",
        "Not up to date Used to be a very good app but no longer works 100% with Marshmallow and my S7. Needs a bit of development.",
        "Exactly what I want - only manual switching. Like old good Nokia. Works great. Thank you! (Marshmallow, Galaxy S7 edge)",
        "Working ok in my Samsung tablet A6 android 7. One thing missing in setup is flight mode otherwise everything is ok"

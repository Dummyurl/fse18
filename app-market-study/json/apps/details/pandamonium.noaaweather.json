        "I've tried a number of forecast apps in the past. I recently got a new phone and thought \"I should try different weather apps again\", so I did. I was using Dark Sky, as well as google's weather, and the weather from Bixby. It all simply pales in comparison to what they've put together here. No service is more accurate, no service is easier to see your forecast, and no service has as a many options for what kinds of alerts you get.   Sure, it's not the prettiest app in the world, but it looks good enough, and the information available far outweighs any lackings in the design.",
        "Update as of 12/31/17... The map is still showing the weather from yesterday .What is up with that?? Need a fix pls!!! That is not acceptable. My other weather app is fine. Uninstall on the horizon!!",
        "Because I enjoy a full weather reading with temperature, wind chill, gusts, and more this app excels. I've tracked hurricanes using the map, sent clearly understood screenshots to family and more.",
        "I live on a island off the coast of Maine, so weather is both important to anticipate, and difficult to do so. This is the most accurate app by far. And the descriptions are clear and detailed.",
        "No nonsense, unintrusive app with easy to navigate maps and forecasts. And if you're willing to wade through the weather jargon, the Forecast Discussion is insanely detailed and accurate.",
        "Poor radar, I'm watching the snow storm 1 mile from me snowing heavily and app shows 30 miles away"

        "Very easy to use and interpret, the library of tracks and sectors is better than you could expect...a ripper for motos.",
        "Does not give you a clue how to play so not a clue what to do",
        "Brilliant!",
        "Excellent, elle fait l'essentiel et est très précise / pro avec une base de données circuit complète et les partiels / données complètes accessibles pour chaque session! Top!",
        "Hi, not sure I like the new layout when driving. I race a Formula Ford, and while racing you have little time to check the dash. I preferred the big RED & GREEN indicators for whether I was up or down in terms of time, it's much easier to see while racing or qualifying. Perhaps you can have a configurable  dash. Thanks D"

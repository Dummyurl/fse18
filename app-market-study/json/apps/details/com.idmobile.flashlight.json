        "Great app! But, since the most recent update my flashlight only stays on for a few seconds before shutting off. Can't figure out how to fix it. Galaxy Note 8",
        "I have had this app for a very long time and I am very proud if it because of how often I actually find myself using it. However in a recent update the app no longer persists when the lock screen turns off and it shuts off the light. When I changed the automatic turnoff to ten minutes nothing changed rendering this app only annoying now. I really appreciate the simplistic design of the app and it is way more responsive than any other shake light but this one issue really makes me want to not use this. I only get like 10 seconds of light at a time now. If I could either find a way to make my lock screen stay open longer or make the app light persist after the screen turns off then I would have no issue anymore.",
        "Been using this app on my pixel v1 since the minute I took it out of the box. Works great everytime",
        "Used to work great. Now the lock screen shuts down after a few seconds and the light shuts off.",
        "Doesn't work on S8+ at all",
        "Pros: Easiest flashlight to turn on, most of the time my phone goes from pocket to hand and with a flick of the wrist I have a tiny phone sized but bright light, anywhere needed.  Cons: Occasionally app needs to be switched back on because it will not work with a shake.... Still very easy app to use been using it for years, most used app on my phone. Thanks"

        "Cant use it Thought it'd be a nifty tool to see if it really was correct, though there's no app on the watch to open and the phone app is just a donation screen, shame :( my inner nerd was quite excited when I saw this, as I didn't think  there was a tool that could do it.",
        "This is very nice app to use your watch as exposure meter. I will see how accurate it is in the next days.   I wonder if it can be made a bit smarter (1) do S mode calculation i.e. select aperture when speed is fixed. (2) use auto iso with minimum shutter speed. Exposure meters have a bunch of small nifty features.  PS I tested it along side my Minolta Vf meter and the results are surprisingly similar. Only caveat is to not point the watch perpendicular to the light source as it lacks dome diffuser and it will tend to report one stop more light.  PSS I wonder if flash metering is possible.",

        "Some glitches but it works. I liked the concept but this app crashes every time I try to share from my Moto X to my 360.  Update- reinstalled, doesn't crash anymore, but nothing appears on my watch.     Update 2- figured out some of the nuances of the app. Can't share from textra because that's where the app was crashing. It works when sharing from the gallery.  Also you have to share twice to get it on the watch, once from the app, then again from the notation drawer. Not exactly seamless, but it works. Upgrading my review to 3 stars",
        "Awesome idea but a couple of problems please fix them :) 1) pictures that are portrait are rotated... why???... fix it.  2) pictures are not zoomable.. idk if that is possible it it is pleaseeeeee add that! 3)Make the notifications appear ONLy on the watch without showing up on the phone Otherwise very useful!",
        "Potential I Like this app, but not everything is shared on my Gear Live.  Text goes through and sometimes pictures.  Sending web address appears on watch just like a text. I don't have web on my watch so I don't know if that changes anything. If I send address back to phone, nothing happens.",
        "Awesome App I use this everyday, simply type a short list into phone and send it over to your watch and it's there till you swipe it away. It's very useful I love it",
        "Great app It is very useful app, would be cool if it had tasker integration to allow you to send a notification of text from a plugin in taker, you should look in to that :)",
        "Love this concept, unfortunately the website share feature is not working."

        "Very dishonest company. I bought premium version cross platform. I changed mobile phone and i cannot get but the free version and the one on my pc doesnt work because ut says i have used too many devices. I have contacted them several times but they never get back to me. Dont buy it!",
        "This app is garbage equivalent to EA games. Doesn't let you do didly till you upgrade to premium. I can't remove it from my device and is just taking up space that could be used for useful apps.",
        "Used to be very good untill the last update that not only interrupted my work, logged me off, erased my unsaved file, made it totally unrecoverable, but also eliminated the most needed function for my project. I'm not able to move the inserted pictures with drag and drop. And that's called improvement??!! I would give 0 stars now if I could.",
        "Garbage.  Tried to open a document to upload to PC while sitting in a quiet office and a BLARING AD PLAYED.  Thank you devs, for almost getting me in trouble. Assholes.",
        "I just spent 20 bucks to upgrade to the add free version with additional features and now all my files are gone and the adverts are still there.  What gives guys? Could you please verify this and fix the dilemma.",
        "Sorry to say but it is not yet ready to call perfect. Too many ads make it difficult for the user to use it. But I respect the creater of this app............ Waiting for next update."

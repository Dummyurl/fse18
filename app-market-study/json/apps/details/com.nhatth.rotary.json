        "Great idea Neat interface and definitely something I would enjoy using if not for a few issues. 1. Retracting animation is too slow, please speed up. 2. Show the entire number to be dialed. 3. Be able to backspace a number without having to flick your wrist and dump everything.  Very novel approach to the wrist dialer and with some tweaking you'll have a five star app!",
        "Great idea. I was just thinking about this the other day Will this work on the U8 smartwatch",
        "Fun app. Now you can truly \"dail\" someone."

        "Full of dark UX patterns (false sense of urgency etc) and user hostile behaviour such as not being transparent about the pricing up front, different prices on different platforms and regions.  \"Discounted prices\" is usually the ordinary rate of the hotel.  Logged in session handling is not working as intended either, you get logged out all the time from the app.",
        "Last couple of months it has stopped showing all hotels especially in the map view. Sometimes show and sometimes not, even I clear all search filters. Had to start using Agoda and Tripadvisor for more reliable hotel listings.",
        "Fairly easy to find and book hotels if you have an account.  Didn't have a smooth experience though: the app logged me out during a transaction and screwed up a reservation, so I had to call customer service to get it fixed.",
        "Great, simple to use and book hotels. Prices include all the local taxes etc that some other sites don't, so no nasty shocks when you get to the check out pages.",
        "Great app! I travel a lot and sometimes need a last minute solution for lodging. I haven't been let down yet!",
        "No no no no no,why do I need notifications to remind me I have a reward or anything else. I wanted this app for booking and managing reservations, not to bombard me with junk information, and why is it running in the background draining my battery ...... App fail, will have to stick to the web version for now."

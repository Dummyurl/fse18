        "It worked at 1st Im deleting it! It used to worked good at first I'm not really sure what happened but it takes pictures how wants to so sometimes your pictures come out upside down or at a dramatic angle almost sideways for no reason or extremely zoomed in but when youre looking in the lens when you're taking it it shows you completely different normal  picture it wast of time I DONT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!",

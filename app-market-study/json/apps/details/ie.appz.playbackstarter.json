        "Moto X + Moto 360 Great app, work like magic! Please add option to change the background on selection menu (transparent option would be perfect). Apps in two rows and filter by recent used would be great",
        "Perfect Such an important app for me to easily start listening when my phone is in my pocket or hard to access.",
        "Worked well, but please add Apple Music support Just launches Apple Music, doesn't play anything, annoying",
        "This is wonderful. Now I can start Spotify and Pocket Casts straight from my watch, ready to play or browse. Thank you!",
        "works wonderfully I happen to have a bug in which two instances of soundcloud appears but otherwise works flawlessly! also wish we could customize the icon, the checker is a bit of an eyesore",
        "Thanks for this! It works perfectly! I was going crazy trying to find a reliable way to start Pocket Casts playback from the watch and this is it. It works on the first try every time. Thanks!"

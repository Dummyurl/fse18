        "Great support... And it works! When I initially bought this app, it was pretty much completely nonfunctional.  Contacted support, and they genuinely seemed eager to help... But no dice! Alas!  I've checked in a few times, just to see if maybe something got reworked. FINALLY, it appears that the dev has worked out the kinks, and it works pretty... Pretty... Pretty good. UI could use some tweaking, but who am I to complain?! Well done!",
        "Three stars - to get the last two it needs any two of the following: - Option to remove the voice button - it being first, and futzy enough to want to remove makes me sad.  Alternatively, allowing reordering of devices/buttons (including the voice one) would be a fine answer here.  - Support unlocking doors - I can't think of the occasion I've had my watch and phone without my keys and wanted to /lock/ the door.  Ideally support both, but if you can only do one, let me choose unlock. - Limited use case - single-toggle-mode;  On opening the app, toggle a single thing (like say, my lock) automatically - a la open app, unlock door automatically, done.  All around it's pretty good, but with my home devices always listening anyhow - the thing I want my smartwatch to be able to do is manipulate my smartlock.",
        "It's great since it's the only app that lets you control smartthings from your watch but wish the interface would be a little more intuitive. Scrolling through 15 switches if you don't want to use voice is no fun. Still appreciate it and will support the developer to encourage more updates to the app!",
        "I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews -- it works flawlessly and I couldn't be happier. It's nice being able to open up locks, my garage, and lights all using my watch!",
        "App just crashes. Is this app even supported?",
        "Works great Much better response time than IFTTT for unlocking doors, could you possibly put an option to remove the voice option/icon? as it just takes me longer to get to the command I need."

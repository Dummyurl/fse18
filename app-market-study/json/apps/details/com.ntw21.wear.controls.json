        "Looks nice on Google Play, never appears on watch. Appears on the phone so you know it installed.   But never appears on the watch.  Don't waste your time.  Nothing to see here (on your watch) .",
        "No go. App does not appear on my LG G watch R and when I open the app on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 I just get an information screen and nothing else.",
        "Doesnt work on 360 as someone else said.  *** EDIT ***  New version still doesn`t work. however increased to 3 stars because developer took time to reply to first review AND tried to fix problem.",
        "Not working yet on moto360 Looks awesome but I cannot get it to launch says unfortunately controls has stopped as soon as I try to launch it",
        "Well, I tried. Never appeared in the Zen Watch. But, the Zen got herky jerky, and suddenly started nagging about missing Google Play Services. I factory reset watch and started over again. Sigh. The dev's stopwatch app works great though. Go figure.",
        "Fake. Don't show on watch"

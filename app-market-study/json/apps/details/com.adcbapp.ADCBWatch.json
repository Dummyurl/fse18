        "Is this an app or a joke seriously a big bank such as ADCB always last in the line for apps implementation this app is a complete joke has never worked for me not a single time since they lunched it way back, I whish from management of ADCB to check the apps development department quality control which is the worst, not only this app is bad, the main app also bad very bad UI basic not a single new feature.  Dear ADCB, I would be great if you can just download and try other banks apps such as Abu Dhabi First bank, Emirates Dubai bank, Dubai islamic bank, city bank and etc All these banks has smart features Mobile wallet, mobile payment, NFC payments, amazing UI, great watch apps and token apps,  what is your app ecosystem provide from these ? Nothing.  just check the deference in the app management and quality of these apps in terms of design and features, as an ADCB loyal client for a very long time now I and many others requesting you please higher a better dev team than what you have so they can learn something and design any good app for this beloved bank   I'm sure nothing from this complain will reach to the managers from ADCB   Very disappointed",

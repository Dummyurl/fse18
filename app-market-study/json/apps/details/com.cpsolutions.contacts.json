        "I can't add more contacts. I can't enlarge their heads. I can't resize the size of the app. I can't have the app open like it was on the V10 so I can hit the contacts head and either call or message. I haven't been able to find another app in the store that's better than this one. Until I do I'm stuck with this you need to do something to fix it. This is why I'm giving you one star only.",
        "Does what I want, so I really like it. I wish it would just automatically call the person when you first touch the contacts square instead of making you do a few clicks. But that is my only complaint, so obviously a minor one :)",
        "I world rate they app better if it did what it's supposed to do.  If you set a default number, it does not automatically call....I have to open the app, click on my favorite, then hit the number....just may go back to my other favorites...not that I want to with the system update putting all my favorites in alphabetical order with no ability to re order them",
        "It does save me some time searching contacts but has a few bugs that are annoying on my LG G6. Like sometimes it won't display or scroll the favorites. 3.5 stars might be more appropriate.",
        "I loved this widget/app until it started to rearrange my favorites with no apparent rhyme or reason. Since the latest update, the problem appears to be gone. I deeply appreciate the developer addressing and fixing the problem so quickly! A 5 star app with 5 star customer service!! Thanks!!!",
        "I arranged the first four contact because I call them everyday. But if I call someone, somewhere else in the grid, the whole grid Scrabbles, and I have to find my everyday friends again. Not coolðŸ˜µðŸ˜µðŸ˜µ"

        "I know daraz is a very good place to shop by online. But suddenly I ordered a hot wheels from daraz.I got a massage from daraz which told me they are giving my hot wheels In 8 hours. But it is almost 24 hours but my hot wheels isn't arrived. I call the man who was delivering my parcel told me he couldn't gave my parcel that day. His name was RAJU DELIVER. He told me he may give my parcel today . But where is it . This makes me very dissatisfied from daraz.",
        "I love daraz. I've been shopping on daraz for years. The thing is, some of the makeup products on daraz are bit too pricey. I can actually go to a local store and find the same products in much cheaper price. I don't know why you guys are charging 100/200 bucks extra. But I still love you anyway ‚ù§",
        "This is a very good app for online shopping. I am very fond of it. But about 3 months ago I ordered a card for PLAY STATION for 2500 rs. When I used it, I came to know that it is expired. I called the man who shipped it but he did not give a reasonable response. This isn't a good fact about the app",
        "When i ordered something it says that my number is invailed but i give them all right information but they all time says it is invalied this is the worst online shopping app i ever seen     Updated:- ididnt putted +88 before my number. And their product quality is good enough. It has some small bugs pls fix that in next update",
        "Poor service, poor business strategy. I made a few orders and every order came separately which is very irritating and inconvenient. I requested to store all my orders as they arrive and ship to me altogether. Also, the Treadmill was delivered to me not set. I had to set it up myself. They delivery guys don't understand written addresses and calls over and over.",
        "Cheated From Daraz I ordered some products.  They have too many issues. Can't deliver every item in 1 period of time. Delivery rate is slow.  Response rate is poor. Then one item they gave me something else instead of something I ordered for."

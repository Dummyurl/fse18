        "Update: Nice new home screen! Just began to use this app after I hadn't used it in a long while. I like the updates that have been made. Would love to see this app somehow connect with the MYCHART app by EPIC. All hospitals are trying to give patients access to as much information as possible from their medical charts through the EPIC system. This would be an awesome update.",
        "Since it's new, I'm giving it 4 stars because it offers alot of features that is worth using and very convenient. Once they include more pharmacies and hospitals everywhere, I will upgrade to 5 stars. Update, have been using it for about 3 weeks now and when I visited 2 Doctors so far and it's been very helpful documenting the meds, times meds were taken and doses. It's very convenient and easily accessible. I like the diary feature, it's where I note sudden changes in my vitals. The color codes should be customizable for ones own needs. This app is very close to earning 5 stars.",
        "Awesome app. The only thing I wish they had was a reminder from the last time I took a med. (For example, pain meds every 6 hours.) Otherwise, very easy to use and awesome for keeping track of everything. I love the little med graphics that are different for pill color, size, or even needles or inhaler, etc. Very customizable.",
        "So helpful as with my medication if I forget to take my meds I feel it by the end of the day and for days after. Was a bit frustrated when you press take and you need to make a selection, because I tend to forget to record it straight away but the \"shake to take\" makes it a non-issue. Would love if you could set up pets as other members and for medication courses which are not daily, like dog worming or for some people injections. Have recommended this app to others who need help remembering meds.",
        "I have epilepsy. After 2 very scary extended blackout incidents in Jan & Feb, my son found the Medisafe app. So easy for me to enter meds, but the best part is having 3 people who will let me know when I miss anything. I showed my neurologist, she was so excited and she says she will recommend it to her patients. Thanks!",
        "Very easy to use, very flexible,  and extremely helpful. Since I downloaded the app about a year ago I haven't had to worry about rememberimg to take any of my meds and more importantly IF I'd taken them(it was a daily dilemma)! Highly recommended"

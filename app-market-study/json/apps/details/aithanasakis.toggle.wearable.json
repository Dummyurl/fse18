    "description": "This is a free app that i made, because i couldn't believe that there are not these basic fucntions like Find my Phone (who doesn't lose his phone between the pillows, or leave it somewhere), or toggles to enable /disable wifi or bluetooth and vibration settings, preinstalled on my android wear watch. So this is a pretty simple app, that works both on round and square watches and let's you efficiently control the following settings: -Find your phone! (It will whistle to you! :) ) - Watch out for the second app icon on your watch!-Enable/Disable WiFi-Enable/Disable Bluetooth-Put your phone on vibrate-Put your phone on silent modeIt's basic, simple and it works.This app is totally free but is ad supported for its development. Each time you search for your phone an add will pop (only Google admob ads nothing intrusive nor notifications). Next update a compass will be added...Thank you!",

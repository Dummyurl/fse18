        "Works just perfect on my device. There is a little learning curve for getting the best out of it, but then everything is just logical and the app is running just fine on my phone since weeks now. Thank you!",
        "Couldn't understand how to get it to work.",
        "Works great",
        "Great app, but needs one feature Can you please allow the app to respect the phone's Silent Mode and not vibrate the Wear? It wakes me up at night unless I temporarily disable Notification Access for WCV on the phone. Otherwise, perfect!! Arigato! ^_^"

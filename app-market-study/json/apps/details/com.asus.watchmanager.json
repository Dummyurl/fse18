        "App harassed me with notifications to turn on my location setting constantly, if I turned it off. I turn off my location all the time to save my battery and this app would not stop sending me notifications every few seconds even after I took away all its permissions and ability to draw over other apps and send notifications.  I have no idea what this app even did for my watch anyway, so good riddance.",
        "Setting and tweaking the watch face is quick and easy.  Watch faces are prominent and easy to navigate.  Settings are simple and to the point.  There are never too many details to have to consider, which can sometimes lead to customization overload.  All in all, ZW Manager is a highly effective app for customizing the ZenWatch 2.",
        "Newest update=BRUTAL! Aside from the restrictions to use my watch into the evening because my battery now gets completely drained, even though I used to be able to go two days, the entire set up is now a joke. How did I go from an awesome watch with easy navigation and convenient controls, to the invasive features of being able to change my watch face and having to take multiple steps to access simple features? Please fix! Don't make me resort to the fruit variety.",
        "Since. Update to android 2.0 cannot open this app? Keeps saying to update but not telling you were? I unstalled re install WHY IS MY WATCH SAYING ITS ACTIVE EVEN DO ITS NOT INSTALLED",
        "After the new update I can not connect at all anyhow watch with my Asus phone at all. ZenWatch manager get stuck and there is no Bluetooth option on watch after reset. Battery dead and no change to set up it, so I can throw them now, good! Choose different brand",
        "Baaad Battery consumer.   Uninstall it.   The day I installed it gave it 5stars. For the style of app design and watch faces.  It swallows the battery backup so fast. From 40 hours backup to 4 hours. I tried everything, finally had to unpair, uninstall and pair it again.  Asus has to do something about this. Its bad for the reputation of the watch."

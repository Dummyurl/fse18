        "It does not work on Android. And because of this I am late to work. It's very inconvienent. I would like it more if it was compatible with Android as it is with IOS. Give me an old-fashioned key.",
        "Preformance has increased dramatically with Android phone. Still doesn't seem quite as good as Apple's but close",
        "People say it doesn't work for android, I've never had an issue.",
        "Got \"unexpected error\" where all of sudden I couldn't log in...meaning I couldn't get into my office!  Uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixed it so if getting that error try that",
        "Running into same \"unexpected error\" on Android app.  iOS app is working it seems as well as web dashboard.",
        "Newest version now prompts me every time I open it to turn on NFC, despite having no way to use it to unlock a door. Obnoxious."

        "For me,  a true caller I.D. will not only show a phone number, but also show individual name and or name of business. I often see unknown, private, and blocked phone numbers. I also might add that I often see a phone number but no name associated with it. Additionally and lastly, this app I find my experience does not block text messages and UNWANTED SHORT CODES (often spam, solicitations, phishing, scams, etc.). If this can significantly improve, I will give this app a much higher or the highest rating.",
        "Do not shows the contact photo When a contact call me the APP only show me the person name. In my telephone I have the same contact in differents social account (Google +, Facebook, LinkedIn). How I can integrate all the social network to Whoscall Wear show me the contact photo who is calling me?",
        "Barely works Doesn't display names, it merely gives you the category if you wait more than 20 seconds while your phone is ringing. To slow, not useful information.",
        "Sad Let down doesn't  show up on my  phone's pages after being  installed,nothing happens when I get a call",
        "Annoying delay Keeps vibrating Moto 360.2 even after answered or cancelled on Galaxy Note 4 phone. Otherwise I like it.",
        "Doesn't work on SD card right. When I moved the app to the SD card, it doesn't work right on Moto 360."

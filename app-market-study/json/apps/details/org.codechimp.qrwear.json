        "A few weeks after I purchased this app, my watch upgraded to Android Wear 2.0 and since then the app no longer works at all. It does not appear on the app list on the watch. I contacted CodeChimp to tell them, and they never responded to my email.  ----------------------------------------------------- Update after CodeChimps reply to this review.  I re-installed the app, and it now works on my watch with Android Wear 2.0",
        "Best Android Wear App I've come across.   No more getting my phone out when I'm jumping on a plane, train or even when I'm pickup my coffee from Starbucks.   This is the awesome power of Android Wear!",
        "The codes displayed on my Watch Sport with a high ppi screen are way too small to read. They are just surrounded by a lot of white space.",

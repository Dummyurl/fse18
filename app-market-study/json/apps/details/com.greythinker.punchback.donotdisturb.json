        "Really do love this The phone number that came with my new phone also came with 2 robo calls with voicemails every day.  Altho i spoke with the co. And explained that the person they were trying to reach was no longer at this number - the calls continued.   After six months of clearing these calls every day i am deeply grateful for this solution.  Since i can't give you 6 stars, here are 5.",
        "Need help using the app I downloaded this app because I needed to block a number from calling my phone and being able to leave a voicemail. I checked out this app and saw so many great reviews. After downloading the app I saw awesome features but when I officically used the app and set the app the to not allow a certain number to call and leave  a voicemail, it would block the call but the caller could still leave a voicemail. Is there something I'm doing wrong when setting it up?",
        "Didn't work. Android version 5.1.1. Almost all recent reviews say it doesn't work. They must have broken it during an update them abandoned the project and everyone who downloaded it. Someone said they reached out to the dev with no reply. This app is useless. Nice design tho",
        "Does not work as advertised.  The number I have blocked still comes through about 3 times a day, however it says that in the \"block log\" that it has been blocked. Not sure what the problem is with this app as I do NOT have any other call blocker on my phone.",
        "Works very well Had a drunk family member CONSTANTLY calling up to and beyond 20 x a day and leaving absolutely terrible voicemails. She would only call to scream and insult me. I feel so free now!",
        "Best blocking app ever! Blocks the calls and does not send them to voicemail! I've been trying to block this particular twice a day spam caller for weeks. All the other apps just sent the call to voicemail. So I had to call voicemail everyday day to delete the messages. This app blocks the call and does not send it to voicemail!! Works perfectly!"

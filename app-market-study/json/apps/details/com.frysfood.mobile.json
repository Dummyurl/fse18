        "Well, how about you fix your coupon system I don't want to have to install an app on my phone just to get a good price, I would rather go to WinCo",
        "Cant see prices anymore The new( update) doesnt show any prices only discount",
        "I like that this app is easy to use. I can plan my entire grocery list plus corresponding coupons and then when im at the store i just swipe my frys card and the savings are instantly applied. Sure beats clipping coupons",
        "I love using the app and getting the extra savings but it only holds 149 coupons in my coupons.... And then it just errors if you try to add more",
        "This app sucks. Half the coupons that are listed in the add aren't available when searched. You can't just select a certain category to use. The Safeway app is way better.",
        "Good to have on the go. Even go on coupons."

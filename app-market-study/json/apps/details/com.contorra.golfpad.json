        "Bought the tags and was promised an extra year of premium due to a special price being offered 48 hours later but unfortunately after a years use it reverted to free.  I also bought the golf pad link which works well but there still seems to be a difference in the distance to hole displayed by the app compared to other gps devices",
        "It's a great app but the tags them selfs brake I have 3 of them break on me. Also when switching holes it sometimes wants to go back to the last hole you have played.",
        "Just started with this and still figuring it out, but so far it's pretty easy to use, gives me good yardages, and serves as a score card. That's all I ask.",
        "Absolutely brilliant and when you get to know the app and what it can do, it improves your game by letting you know exactly how far you hit each club, so the right club can be selected",
        "Best app I have used for score keeping. works with most smart watches. Could use more social features to use with friends.",
        "works perfect on the phone but can't seem to link it with my Samsung gear 3 frontier watch."

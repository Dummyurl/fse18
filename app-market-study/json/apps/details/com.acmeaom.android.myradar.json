        "Not exactly even accurate. Plus recently it started crashing. And it has always been extremely slow. There's really nothing good going for this app. I was just trying to get on it a couple minutes ago then my phone crashed when trying to use it then it just shut down my whole phone and restarted. Yeah hell no not having an app that does this and can't even correctly use the weather radar. Wasn't gonna review it until it shut off my phone. Screw this. Uninstalled",
        "Exactly what I was looking for, a high quality app with good detail and a smooth flow. Not grainy like other apps. Very smooth movement. I am very fussy with my weather apps and am so far more impressed with this one over the others. Installed 3/2/18 on Galaxy S7 with no issues, no lag, no crashing so far. Will update if I begin experiencing issues. Try it out.",
        "So far it has been a great app. We had 5 tornado warnings the other night and each and every time My Radar alerted me way before all the local stations and the emergency radio!!! Every second counts in situations like this!!",
        "Good program until the last update. Crashed my samsung note 4 multiple times. In between it made the phone lag so bad it was unusable.  Please correct the last update. Once uninstalled , note 4 worked great again.",
        "This App use to be awasome, , but now after the last update it just crashes even after reinstalling. Now I'm using the best FREE system there is, my eyes.",
        "I have a suggestion from those of us who are color blind. I have a hard troubles seeing greens from yellows and some purple from blues.   I was wondering if in a future version you would be able to remove the black box around the heaviness of the rain chart? I try to move the radar to the area next to the chart at the bottom to compare the colors but the blackness of the box won't allow me to almost lay it over top each other.   It's a great app and love it, although the last version is very slow to load.   Thanks!!"

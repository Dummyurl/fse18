        "Bus timing not accurate, can u all give LTA a wake up call? Pls add logic to remove buses from bus stops which are returning to the depo! (e.g 700A last bus at suntec Convention bus stop ) They don't fetch passengers! But the app shows it anyway. Learn that the hard way stranded past midnight. | Favourites should be first page | coming back, going out headers should have settings to auto hide.",
        "Been using this app for 2 months now. It's a good app but I can't get the notification to work no matter how I try. No notification for bus arrival, no notification for reaching destination as well. It just doesn't notify even when I've selected the necessary settings. My phone settings are also set to allow notification for this app. Using a Google pixel 2 xl.",
        "The user interface is great, however the app itself is quite unstable. Once I leave the app it starts slowing down my phone, and always crashes eventually. If this bug is fixed the app would be perfect.",
        "This app is a nightmare to use in the morning, timings constantly changing,  time travelling backwards etc.  Other than that,  it works almost perfectly.   Update : Developer claims to have fixed it but problems are still persisting.",
        "I subscribed for the paid version so that i can monitor the bus arrival time at notifications tab. It worked well previously but now no longer accurate and the time is frozen and won't update accordingly. Please fix this ASAP!",
        "This apps is ok but dont know why, when i edited and hid the bus at certain bus stop, the hidden bus stop will still keep appearing! Is there any way to hide the buses in certain bus stop?"

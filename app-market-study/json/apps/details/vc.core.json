        "Lame App that mostly crashes Have the matching sensor and it's rubish too. Won't connect to any computer I've tried, sometimes connects via this App.  The App just crashed over and over, totally unusable. I'm going back to Garmin.",
        "Should allow ant+ connectivity. Some phones have ant+. Like my Samsung galaxy note 3. Ant+ should be used to connect to the sensors as it would use less power and be more reliable. The smart sensors allow for ant+ connectivity. Why doesn't the app?",
        "Terrible. Doesn't keep the screen on during a ride, none of the export options actually work. Website is crap. No response from support.",
        "I went for a 15 minute ride to see how it worked and it had already stopped. Way too short of a demo to see if the app is any good.",
        "Smart usage of accelerometer for cadence. Sounds is a good feature too. i was surprised to hear how often my speed and cadence dross below my normal",
        "Some nice ideas but I could not get it to track runs properly. Gp s tracking dies as soon as you go under a bridge and does not pick up again."

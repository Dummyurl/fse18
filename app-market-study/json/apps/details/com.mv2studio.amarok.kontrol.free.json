        "Does not work.. Will give 5 stars if you guys could actually make a troubleshooting guide, port 8484 is not working & I don't see anywhere to change ports! (Running Ubuntu)",
        "Awesome app. Everything works flawlessly, can't ask for more but a better UI would make this app even more awesome than it already is. Thanks.",
        "Excellent app. Remember to find the IP of the machine running Amarok, and set it in the app. Also remember to open port 8484 in any firewall on that machine.",
        "This app is great. I am impressed with how well it works and how quickly it responds.  Thank you mv^2 studio. You are incredible",
        "The only thing that I'd add is the ability to play the Amarok library through the Android speaker.",
        "Works great Works excellent, although a little light on features. It would be great to be able to see and edit paylists in the app."

        "Horrible date picker, please change.  Works well with CooSpo chest strap and S8. Interface could do with improving. I like the alarm option but needs to be able to be more customisable as in several types of alarm at once and different/ custom sounds.  At this moment language can be either English or Russian.  Let me know if you'd like free help translating the app to Spanish. Keep it up.",
        "OK just got a garmin hrm-tri. Imagine disappointment when ant+ USB stick didn't support the strap.    Thus app appears to work it connects and records but need it to tell strap to record a sessoo n and then download it.  Want to download so might have to splurge for download capabilities.  So far it's ok.  Will add more as needed",
        "Tried several apps including Runtastic which used to work, but this was the only one that would connect to my Zephyr Hxm2 Smart HR monitor. The UI isn't Material, but if you want to see your heart rate zones and GPS history, this does that.",
        "Tested with Polar H7 band. Works very well.   Application does what I expected it to do. There are no problems with prolonged usage, tomorrow I ma going to have app run measurement for an entire day.  Edit : picked it up again and I cannot find my Polar H7 monitor in connect section. Did something change in application? It worked like charm during spring 2017. My hrm is instantly detected by polar beat software.",
        "(1) Stops responding if I don't give location permission, likely to stuck in an infinite loop. (2). Doesn't work with my ANT+ heart rate monitor, while Stava app and Cyclemeter app do. Already gave permission to access location & body sensors but it just doesn't detect my heart rate monitor. | xiaomi redmi note 3, android 6",
        "Not a good start. I've not even used it yet and ..  1. I had to press the back button 712 times to set my birth date, a truly appalling date picker, the worst I've ever seen, ever, anywhere, and I've been writing software since 1976. Unless you want to send me a birthday card why not just ask for my age?  2. I paid for the version that allows export of data and found that it still shows adverts, apparently there's another charge to remove the adverts.  3. You can uninstall it but you can't get a refund because \"As your item was available for immediate delivery you agreed to waive your statutory withdrawal period. See the Google Play Refund Policy and the Terms of Service.\" That's a new one on me.  I'll review this later when I've tried it, I hope I can give it some stars."

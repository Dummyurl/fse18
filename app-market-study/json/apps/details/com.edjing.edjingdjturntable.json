        "I HAD to come back and five-star this. So *intuitive*, it worked immediately after totally getting lost trying other apps. And then there was even more cool things to do! THANK YOU",
        "My phone does not have an sd card slot, so i use a micro usb on the go (otg) device on my phone to access music. Developers, please allow app to support otg devices; Disc dj app, a good dj app contender, has this feature. Also, kindly consider giving users the option of adding at least 1 custom sample (for example: Dj Wade, sound the big ting man). I am Jamaican 🇯🇲. Please add a back arrow for the samplers and keep up the good work!",
        "I love edjing so much ! Please add spotify music importing by the way 😇 . The last update can't handle 2 songs at once . it becomes rasping (i have the galaxy s8)",
        "Plz ur saving process is too slow...kal se Kara hai ab tk in progress bta rha....plz do it as soon as possible.. It's urgent",
        "Great app. But I just got a new phone & it says I have to pay for premium again.  Doesn't make sense at all. I still use the same Google account.. wish I could get this figured out",

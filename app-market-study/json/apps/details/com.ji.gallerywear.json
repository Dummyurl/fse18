        "app not worked can anyon share me how to slide gallary photo ?",
        "Great app.",
        "Great concept. Like the app, been wishing for something liked this. My only issue with it is that I have to keep opening it on my HTC M8 for the gallery to appear on the SW3. I couldn't dig deeper to find out why, it looks like this happens when my phone sleeps. Edit: Dev fixed the sleep issue. Thanks a mill."

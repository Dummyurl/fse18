        "Awesome! My favorite stopwatch app Beautiful design, an absolute eye catcher. Everything is perfect, the graphics, sounds, functionality,...  (nah... almost everything: the tab titles are split up in multiple rows, but that's just some cosmetics)",
        "I've been using this app for years. Love it. However this new version has a lagging issue with the counter and hand. Freezes for a few seconds (sometimes about 10+ seconds) and jumps forward to current time. Please fix this bug. Using Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S3.",
        "Stuttery This version 8.0.0 doesn't work smoothly on my Xperia phone.  The display freezes for two or three seconds at random intervals as the stopwatch is running.  That's fundamentally bad.  I've now reverted to an old version that works.",
        "A little disappointed. Beautiful design as some have said and I like the sweeping hand movement but that's all offset by the fact that the hand stops moving after running for more than it seems like 7 or 8 minutes. It's still counting but the hand is not moving then it just jumps to the correct time. Then it starts back with the sweeping motion again.",
        "The recent update This was (for me) hands down the best stopwatch / timer app available until some of the latest updates. Now I'm getting lags and freezes at an almost unbelievable rate. Plus I no longer am getting notifications when my timer goes off.",
        "Loved it, now won't notify upon timer completion. I've used this app for years and it truly was the ultimate. Now it won't notify me with either vibration nor sound when the timer has completed. I've tested other applications to see if it was a system issue, but all of my other timer apps work perfectly. I'll change to five stars upon fix."

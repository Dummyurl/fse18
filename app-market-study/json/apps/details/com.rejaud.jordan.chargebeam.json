        "Not metroid? Judging by the pictures in the store, I was expecting to hear something out of the metroid prime. All it is is just simply the standard power beam. I was hoping to be able to switch to plasma beam or wave beam or... SOMETHING MORE! It doesn't even sound/echo like the real thing. Where are you getting this sound from? Am I just... over expecting?",
        "Ya'll are kiddin' right? Try making the image the overhead view if the gun, pointing up, then you could put options keys along the edge of the gun graffic, so players could hold the device like a T.V. remote . ..Then turn their phone inward to press  those controls, and would look and feel like they were operating Samus' wrist console.  Then when set, they can hold it like a T.V. remote and use their thumb, now on top, to fire it. At l least that all makes SOME kinda sense. Not just a bad pic going bang bang... jeeeeeez..ðŸ˜•",
        ":/ Description misleading. No options and smash bros brawl isn't what people think of first when they think samus. Disappointed. Uninstalled.",
        "Images are misleading Based on the images in the App Store you would expect to hear sounds from the Metroid Prime series not Smash Brothers Brawl disappointing",
        "Can't. Switch BEAMS! I try to do every thing! Slide,put my hand like the shape of a beam i want to choose",

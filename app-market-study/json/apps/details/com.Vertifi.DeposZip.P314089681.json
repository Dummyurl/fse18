        "App messed up and there was a transfer issue. Now I have a $24 overdraft charge. Called \"money services\", excuse me \"member sevices\" and explained my issue, not a care in the world. If you use this app double check every transaction and fee. Or just go to a different Credit Union/Bank.",
        "Keeps locking up. When it works it's great",
        "I like the app but the bill pay is not working. I keep getting an error when entering the amount to pay and can't get past the screen to complete the payment information.",
        "This app wasn't showing the correct amount of money available so needless to say that charges were not showing up on hold . So that cost me over 150.00 on overdrafts fees . I never have had a overdraft with any of my banks . So they really need to get things fixed on this application. Cause it Only hurts the customers who depend on the the app to show all debit charges to be showing up .",
        "App keeps asking me to verify my phone number EVERY TIME open it up. This is getting really old really fast!",

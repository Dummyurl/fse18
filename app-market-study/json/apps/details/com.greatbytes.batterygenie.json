    "description": "Keep an eye on your devices' battery level and automatically get alerts when it's time to recharge.Grabbing your phone or tablet when you're leaving the house, only to realize that the battery is almost at zero can be a real bummer. Have Battery Genie alert you on your PC or Mac when your device's battery level is getting low to avoid being stranded with a dead battery.After installing the app on your devices, head over to the Chrome Webstore on your PC or Mac to download the corresponding Chrome extension ( http://goo.gl/oizBpA ). That's it! From now, any time you want to check on the current battery level of a device, simply click on the icon in your Chrome toolbar.For each device, you can set at which level the app should alert you of a low battery via a Chrome desktop notification. You can also configure alerts on the devices themselves (say, to get alerted on your phone when your tablet is about to run dry).**Features**- Keep track of the battery level of all your devices from the comfort of your desktop browser- Get reminders to charge your device ahead of time, not when it's already down to 1%- Configure alerts and see the battery levels on any of your devices**Setup**1. Download the app on all your Android devices2. On each device, open the app and follow the short connection process2. Download the Chrome extension from http://goo.gl/oizBpA**FAQ**Does my phone need to be on the same WiFi network as my PC/Mac?Nope, not at all. Syncing the battery levels of all your devices works automagically over the Internet.How's the battery usage of the app? Does it eat more battery than it saves?The app only updates the device's battery status if it actually changed by at least 5%, which ensures that it has close to zero impact on your device's battery. In fact, it might even save you some battery, as you don't have to turn on your screen to check if it's time to recharge.Do I need to create yet another account to be able to use the app?No, the app relies on your existing Google Account to manage the syncing of devices.Does  the app support Android Wear devices?Yes, support for smartwatches is baked into the app!Try the app for free for 14 days on as many devices as you own. Afterwards, upgrade to the full version for a one-time charge of $0.99. The app does not currently work with Google Apps for Business accounts.",

        "This won't detect my Moto 360 and my watch says it's installed but not seen on any devices. The trial ended and only had for only 10 minutes. I just wish I can see my laptop battery too. But other than that it was a great app :).",
        "Good idea, just doesn't work. Tried this out so I could check the charge state on my Huawei Watch while it is on the charger. Never showed the watch, even though it shows it was installed.",
        "Not mature enough for a paid app Not working reliably enough for my use. What would help is some detailed documentation about how it works. I have a wifi tablet that I want to monitor. It has multiple users and the wifi is switched off overnight. This wouldn't be uncommon. And whilst it does generally work that is possibly because someone will turn on the screen which seems to wake it up. But it shouldn't need the screen to be active - the purpose of the sw is to prevent people picking up the tablet and finding a dead battery. Also I am not receiving Chrome notifications. That could be at my end. But there is no assistance to help find out where to look inside Chrome.  However, it is worth a try to see if it works for your situation. But give it the full month to see if it is reliable. It wasn't for my purposes.  Only 2 stars. Based on the principle that if you pay for an app then it should come with detailed instructions and support.",
        "Does work some times It did work after installation by not anymore.",
        "Great app it, working just graet It was nice if the battery percentage will be showing in the extension icon instead of pressing it.",
        "Just installed in on 4 devices and it works like a charm. Unlike Potential which got all the fame."

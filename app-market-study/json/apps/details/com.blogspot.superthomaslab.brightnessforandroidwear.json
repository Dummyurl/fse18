        "Works great, except for a tiny bug. On Android Wear 2.0 if you open the app and close it out without adjusting the brightness setting, instead of leaving the setting at whatever level is shown, it turns the brightness down to a really low setting making it hard to see to turn the brightness back up.",
        "Simply Works!",
        "Not bad Not bad but didn't totally do what I wanted it to do... I wanted the screen to stay to the same dimness when the screen was in rest mode but instead it brightins back to the regular default minimum"

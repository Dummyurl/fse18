        "Works well but missing something It works on the Asus Smart watch 2 but a big thing missing is the ability to switch the temperature read out from degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.",
        "Works great.. Does what it says Nice way to  check basic information about your phone..  I wish there was a battery usage screen that showed estimated battery life left...",
        "Great but... Great app! However PLEASE fix the temperature. Here in the US we use farenhiet not Celsius. ONCE this is fixed and both parties can use the temp correctly then it will be 5 starts!",
        "Pretty good at what it does. Unfortunately, that doesn't include a breakdown of ram usage by process, which is the only thing I needed it for.",
        "Great App to Have For Geeks App works great. Gives system info that should be standard on Andriod Wear. Only reason i didn't give 5 stars was because temp is in Celsius not F.",
        "Once installed cannot uninstall it Not saying is a bad app. But once i ve install it I could not uninstall if from my watch. Had to factory reset it.."

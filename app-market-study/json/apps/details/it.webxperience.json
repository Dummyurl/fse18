        "Its not all too simple, but once you find out the working, it's simple. It is exactly like \"stock alarm\" except this lets your set your own music to the alarm:), since you listened last time, I was wondering can you add a dividend tracker to this app, plus also a display of the dividend in decimal  points $, not in percentages. üòÅ‚ò∫please, please would really help. plus if you can add a notification if a stock changes it's dividend. have never found an app to do that, so you would be breaking new grounds.ü§ûüôèthen it would be a 5 star app.",
        "Very well-designed app and all of the information I need is right up front and easy to read. I'm having trouble, though, finding after-hours quotes. I just started using it so I'll keep looking. EDIT: Thank you for your reply. I understand now why after-hour quotes are unavailable.",
        "Cool push notification feature",
        "Improvements needed: 1.the whole stock vs fund vs etf thing has good intentions but it really just makes everything more confusing than it needs to be, make the portfolios more seamless. 2. Add dividends to the total P/L of the stock/fund. 3. It's a pain the @$$ having to add stocks and funds separately each time under each portfolio. It's not easy to use and needs to become more seamless.  Other than these much needed improvements for the actual active investor, this app has potential.",
        "Thank you very much for this app. My request remains, that if you ever have that time, plz make this app for ios. That platform is really underdeveloped. Till then I am going to use it on my Android. Thanks again üôèüèΩ",
        "App stinks and very frustrating! A total waste of time trying to figure out how it works cause they make it difficult! It sucks!!!  Response: App didn't say \"watch Utube video\" to figure me out! And if I have to watch a Utube video to figure out your app, then my original review stands... It stinks!!!!"

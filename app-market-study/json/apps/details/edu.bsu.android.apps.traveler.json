        "Just too expensive. $70 to track my trip is not ok, when there is a free option available (location history on Google Maps). Pass.",
        "Decent app but could be slightly improved. For example, it had difficulty tracking my route and pictures when I went for a boat ride, even though the gps could locate my position within other apps. Still better than the other alternatives I looked at.",
        "Way too expensive",
        "I used this on a 4 week bike trip.  It was a great way to chronicle my trip.  And, I loved that i was able to share my \"adventures\" with my friends and family.  Developers are amazingly responsive to any issues and new ideas.  I have a few more trips plan this year and i will be using again.",
        "Free version. Looked good for a trial, but lost some tracks in travels through Asia due to them not saving on  then using Android back arrow/button. No way to undo or restore unles already exported to gpx/kml file. Disappointed."

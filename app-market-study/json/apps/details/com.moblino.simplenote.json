        "I found this one the best note app on Google play for Android Wear. Very good app, no ads at all, simple to use, quick as hell. I especially like that the Android Wear note is automatically stored, even if I reboot my watch and disconnect it from the phone. The only thing I miss: the app would be even better if I could store multiple notes on my watch!",
        "Finally! A useful app with no ads! It truly is simple, no frills, but does a very basic job well. Thanks!",
        "Simply simple!",
        "This is a terrible app. It said two times that it stopped and I losed all my hard work on there. This app is the worst. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS. It's gonna waste your time so don't."

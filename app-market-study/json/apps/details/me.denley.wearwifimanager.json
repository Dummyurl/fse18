        "Works great!                       I dropped my phone and its screen died. That day I made quite a bit of photos but I had wifi off on my phone and photos were set to backup on wifi only. Tried to enable wifi in blind (touch still worked) but to no avail.  Then I thought there must be an app for my watch to control phone wifi remotely. I went to Play Store on my laptop and I found this app pretty fast. A click and 5m later it was installed on my phone & wear.                         The app saved my photos! I've enabled wifi from my watch, and photos started backing up immediately!   Few tens of my photos from an one time event would be otherwise lost, as the damaged phone is encrypted.",
        "A bit useless Make it so I can connect to a wifi with my watch without needing to autenticate from phone, and it would become very handy.",
        "Will not work I have a Nexus 6p and a Huawei watch and I could not get this to work.",
        "Useless! It doesn't even work standalone.",
        "Would be great if it worked. Using huawei watch with Nexus 5x and hotspot toggle turns off wifi but doesn't turn on hotspot.",
        "Wifi toggle works, but hotspot toggle does not. Nexus 6P AOSPA + Huawei Watch."

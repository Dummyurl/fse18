        "I enjoy reading what others have to say about the places they check-in to. Be it positive or negative, curiosity can sometimes make you want to check out the place anyway! The \"taste\" feature is useful for more personal recommendations. I started using this app enjoying earning points and monitoring the leaderboard with my friends, but it became more exciting to share tips, help others, and know how much they appreciate the help you give. Adding \"tags\" made photo uploads slightly more interesting.  But lately, I don't get that much interaction so I don't know how to measure the impact of my reviews and photo uploads. And I've been getting some followers with mischievous profile descriptions. I hope this can be looked into.",
        "Have been a regular contributor for this app for years until recently when I changed to a new phone Samsung Note 8 and photos can't load into foursquare reviews anymore. Didn't have this problem with my Note 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.",
        "I had been using Foursquare for years and stopped in 2012 because they change the way the app used to be. Now I'm trying to play Foursquare again but still I don't have any idea what the app suppose to do.",
        "This app is my everywhere go , can't live without it .. but lately I noticed  when I search for example ''dinner'' it doesn't give more than 60 list ?!! Why is that ?  ..can you fix it please .. and always thank you so much for this app",
        "Very useful App to have in your phone. Saves you alot of time searching.",

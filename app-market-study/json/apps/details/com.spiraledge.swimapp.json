        "I was really excited to start using this off-season. I opened the app and creates my account, but it won't let my last name contain the word \"ecchi\" in it. My last name is Carnesecchi. I'm not going to change my last name, this is very aggravating",
        "Great idea. Needs sync with Samsung Health and Map My Run. So far it gets the distance correct most of the time, unlike Speedo On or S Health, but it does not always detect my strokes correctly (Samsung Gear Sport). I get freestyle or unknown. At least I can edit this on the website and in the app (took me a while to find out how). Also the app is very slow to load each section. Looking forward to updates.",
        "This app is great",
        "This app seems to not work with the new the misfit vapor or fossil q sport control. It requires you to press the only physical button and the watches already have prebuilt functions for it that make it impossible to use",

        "Thank you Kroger! I have been having issues with this app for a few weeks and have updated it several times with nothing fixed. I just updated the app and it's working beautifully! Love the app with the coupons and fuel points! Please chill out on the clock list promos, there isn't a Kroger that offers it within 50 miles of me so I couldn't care less. Thanks!",
        "Love the app & sure saves me money! Food,gift cards, clothing & gas savings are awesome. Would give it 5 stars but can not use Wi-Fi at local store as my security tells me it is unsafe. Even employees tell me they can not use for same reason? Duh please fix for 5 stars & a big Thank You!",
        "I love the Kroger app. I can download coupons so easily, and I can browse the weekly ad. Those are the main features I use, but it does a lot more. You can make grocery lists and order on Clicklist too. My one complaint is that one of the recent updates has caused the weekly ads to be cut off on the bottom. You can't see the bottom edge of the ad at all.",
        "The previous version I had worked good. I just updated at Google's suggestion and this version is lousy. It's slow. Takes several seconds for the page to change. It sometimes crashes. I wish I could go back to the previous version.",
        "Technical difficulties ... Technical difficulties ... Loved this app before the latest update broke it! Now it's useless! Another update and still can't clip coupons. Missed another free Friday coupon.",
        "I adore this app. I'm a list-lover, and the fact that I can keep track of what I usually buy, how often I'm buying certain things, AND manage my shopping list so easily is all kinds of win.  Plus, I love that the app defaults to adding things to my shopping list, unlike the Kroger website, which defaults to ClickList. Thank you for re-enforcing my already cult-like brand loyalty, Kroger. =)"

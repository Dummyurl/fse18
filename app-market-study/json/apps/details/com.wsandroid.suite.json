        "I have used McAfee Mobile Security free for for my phone for over 2 years now and am very satisfied. Notice it doesn't have a firewall like my PC Total Protection. Had to use another app. for firewall which allows  me to pick which continents I can block. This would be a great feature to be added to McAfee Mobile. Also noticed you can restore  contacts but nothing else. Instead of paying for Mobile it would also be great to combine with the  PC Total Protection. Love my McAfee products!",
        "I purchased McAFee Security Software for our family. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much security for the price I paid for the McAfee 10, which was at as a Prime Deal on Amazon & even though I had used McAfee before at a much smaller level, it wasn't anything special, if you know what I mean. Man, was & have I been totally shocked. McAfee is unbelievable how it protects our family. Excellent purchase on my part!!",
        "I like it but using so much ram memory This apps using a lot memory make my budget 1gb ram phone slow and lag. I really like that concept shows my phone performance on right screen this should be every 7 minutes to tell your phone performances.              Thanks. Regards, Sam",
        "This app is great at protecting all of my devices with the exception of my huawei mate 10 pro... As it keeps switching McAfee security off not sure why this is?UPDATE 25/2/18 problem seems to have resolved by deleting a duplicate network provider app thanks for the response McAfee",
        "Bells and whistles,ahh,no.that's for kids! 100 percent detection of newest and oldest viruses by AV-Test?...YES. McAfee keeps me from having to buy a new phone and keeps me safe on the web. One of the very best in the security business  and they are known for it...I NEVER HAVE TO WORRY WITH McAfee. They are only rated low because of people wrongly wanting fluff instead of realizing this is TOP SECURITY. PUT McAfee on your phone and play and go to sleep with peace!",
        "Was a great product for a smartphone. The latest updates now don't allow anything to be done other than optimise all. Other options are still available but you can't access them. This is on annual Xperia and same issue on Samsung S7. Please fix!"

        "AQ STUDIO=depth and love in their wear games. Brilliant puzzle/maze game with full features. Has one annoying bug though....sometimes when you swipe in a direction to move it interferes with wears op and exits the game. Needs option to tap screen edges to move in that direction. Biggest puzzle is why is there an rpg world going on in all the backgrounds? Is this a fund raiser for something bigger?",
        "Great port Love the work that went into this game and the port. It's a stunning little game on my watch. One thing, is Easy Level 12 possible or is there a bug? Can't figure it out.",
        "An excellent game, very impressed. The swipe controls don't appear to work 100% of the time, but the tap ones do. Love the graphics, and the stuff going on in the background.",
        "Nice! Works well on wear, simple style and gameplay, only thing I'd like to see (if possible) would be some way to save progress between switching phones or factory resets... instead of starting over from zilch each time.",
        "No option to refund app",
        "Meh... As far as the selection goes for Wear this is good.  In reality, its glitchy and recycles rpg maker skins.  Moto 360 with s4."

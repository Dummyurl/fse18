        "It works and looks great but... Installed on LG G Watch R and works fine, but it doesn't appear that you can get a new answer by turning the watch over and then back. Really, that seems like it should be the default way to make it work. A simple tap is easier, but not nearly as authentic.   While I'm complaining, it would be great if users could create their own list of answers on the phone app.  I'm not sure I could ever give an app like this 5 stars but I'll give one additional star if each of my suggestions are implemented. (#BRIBERY)",
        "My slef of steam :( I asked if I was fat and it said of course silly! You also have to follow me on twitter, the ball said you would",
        "Thay hating but that broke the disrespect. My life that's o noshow I got liquor bye the bolo",
        "WHEN I SAID THAT CAN I HAVE A XBOX AND MINCRAFT GAME IT SAID HELL YES JUST WEIRD I â™¥ THIS GAME!",
        "Lol I asked like 21x if the app was fake and it said yes. Every time I ask a question it always says yes or positive.",
        "Fun app but needs voice activation App works well on both Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Gear Live, but is there a way to start the app on the wearable with voice activation? Something like, \"Ok Google...start 8 ball\" would make the app much more useful and fun."

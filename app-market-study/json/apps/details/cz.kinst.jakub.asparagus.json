        "Best recipe app on Android or any platform once. It's easily in many ways the prettiest, simplest, most usable, and best recipe collection app on Android, and I would argue on iOS, too, actually! (Despite it not being on iOS, sadly. But nothing on iOS compares to it.) UPDATE(02/2016):Still fantastic but hasn't been updated in a very long time. No longer syncs properly. Lost a bunch of recipes. No developer response. Wouldn't install anymore, sadly.",
        "Aesthetically Brilliant! Needs a Chrome extension and app! The beautiful Material Design aesthetic is a wondrous delight! The functionality of adding recipes via the Android Chrome browser is simple, intuitive, and flawless. There could be an easier way to delete recipes without having to open the recipe and then remove it, but that is only a minor inconvenience. The only drawback is that you must use an Android Chrome browser to add recipes as there is no extension in the Chrome webstore for use on a computer. A chrome extension would greatly increase the appeal of this app and a broader audience would be able to share/save their recipes to the app. A Chrome app would also be a large boost as the recipes could then be accessed online from any chrome browser!",
        "Doesn't work that well Beautiful, smooth interface, and I love being able to import recipes directly from Chrome. Too bad it doesn't work 90% of the time. It worked great for the first few recipes I imported, but hasn't ever worked since then. Marking down further for not being able to put recipes in multiple folders, and for not being able to access them from my PC (if I have to type recipes in manually I'd rather have a real keyboard)",
        "Needs More to Compete Interface is decent but needs more features / functionality to compete with my current favorite recipe app (Pepperplate). Importing from recipe sites is extremely limited and recipes should be allowed to be in more than one folder/category for starters. Unless there's some other *unique* feature that gets added down the road, I don't really see myself using this for very long.",
        "Really great I've tried several recipe apps, and this is by far my favorite.   There are a couple of issues, as it doesn't import all recipes that I try to add by browser, and if it does import, at times it doesn't import all of the information. Recipes are easy to add , so the issues aren't a hindrance for me, but it would be nice if it were fixed. It would also be fantastic if there was a Chrome app, so i can add from my computer.",
        "Developer never responded I really loved the ease of this app and is beautiful and user friendly. I hate that it won't clip recipes from all sites. There are many recipes that I can save to Evernote and pocket but not here. Fix and I will give 5 stars. I emailed the developer well over a week ago regarding the inability to save all of my recipes and no one has bothered to  respond. I wanted one pace for all of my recipes but this isn't it. Uninstalling."

        "Team battles I love the game but you guys should also add coop missions too that would be cool and more with the pvp like 2v2 3v3 4v4 and so on and fun events like multiplayver boss battles on the dailey and arena rewards and the rewards to be an amount of crystals and the top 10 get like $10 worth to $50 worth",
        "Loved the game, played for several hours and when I went to log back in, I'd lost all the progress I had made.. seems like other people are having this issue and nothing is being done. So 1 star until the developer starts showing they care.",
        "Would give it a better rating but... Every time I try to play the first level on the second planet it just closes out of the app. I've restarted my phone and reinstalled the app like 9 TIMES and it still won't work. Please fix thank you.",
        "Lost data I was getting into it until it deleted my data and stats after less than one freaking day of playing. Srsly if there's nothing I can do about this then someone needs to get their crap together please bc this seems like a fun game. I already some money to get started too.",
        "Crashes The game keeps crashing randomly every few minutes and its freaking annoying.  Please fix the random crash bug. Apart from that it's an excellent game.  If you fix the crash bug I'll rate it 5 stars",
        "Saved Game Constantly Lost Alright game except the annoying reset that keeps happening. Had to redo planet 2 like 8 times before finally able to move onto 3rd"

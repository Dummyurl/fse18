        "Accuracy looks to be high but it does take a long time to read fully, over 2 minutes average. Not sure if this is because I have arterial fibulation or inherent in the app. Using Samsung S8 running 8.0",
        "Works great for galaxy s8 plus!  I did it 3 times to be sure I get a close number which 3 times the numbers were one percent off each time now my fingers are small so takes a while for me to position it perfectly over the scanner and plus I am fidgety so hard for me to stay still but so far so good!",
        "Great app.  Tried others but this one gives out best rhythm and accurate heartbeat.  It's nice to document certain readings throughout the day to help see consistency or abnormalities",
        "Better hope you have all week to do a reading... Takes forever and isn't accurate.. Said my heart rate was 130 sitting still when it was barely 60",
        "Not sure if it's because of my phone (Galaxy Prime Plus) or what but finger burns when getting HR. Probably the phone's flash but app may be utilizing flash on its brightest.",
        "This has so far been the most reliable HR monitor I have used with my wear watch. However, there are a few things that prevent me from giving it more stars. 1:  It places an alarm status in the status bar. This drove me nuts!  I couldn't figure out why I had an alarm when I hadn't set one in the clock app. I finally figured out that it was HRP because I had it set to read automatically from my watch every 15 mins. 2:  Since I'm using my wearable to take readings, I don't require the use of the camera for them. But, when I launch the app (to look at the history) it want to take a reading with the camera. Thus the LED lights up. It would be nice to have a toggle.  EDIT:  There IS an option in the latest version to open the app in history. 3:  Finally, I'd like to see more history than the last 7 readings. Perhaps daily, weekly, monthly charts. Other than these slight personal issues, this has been by far the most reliable heart rate monitor I've used with my wearable. Hoping to.see.some improvements with future releases.  EDIT 3/2/18:  Appears ALL my concerns have been addressed. 5 stars and thank you!"

        "This app is very helpful and has everything needed just like going online. The only problem is that  there is no multiple logins to access more than one account. I cannot see the fingerprint sign in option on the app. My phone has a fingerprint sensor running the latest software version",
        "Takes way too long to process a simple deposit. Also you should not have to write a resume on the back of your check to make a deposit. It's bad enough that you have to put a signature and your specific account number. When it comes to for deposit only, date, yada yada yada gets a little ridiculous...",
        "Even after enabling fingerprint login it always ask for my member ID and password and also I enabled quick balance still I got to register the device always!! Worst app!!",
        "I am using OxygenOS Version 4.5.14 on OnePlus 5, this app does not allow to login, it keep saying \"Authentication Error, An unspecified system error has occurred\" However I can login with other android OS with same credentials.  Need help on this",
        "I absolutely LOVE this app. I have a car payment and set up people pay. U can do it from the app instead of having to do it online. Never had any issues. I LOVE the way dcu is taking this digital first option. I recommend dcu to everyone. Screw banks. Credit unions are where it's at!",
        "The app sucks. Checking the recurring payments is tough. There is no direct link to check my auto loan payment. Very poorly designed!"

        "I really like this app. But, it has stopped working.  It works on the phone, but the watch doesn't bring up the verses anymore.  Edit... Accessing on the watch is spotty.  Sometimes the verses come and sometimes they don't.  I'm keeping it, but I certainly wouldn't pay for it until the issue gets fixed.",

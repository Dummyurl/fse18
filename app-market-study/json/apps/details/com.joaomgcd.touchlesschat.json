        "Good app, but got an app-breaking bug. Basically I got to the screen where I need to choose using Google Voice or not. I can't press next if I don't choose Google Voice, but I'm outside US/Canada.  Also, when I press next after selecting \"use google voice\" the app will crash and I have to redo the tutorial again (still same error). Can't even enter the main app. The voice command \"send whatsapp ...\" is somehow working, but I keep randomly getting the sample popup on setup/tutorial that I have to swipe. If the issue is fixed, it will be an easy 5/5",

        "hi Joao, is there a way to change te default language other than doing it manually one by one?",
        "So, the app as a concept is great. I can't speak much for any features but Tasker integration, and it works wonderfully with WhatsApp.  However, in Android oreo, this app is obliterating my battery. It accounts for over 30% of my total usage, even though it literally runs through Tasker only once a day in the morning to send 2 messages. I'm not sure what's going, and I hope this gets fixed soon so I can change my review.",

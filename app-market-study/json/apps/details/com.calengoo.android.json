        "Excellent calendar app! Have used CalenGoo since 2013 to manage my total life. My database goes back to 2004 from Palm/Outlook. Local calendar and ics file backup works perfectly. My first and only problem surfaced in 2018 on transition to new android 7.0 phone. Developer diligently worked and quickly solved problem. Much more flexibility in this app than I can ever use. 5+ stars",
        "Best Calendar app by far, very customizable, used it for years and never had a single issue, just gets better with every update. The first thing I install on every new device. Excellent",
        "I've tried several other apps for calendaring to keep my personal and work diaries separate. This is the only one I've got so far that has stayed updated, which handles multiple time zones well as I fly between regions, and that let's me cleanly manage my own tasks. Dev, love the work, thank you!",
        "Super customisable.  Absolutely no issues so far.",
        "If all programmers built apps as beautiful as this one, the world would be a better place. You may initially find it confusing to customize, but that's because there are so many amazing options. Be patient.",
        "I cannot live without this app. It is super intimidating to configure but once done is heavenly to use. Has everything I could ever ask for"
    ],
    "recentChanges": [
        "- Added support for HTML formatting in the description of events.",
        "- Added support for keywords, i.e. events that contain certain words can automatically be displayed with a certain color or icon (\"Settings > Display and Use > General > Keywords\").",
        "- Better support for WhatsApp, Skype, Hangouts, Waze, SBB Mobile (\"Settings > Display and Use > Detail view\").",
        "- When entering the location of an event you can now select a contact and use its address."

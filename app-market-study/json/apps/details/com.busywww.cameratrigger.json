        "On app start there is an error message: \"unknown issue with play services\" and it does not take pictures or make video clips on trigger. Rooted xperia z1.  Edit: On shield tablet k1 it is not possible to set a folder hence no pictures are saved.",
        "Simply doesn't work. It takes a picture so slowly that the object has left the frame!",
        "Pathetic app... Nothing worked. Time waste.",
        "With this app, you can set it to record a short video when it detects movement... And it works! Every other app i tried failed at this task. Thank you...",
        "Video is nonsense. I have had three different gones where battery swelled from motion detection and overheating.  Master the still image remote viewing,then move on.  Stability, battery,and data squeeze",
        "App is not taking videos.  Only pictures. A copy 3 years ago does the job."

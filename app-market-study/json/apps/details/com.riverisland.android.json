        "Basket plays up. Currently check out is not in use, items won't leave the basket if you decide you no longer want them. Usually a good app, but when the basket & check-out plays up it's useless. Could do with a refresh button. Needs updating to fix bugs more than every 4/5 months",
        "Rubbish. Nothing loads and always freezes",
        "Displays incorrect information such as delivery date and no email to contact other than social media pages",
        "App is worse than useless. You'd think River island would want you to buy their products yet the checkout does not work. Cannot remove items from the basket (quantity goes into minus) and the prices are added up wrong. Appalling",
        "Terrible. Wont let me pay with gift vouchers or with direct debit.",
        "Honestly this app would be excellent if you would show whether discount codes worked before you go through the entire 5 step check out process. This really let's it down."

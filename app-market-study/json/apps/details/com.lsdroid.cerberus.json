    "description": "Cerberus is a complete anti-theft application, the best protection you can get to recover your misplaced, lost or stolen Android device. It's not just a \"find my phone\" app or a phone tracker, Cerberus has many unique features that make it the perfect app to locate your phone or tablet, identify the thief and get back your device.Install Cerberus and try it for free for one week, then you can buy a license for your account from within the app or from the web dashboard.It has three ways to protect your device. These are the \"3 heads\" of Cerberus:- Remote control through the website https://www.cerberusapp.com- Remote control via SMS (text messages) from another phone- Automatic alertsThis app uses the Device Administrator permission.REMOTE CONTROLRemote control allows you to perform many operations on your lost or stolen device, like:- Locate and track it- Lock the device with a code- Start a loud alarm, even if the device is set to silent mode- Display a message that stays on the screen, and also make your device speak the message- Take pictures, screenshots and even record videos, to identify the thief- Get the location history, to see where the device has been in the past- Wipe the internal memory and the SD card, to protect your personal data- Hide Cerberus from the app drawer, so the app will be stealthy and a thief will not see the icon- Record audio from the microphone- Get a list of last calls sent and received- Get information about cell phone network and WiFi network the device is connected to, and nearby WiFi networks- Start a remote shell (SSH-like), to execute commands as if the device were connected to your computer with a USB cable- And much more!AUTOMATIC ALERTSCerberus can automatically perform actions when some conditions are met. For instance, it will send email/SMS alerts if the SIM card is changed (see the \"SIM checker\" section of the settings) and it will email you a photo of the thief when a wrong unlock code is entered (section \"Automatic photo capture\").You can also set your own rules, see the \"AutoTask\" section! From there you can set geofencing (alerts when the phone exits or enters an area) and a lot of more automatic actions and alerts.ADVANCED FEATURESFrom within the app configuration, you can enable some options to make difficult for the thief to disable or uninstall Cerberus. Make sure to enable the \"Device Administration\" functionality and the \"Protect device admin\" option. Also you can block the Power Menu to prevent the thief from shutting down the device, and block access to the status bar in the lock screen, so nobody would be able to change the quick settings in Lollipop (Android 5.0) and later versions.If you have rooted your device you can install Cerberus as a system application and get many additional features, including complete uninstall protection (Cerberus will survive a factory reset) and GPS auto-enabling when you start tracking the device. See the Help page on our website for more information on that.The app works even if the device does not have an internet connection thanks to remote control by sms messages. Also, the SIM Checker feature allows you to know the new number to send texts to, if the SIM card is changed.If you have an Android Wear smartwatch, make sure to check the \"Wearable device\" section of the app settings: you will find many useful and cool features.Please read the Help page on our website (https://www.cerberusapp.com/help.php), it has the answers to the most frequently asked questions. If you have any questions not covered there, feature requests or experience any issues, contact us at support@cerberusapp.com and we will be happy to help!",

        "Pricing model is screwed up. €5 for one device, no tier for two, €15 for three. I have two devices and was expected to pay €7.50 each. Yeah, fat chance. Way to use your own pricing against yourself,  Greedo.",
        "Got an email from the Cerberus devs recently stating how Cerberus uses a subscription model, however as a legacy user on an old lifetime purchase, they've confirmed they will continue to honour that lifetime licence.  Well done Cerberus for doing the right thing!  👍",
        "I dropped my rating WAY down, and here's why: I got a license for 5 devices, enough for me, the wife and our two adult kids. However, there is a critical flaw... everyone whose device is registered under the same account has to use the same login credentials. And anyone on the account can see where everyone else is, at any given time. There is NO WAY our adult kids will sign onto this, knowing that Mom & Dad could log in and know their whereabouts 24/7!  I contacted the company and let them know that this is a show-stopper for us; that they need to add users by EMAIL ADDRESS and then by their unique DEVICES. That way, everyone would have their own login credentials. Until that happens, though, Cerberus and Persona are not under consideration for us.",
        "The ads make the app difficult to use when opening from the web on a phone. I paid for this app so I'm not sure why all the ads all of a sudden. Before the ads: *****  Now: **",
        "Forgot password, app doesnt send email. Doesnt send emails for pictures taken with wrong unlock code either. When trying to deactivate it blinks screen with lorem ipsum text and doesnt get deactivated. Somethimes the quick buttons menu pops down somethimes not. Conclusion is the app is broken atm.",
        "The best phone tracking app out there. Well worth the money, better get it now than regret not having it later!"

        "I want to delete select SMS with Tasker. This plugin can read the %smsid, but it cannot delete any sms. I'm rooted, and it says to Grant \"App Opps\", but that is too vague, I have no idea what \"App Opps\" refers to. I'm sadly disappointed because I need a way to delete SMS spam from \"no number\" spammers. Samsung Galaxy S5, Android 6.01 Marshmallow",
        "Definitely a good addition to tasker This one is worth grabbing for those custom security and sms. Thanks, this a well needed plug in.",
        "Doesn't work for me - always returns 1000 for process",
        "Good app But need update to fix inviald %smsid",
        "I guess this is useful to only a limited audiance",

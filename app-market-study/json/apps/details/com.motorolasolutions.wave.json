        "Overall a useful app. Lost 2 key functions from prior versions: 1) can't replay old messages 2) won't auto sign in",
        "Confused Not able use guide to use the apk",
        "Great Improvement Would it be possible in the future to have the channel that is receiving audio to either change color or have an icon appear to let the user know what channel was just active?  This would help in situations where a user is monitoring multiple channels.",
        "Works great!",
        "New version is awesome Much easier to navigate i feel, would be nice to be able to replay messages, our business environment is quite noisy and we can't use Bluetooth devices",
        "The old version is way better! You need to enter a password every time you log in. Does NOT remember you. Also,  everytime someone else keys up their Mic, you hear their  annoying \"PTT beep\".  Highly annoying.  I removed and reinstalled the old version.  Old version is really good,  no complaints."

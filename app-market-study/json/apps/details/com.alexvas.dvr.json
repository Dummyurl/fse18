        "Tried this app but for me it is not very good. It has no support for my DVR's. It will connect but only show the first channel. Tried changing channels but does nothing. There is no DVR support at all e.g. remote playback, veiw logs or alarms, change DVR settings. My cams also have 2 streams a low bitrate as well as a high bitrate. When using my 4g data i would prefer to use the low bitrate steam as not to use to much data and keep the stream smooth, there is no option for this it will only connect to the high bitrate stream. I will have to keep using the XMEye app as this does have DVR support. This tinyCam app seems to be only good for connecting directly to IP cams only.",
        "Allows you to bypass p2p & use your  static IP.  I like this app for the above fact. As the IP camera manufacturers p2p servers are all slow & unreliable.  With this app I can connect to my Tenvis IP camera via port forwarding  every time.  I would consider buying the pro version but that does not allow you to view or download video that's recorded on the remote camera.  I do not wish to record on to my phone via network as video is recorded, saved and overwritten on the remote camera.",
        "so I wanted to connect for my other phone, but this app has like 5 cameras preset. why? noone downloads an ip camera watcher without having a can to watch or having an idea what he wants to watch. it works with the preset cameras good enough, no patience to delete them one by one(could not find out how)",
        "I used to really rate this app. It was lean and did what it did really well and I had it for years. With the same cameras it won't display the feeds when you launch the app. I have to go into each camera by clicking edit and hit test. This clearly works and then brings up an image. I have to do that for minimum 1 but usually for both cameras which makes this a pain to use. I've now switched to OWLR which does what this used to do - display both cameras as soon as you open the app. If I use tinycam, the activity I want to see will have long gone which renders it pretty much useless. Giving 2 stars given the previous good history with this app.",
        "Works ok but CONSTANT ads that keep on changing.  Nice that it works without needing admin permissions.  Did I mention there are CONSTANT ads, VERY irritating.  Too much to put up with.",
        "It's to damn complicated to use this app... ðŸ‘Ž That's why I'm using ALFRED app. You just have to install two apps, and it's way easier to use..."

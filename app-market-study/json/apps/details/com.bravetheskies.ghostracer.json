        "Won't install on Sony SmartWatch 3 (from Oneplus 5T).",
        "There's no better running app for android wear. Yes, the learning curve might be a bit high but once you've got it working like you want it's the best. Activities can be uploaded to Strava which in turn syncs with Google Fit. So much better than the Strava AW app with support for a whole load of sensors. Keep up the good work!",
        "I needed an app to track my cycling and running via standalone GPS on my Sony smartwatch and in my opinion Ghost Racer is the best. I tried a few other apps, some drained the battery, in others it was difficult to choose the activity from the watch itself (needed the phone to do that). But all of this was not a problem with Ghost Racer. I love this app.",
        "This is highly rated by some users outside of play store, so thought would look at it. Very basic as only activities are running and cycling. Also no link to Google Fit or Runtastic",
        "This app has been very unreliable for me. I tried it 4 times and it repeatedly stopped recording during the ride, losing ride data and restarting recording by itself.. This was while paired to a Wahoo RFLKT, which is itself barely alpha in production quality, so wouldn't surprise me if the Wahoo API is involved in this.",
        "I imagine that this is fantastic, but it doesn't show on my Sony smart watch 3. Please help.  It works fantastic now it's installed! Thanks it's fab on my Sony smart watch ðŸ˜ƒ"

        "A great functioning novilty app! Since my friends and I get hungry often, pizza is always on the menu. At any time, I can bring up this app and find the nearest pizzaria, wherever I can get cell and GPS service!",
        "Amazing! Was planning on buying pizza for my wife's graduation party from a pre determined place when we found out day of that they were closed. Fired up this app on my Moto 360 and found the closest pizza place. Ended up buying from them and the pizza was great! Thanks, Pizza Navigator for saving my wife's grad party!",
        "how to add new places? Looks good and can find most of the pizza places, what is the databse for this and how can we add more?  Edit: Would be good to advertise that it goes off Google API.  I would also suggest you use foursquare API",
        "Beautiful I don't know how I lived before this app. EDIT: Kms were available I was an idiot, thanks for the fastest reply!",
        "Won't appear on Android Watch I bought this mostly for the novelty of a pizza thing on my watch, pointing me to pizza, but the app isn't showing up on my LG watch. What's the deal?",
        "Good stuff Simple app, does what it says, implemented my suggestion of blacklisting certain pizza places. love it"

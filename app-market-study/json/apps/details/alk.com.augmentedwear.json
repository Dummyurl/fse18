Augmented Wear fills this gap.Note Augmented Wear is also a companion app to Augmented SmartWatch Pro for additional use cases:1) Full custom alert notification system to show text or text/image alerts + with Smart Haptics + Animation2) Alerts that have a sender with a contact picture will be shown using Augmented Wear (if installed and the optimize for Sender Pictures is enabled). These alerts will be shown in two screen updates (image of the sender alert and the text of the alert). The color and size of the text can also be customized.3) Wear Battery life is shown in some background images4) Vibrate only mode possible (must use custom alerts).5) Battery Drain Threshold - to show alerts if battery drain exceeds this threshold.6) Google Now Alerts will use the full screen image alert (if traffic cameras are enabled)7) North America - can show closest traffic camera by tapping on icon/alert on Wear. A compass overlay is also shown to indicate the direction of the location of the camera.8) Auto predicted next traffic camera in your predicted direction of travel - (Augmented Traffic Views on a watch)9) Custom SMS responsesHowever you do not need Augmented SmartWatch Pro to use this free app for the vibrations on disconnect feature or to use the Intent API above.Augmented SmartWatch Pro and Augmented Wear is a powerful combination for your Android Wear SmartWatchMore info here: http://bit.ly/1sDPYBF",

        "Nice, but the main screen always turns on after the edge info is displayed. I'd purchase the Pro version if  the main screen didn't light up after the edge screen does.  I do realize that this is an api issue.  Wish there was a workaround. :( Great app otherwise! Thanks!",

        "Too Much Information I keep going back to this app every couple of months and just end up deleting it because it's just too complicated."

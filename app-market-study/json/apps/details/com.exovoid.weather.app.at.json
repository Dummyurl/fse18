        "I've been using this app for a week or so in a relatively basic way and I really like it. The interface is pleasant and the information quite detailed. The only thing I don't like is that the notifications are not always synchronized with the rest of the app: right now my notification says \"partly cloudy\" while the main app says \"clear\". (For the record, there isn't a cloud in the sky)",

        "I love it. I've tried different weather apps, but this one is best and most accurate. Especially I love hourly review. When he says that it'll rain at 14 o'clock I can trust him, because usually it really rains :) I like design very much too.",
        "Most accurate weather app i have used so far! Very good hourly preview! Give it a shot ;)"

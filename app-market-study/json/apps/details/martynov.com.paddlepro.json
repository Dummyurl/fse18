        "Keen I only looked for something like this so I can be like commander keen during his off hours lol I love this if only it was in phosphorus green then it would get five stars",
        "Never connected Lg g watch (without r) just never opens sicks uninstall this",
        "Good game It's a fun game for when I'm bored I would give it 5 stars but on android wear it's too fast and I lose easily",
        "Fun time waster. Would like it to only start once you pick up the paddle.",
        "Great! But.. I would have given 5 stars but it would be nice to have an option in the settings to adjust for a round style watch.",
        "It's very entertaining! It works great on my LG G watch!  Great little game to pass time."

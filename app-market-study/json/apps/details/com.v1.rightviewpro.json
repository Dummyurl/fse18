        "App not working well on S7. When you hit record they're is about a 7 second delay before it actually starts recording. Not good in a game situation when you are trying to get video of a swing etc",
        "Won't open videos Imported video, trimmed video saved as new file , & I'm still not open",
        "Easiest app for breaking down pitching and hitting! Tool",
        "Clunky and poorly designed and a rip off too Update: after the update it now tells me my free version has expired! After I paid for an in app purchase. Stay away from this app. Stay far away! Poor interface including references to a golf app that this must be based on. Expect more than this. Does not deliver on in app purchases either. I paid for 3 models and it only lets me download one.",

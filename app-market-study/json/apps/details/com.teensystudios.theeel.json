        "Fun Maybe add a snake rather than a worm, so like a alternative skin pack.  Also, maybe add a way so you can tap instead of swipe.  I also noticed that if you make a quick 180, you die. Great app and graphics.",
        "Ok but Works ok but have to turn screen of to exit and seems a bit clunky on Sony sw3",
        "Great I enjoy this game.",
        "Wish it worked... Game doesn't even launch on my Gear Live... screen just goes black and it never loads. Fix this, and I'll fix the rating.",
        "Flashback! Nice game! Retro fun! Enjoying this quick blast from the past. Good work people. Any chance of some more modes?"

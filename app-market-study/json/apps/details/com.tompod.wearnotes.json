        "Would be a great app if we could store the notes. Since they disappear with a swipe, I can't use this app to send a note about anything important. Since I would only send notes about important things, my conclusion is: the app is its current state is useless. Why would I send a note about anything unimportant? And why would I risk of losing an important note? In my opinion storing function for notes is essential.",

        "using the Sony Smartwatch3 and Nexus 6p - the only toggles that synched correctly were the Wifi, orientation and Volume controls; Location did not create any response and the flashlight toggle removed and added  the options from the controls on my phone, but did not swithc on/off. Also, I'm aware that google prohibits mobile data toggles, but this is still dissappointing",
        "Toggle for hotspot is really one I want A few of the toggles are already available from the watch. Would be good if we could configure the toggle list bit hotspot toggle is really what I want.",
        "Nearly perfect. There are a few toggle Apps for Wear and this is the best. Just lacks phone network status and signal strength - would then be five stars.",
        "Best one so far Really easy to use, it really works although l would love if they could add the Hotspot turn on function",
        "I Uninstalled the app on my phone but it's still on my watch (huawei)",

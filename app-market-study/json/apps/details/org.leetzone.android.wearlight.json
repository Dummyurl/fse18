        "Works great if you can read the description Another review called this a scam. I can't see where the scam is. The app is free and doesn't do anything shady. If you can't or don't want to use it, then uninstall. Reviews like that discourage people from developing apps. Not everything is a 5. Save the 1's for apps that do evil stuff or are nothing but ads and unusable.",

        "Best app ever Does exactly what it says on the box. Really great UI and user experience, absolutely stunning work by the developer. At this point I believe he/she is a close relative of Tony Stark with this level of code, looks like the work of Jarvis.",
        "This is the best tap to count app for Android Wear I found! Full screen tap is a great idea! But please add a minus function too (for example double tap).",
        "Perfect Perfect for counting things! I can never remember what swing I'm on while playing golf, and this is absolutely perfect for it.",
        "Plz make a mode to turn off vibrations",
        "/r/androidwear brought me here And it's great! Would be cool to have multipliers and a way to decrease",
        "Simple and effective A great little app. Simple to use, just tap and it counts."

        "Doesn't work anymore... Hasn't been working for the past 2 days. You also got rid of the settings option for some reason? All I can access is licences",
        "Great fun It's great fun to use this app. The \"sound quality\" of the farts are the \"best\" I've heard in an app!",
        "The reason you have a smart watch. A nice little feature is the custom sounds.  I uploaded an air horn sound and now everyone thinks I'm a DJ.",

        "Amazing The best reason to own a smart watch. Excellent for terrorising the mother in law."

        "Fantastic! Innovative! Well thought out! I really 'felt' the 'spin' on this app. What a cracker! Its such a welcome 'break' from usual 8 Balll Pool umpiring apps. Others just didn't think of all the requirements but this developer has really listened to every single 'tip'. He must have been in a great 'frame' of mind when writing it.",
        "Easilly the best timer I've used. I love that i don't have to look at the phone after every shot or watch the phone when time is getting close.  However a more convenient way to pause the clock would be better. Maybe touch and holding with haptic feedback so the umpire does not have to look away from table. Well done.",

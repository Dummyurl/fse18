        "Stopped working Amazing concept. Seemed to work at first. But now I keep getting the message \"unable to run sms\". I set it to seems sms when I choose the action on my moto 360, but every time I select, I get an error message. Update - lowered my rating further, because it's completely disfunctional, and with all the attempts I made, there is no one to talk to.",
        "Simple, does the job, pleasing phone app interface. Well done dev! (One quick suggestion: consider an icon change? Almost passed this over as it looked like another watch face at first glance.)",
        "Cant do tasker App does not have tasker permission",
        "Good! Nice and simple to work out. Needs waaaaay more actions though for it to be of more use.",
        "AWESOME APP!!! I was looking all over google play for a android wear phone control app and this one is perfect!!!",
        "Very Good :)"

        "Welp they killed it. This was my favorite app, worth every penny. Now since the last update it takes forever to open, is slow to load, and they got rid of the thunderforest maps. I had it downloaded for my area and relied on that everyday for my work, then all of the sudden I go to pull up the app and it's gone. If something isn't broke, don't try to fix it.",
        "Awesome app and support. Have been using it for hunting after my GPS broke about 3 years ago! Highly recommend!!",
        "Great app.",
        "I totally love this app. I am a hunter and use it often while in the woods to find my way out whenever I am not paying attention and don't recall my exact tracks, or simply when I am hiking. There is one feature that at least in my opinion would make this app COMPLETE, and earn 5 stars status from me; I wish I could track my other friends/hunters in our group as we move around while hunting/hiking, of course we all have this app in our phones. That would be the pinnacle of this great app. That to me/us is very important, and my friends and I all agree that with that feature we could move more freely around knowing the we all know where the others are at. Come on BCN, you can do this!!!!  :) Update: 2/13/18: So BCN, when will you come out with your own gps device and teach GARMIN how's done????",
        "I really like this app but it sometimes crashes when recording a track, so I need to keep an eye on it. Other than that though, it's awesome.",
        "Spent 4 days in the Canadian Rockies and before I left, I downloaded various maps at various zoom levels. We even managed to find a couple Geocaching spots to within a couple feet! Canadian Topo maps are detailed & very accurate. Other maps are handy and accurate too."

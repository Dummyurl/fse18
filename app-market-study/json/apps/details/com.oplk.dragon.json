        "The camera view will not load most of the time  when away from home.  Then if it does it only certain cameras always at least one that doesn't  load just keeps spinning.  Very upsetting when motion deteted goes off and you can't  see why. Takes at least a minute to a minute and a half for the movement to show after detection goes off.  Very dissapointed  in sytem",
        "Last update 1/18  really slow uploading cameras",
        "Great customer service!! Solid app!! They released a fix for a bug I noticed within 3 days. Great startup company, solid HD cameras, easy to install!! IFTTT integration is working flawlessly!!",
        "No symbols allowed in password? In 2017?! In a security product?!?!",
        "So this app would normally be 4+ stars. But lately, it been saying that the system is offline, when it's not. I can turn the sound on for a camera, call the phone, and I hear it ringing. Video is also there. But the app says the system is offline? I try restarting the OPU (remotely) nothing changes. Of course not, because it's \"offline\". Need an update to fix this. Otherwise love this system on a budget. SERIOUSLY!  FIX the false OFFLINE status! I can't do anything but view video when this bug occurs (which is probably once/week lately)",
        "Needs an update for Alexa! I like the system but cuatomer service via email stinks! Developer's please create an update.  Alexa says she is having trouble accessing the skill."

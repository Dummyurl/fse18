        "Great sound period not hard to use. Like that equaliser fix the sound the way I like it. No cut outs either with your music mp3 player app. But I have a question how is it that you show a song on the list to be played thus when trying to play it my phone declines by showing ( file not supported) even though it shows on the app that I download from.",
        "I haven't used all the features yet. The UI is great very easy to use!! I love the driving mode, almost thought I was going to blow up my amp or subwoofer but they are ok. I t still think this is a superb",
        "It is really really good, easy to download music. Also! Although was confused at first, I got the hang of it and then I didn't have to buy the app in order to listen offline! I absolutely loved this app, and I'm sure you would too!",
        "Very good! You can see all your songs, or your playlists, or play whole folders, and you can see what's currently enqueued! Also a dark theme and equalizer. I can't understand why other music players (looking at you, Google Play!) can't have all this basic functionality.",
        "Its good but when you save a playlist and the app gets updated its all gone. You have to do it every single time. Other wise its kinda best but the playlist problem let me down and amde me switch a different player!",
        "I just downloaded this' so I haven't used it to know how good it is. It seems that the sound quality is the best from all my previous apps. But I have only listened to one song so far."

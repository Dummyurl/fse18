        "Need instructions for changing cams I use a LG watch GR but cannot get this app to change cams?  How, swiping does nothing.  Nice app, just needs some instructions or better working with different devices. Any help?",
        "Works fine Thanks. But can it support https?  For security reason, I get the snapshots from cam and put them on a web server instead of allowing direct Internet access to cam. It will be great if https can work for hiding the path when I am using public WiFi.",
        "Please load some basic instructed videos on youtube for how to setup ? I am using wifi cam via android phone. Stock app works fine. Only issue with your app on android wear.",
        "Like it but freezes I love this but it keeps freezing on my moto 360 after a few seconds of use until I restart the watch.",
        "Working fine Ok now I figured it now, I can swipe up/down to select view different ip cam.  Next phase please add PTZ motion control in the Android Wear too.  Nice app!!",
        "This is awesome and works great This is a really cool app and we'll made. I would love auto updating on a set interval or something but it is not need for the situation I use it for. I use foscams with the jpeg cgi URL which works great."

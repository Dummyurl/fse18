        "I've gone between several weather apps over the years but I'm happiest with Weather Timeline. Great widgets too, which is where a lot of competitors fail.   That said, where's my favourite Easter egg gone when searching for a date in the future (via a calendar)?? I'm sad if it's been removed.",
        "Works pretty good but widget no longer will update on my home screen, even when tapping on the refresh button.  I have to open the app and only THEN will the widget update.  This is on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 running stock Android 7.1.1.  Still works fine on my Note 4 running Android 6.0.1.  Contacted developer weeks ago about the issue and problem hasn't been fixed.  Uninstalling and going to paid version of Weather UG.  WOW, I posted the above review 11.28.17 and ZERO response from the developer and no update to fix the issue.",
        "This app used to work great and was one of my favorite weather apps ever. Since today, it crashes immediately after opening on my OnePlus 5 (Android O). Please fix it and I'll give back 5 stars",
        "First of all, developer ignore his clients, doesn't respond EVER, even if we paid for the app. Widgets could be prettier, with clock and all info. You need to add more weather providers. Advance UI, it looks outdated. And we paid for time machine and now it's gone, really?",
        "Like the app but it's bad that the icon options don't contain icons for every weather they predict, leaving iconless \"holes\" for some weather types. Also should be updated with more icon sets.",
        "Edit: switched the weather source from dark sky to weather underground. Much more dependable. Love the layout. Radar maps are pretty useful. The problem is that the forecast is almost always wrong. Temps vary by several degrees from other apps, and those other apps are always more accurate."

        "Works. Few changes would be nice. Works on my moto 360 1st gen. (S7 phone) swipe to the left to see your notes from the app, or just tap the large button to add another. Would like to be prompted for title first. Or have some sort of auto title (such as date and time) rather than take the note then the title. Just lacks some customizability.",

        "The Android app is substantially better than the Windows app or the web app.  It requires relogin too frequently, and has a few other annoying popups that interrupt quickly joining and leaving meetings.  (Like the persistent requests to rate the app).  It can automatically join audio, which is nice, but doesn't handle different connectivity conditions smoothly (assumes you always are logged into wifi).",
        "Everything was fine until I received a phone call. After the call ended, the sound went very muted and I had to keep my ear next to the speaker to follow the conversation. Fortunately, it was question period so nothing visual had to be followed",
        "The main problem I faced was that even though meetings are there on my calendar,  some recurring ones don't show up in the mobile app. Not sure if recurring ones need some special settings or something.",
        "Absolutely horrible. Works one week. Fails the next. Volume is so soft I cannot understand it even if held near my ear with volume on 100%. No features. Webex has no meaningful support for Linux desktop. Ugh.",
        "Sharing access is not supported on mobile. Joined a meeting and wanted control the host pc for some navigation purpose, but unable to request access at the same time host could not provide me the control to access. Is this a limitation or restriction. In other terms great app.",
        "I had 3 parties on call and we had to end call and call on our cell phones because we could not hear each other.  I feel like I've paid for nothing. Even the chat did not work!"

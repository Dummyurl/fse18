        "I don't know what to say, except this is great? I kinda assumed this was impossible, last time I tried to find an app for it they all said it couldn't be done without root. But it works exactly as advertised. I needed to uninstall a debug version of an app on my 1.0 watch and ABD wasn't working, so this is kinda a life saver. Perhaps add the uninstall option to the mobile version as well, but all in all, I'm very impressed."

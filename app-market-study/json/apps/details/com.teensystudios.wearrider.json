        "Phone version is pretty good... Meh for LG G Watch The Wear version is pretty bad. No way to exit (unless you have the palm gesture on). This would have been okay if it was the only problem. It's not. The beginning of the game (first 50-100m) is really slow and boring, completely unnecessarily slow. The deal breaker for the Wear version is that sometimes, there are cars in all 3 lanes at the same time so you have no where to go and die. This sucks and ends the game prematurely.",
        "Works very well but please improve the a little problem in response otherthan that works like butter",
        "It sucks It does go with your moto 360 bull crap",
        "This game is so boring no challenge at all.",
        "You know it doesnt say FOR ANDROID WEAR OR ANYTHING ABSOLUTE PEICE OF TRASH",
        "Still cant quit Please help!!!"

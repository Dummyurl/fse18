        "Started a 14 day trial of premium, but everytime I try to use any of the premium features it takes me back to the sign up for premium page, Google Play confirms I have an active subscription. Restore purchases button also does not function.",
        "A great app to keep track of all of your flights and get reminders so that no check-in is missed.",
        "Interesting.  However it seems you MUST link an account for the phone app to work.  WOn't even allow you to enter a flight manually.   And the Android Wear app REQUIRES a google login.  No reason for this - as I only want to enter my flight info MANUALLY.  WHy do I have to give up access to email, contacts, phone calls, etc... ?",
        "Love it !",
        "I only needed an app that displays my flights and my personal flight info such as seat number, confirmation numbers, etc. On the older version of this app, I was able to do that relatively more easily. But the latest update of the app became unnecessarily complicated and busy. There are about 2 dozen tabs you have to navigate through and all for things like reviews of airports that are old and dated that are pulled from Google that are completely useless when you're literally just trying to grab quick info about your flight. Most of the tabs that will notify you of anything important require a subscription. The app displays a number of timelines and so forth but none are accurate as they are not updated until after your flight is already over. So unless you love looking at info on flights you've taken to feel nostalgia, this flight has no great value.",
        "So many problems with this app.. For instance can't restore subscription. Slow. Tired of \"just contact us\". Too complicated. Google another app, and whatever you do, don't pay for it!!"

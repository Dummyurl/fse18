        "Useless Doesn't display any information. Location just says \"city\" and temperature is 00° and it's always fog. You have to pay to get to settings, but there isn't any options really, so why bother? It's does look good though.",
        "Display cut off This looked awesome until I tried it on Moto 360 2nd gen. The display is cut off and is not nearly as elegant as the promo images. Maybe I'll try it again in the future. Uninstalled.",
        "Amazing app Love it, helps me a ton in geometry. Great interface :p",
        "It doesn't actually do rotary motion Lame",
        "Meh You need to pay for anything beyond basic functions. No thanks",
        "Sorry, fails simple calculation First test I do on any calculator app is 16÷3*3, should be 16, this calculator gives 15.99 - fail! Android calculator gets it right."

        "Would be amazing to work with watch faces on Android wear 2.0. To have the next prayer time on my pre-installed watch faces for my LG watch sport. Hope the dev updates it soon Inshallah",
        "LG G square watch Great app. But when displaying the time, it cuts the Magrib and Isha time in Arabic. It doesn't render to fit the entire display of the LG G square watch. Please fix. Thanks.",
        "Need fix JAK for such app. I am using it on LG Watch and found the last two prayers are not fully displayed.  They are cut off. That's all for now.",
        "It's good, but it could be better... Please can you resize or give option to resize as on Sony Smartwatch 3 it doesn't show Maghrib or Esha Prayer times.",
        "Great app Need resizing... Magrib and Isha not display properly on resolution 320x320",

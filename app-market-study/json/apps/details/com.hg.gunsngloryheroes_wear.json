        "Fun but has an issue The application is off centered on the 2nd generation Moto 360. The game play and start screens are both shifted up and to the left, leaving black areas instead of the game play filling the screen",
        "Fun wear game. . .but I love it and it is a great wear time killer.  I wish we had more levels.   I maxed out in days, which leaves you wanting.",

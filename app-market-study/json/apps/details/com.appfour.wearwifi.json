        "Great app for locating WiFi signals!",
        "I like it",
        "Cool",
        "Since my LG Watch Sport updated to Oreo, I can no longer connect using EAP in a university network to other than the original router. For example, if I setup the network in Location A, the watch connects correctly, but if I move to Location B with the same network present, the watch will refuse to connect (status of network remains at \"Saved\"). The opposite scenario (setup in B successfully and then move to A) also yields the same result."

        "Excellent task app. Syncs well with Office 365 tasks and Outlook emails with flag to follow up. Can easily add categories, filter, sort, etc. Far and away the best task app I've ever used. We'll worth the cost. Only thing would be good to see an easier way to extend due dates without opening each task.",
        "Great solution to a massive flaw in Outlook. Why doesn't OWA do this? I will never understand Microsoft.",
        "Outstanding app!!! Long overdue and very comprehensive. Does more that bridge the gap between mobile and Exchange servers. Thanks so much for an awesome addition to my productivity.  Rick R",
        "Integration with Outlook tasks makes this app superior to all other productivity apps.",
        "the most complete task solution : sharing from other apps , and super flexible configuration options makes a unbeatable team with a flexible email app",
        "I use it all the time to keep track of my goals."

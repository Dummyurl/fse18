        "The app is good but sometimes the voice output doesn't work. It would be great if some of the info showed on the lock screen.",
        "Outdated UI Seriously, this costs over $8. The user interface/experience is terrible. The worst out of every GPS logging application I've tried. Please update to a modern UX. 3 stars because I love how accurate it is, and automatic uploads to different logging dashboards.",
        "Great app! I have used this app since it was on the Pocket PC. The service is incredible and the product only gets better. The only thing i would change is that I would like to see custom voice settings that change with the sport chosen.",
        "User for four years!",
        "Great but stagnant Like many long term users, I started with pocket pc. The functionality it's still tops, but hasn't been updated since then, apart from bits. They already have my money, so they're not missing out from me. But for simple and current, I've been recommending Runtastic to all my new runners. I just can't justify recommending good software if it's old and expensive. Time to update!",

        "This will be revolutionary. Epic. Just beyond epic. Though unfortunately for me, I do believe there is a current bug with either android 6.0.1 or CM13 because any screen recording applications instantly cause a system reboot. So like the screen recording apps I have tried, when I press start now it instantly reboots my phone sadly. I am going to further troubleshoot and look into this issue more then I'll contact you. In case it is a limitation with android marshmallow. Regardless you get 5 stars as this is as I said. Revolutionary.",
        "Trying to get this to work, looks promising. However, please clarify. DOES THE PHONE NEED TO BE ROOTED, or is Root access just for this apps permissions. ( my G note 3 is NOT rooted). Thx all. (And keep up the great work! )",
        "Love the idea Not currently working with moto 360 sport paired with galaxy j3 (6). I am keeping it installed and waiting for updates.",
        "Amazing! It's not perfect but still deserves 5 stars just because of the possibilities.",
        "perfect app for android wear it is a must have app. Big thumb up the dev of this app.",
        "Great app!"

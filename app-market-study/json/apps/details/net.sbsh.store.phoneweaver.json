        "No longer works consistently This app was great when I first got it several phones ago. Ever since Android 5.0, it has been inconsistent. I made sure that the navigation icon remains enabled at all times, but the app is still buggy. It won't always restart with my phone, location-based profile changes no longer happen, and sometimes it's on but still won't change profiles according to preset parameters. I used to love PhoneWeaver and now it barely works",
        "Zero Support !!! The app keeps asking for registration, despite my purchase. All emails to developer's support remain unanswered. This is a fraud, don't buy this app !",
        "Widget Widget 1*1 became too big. The lable is not visible. Besides, some functions are not working, like switching off-line mode.",
        "Nothing automatic about it None of the profiles switch automatically.  Makes no difference if it is set to switch by time. location or connection type none of these work.  I have to manually switch profiles all day which defeats the purpose of this app.  Uninstalling.",
        "Doesn't turn on gps! I don't know why no apps can actually turn on gps, but unfortunately, this is no exception. Also, the wife keeps turning itself on, even when the profile turns it off. Uninstalled until these issues are fixed.",
        "Won't transfer to new phone They make you pay for it again when you move to a new phone."

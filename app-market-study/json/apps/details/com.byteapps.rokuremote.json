        "I've used this app for a long time now, and I absolutely love it. So much less annoying than Roku's official app. My only complaint is that the dev removed the landscape mode. Since I have a long phone that only sits sideways, I miss that feature.",
        "I got screwed I bought this one thinking it was the Roku Wear Remote. That one cost less and has the complete remote control on the wear.  This stupid app only has play and pause.",
        "Works perfectly Thanks for this app! My kids are constantly losing the remote. This app completely solved that problem. Bonus it works for multiple roku sticks without any programming involved. Just install and use. Easy.",
        "Works Good This is the best Roku remote I have found thus far. It does still need a little tweeking though. It does not recognize my Roku Stick nor my TCL Roku TV (but they do connect manually) and the one thing lacking from ALL of the Roku apps except the official; does not control the volume or wake a Roku TV from Eco Mode. So I find myself switching back and forth between the two (this has better layout than the official app). Hopefully these can be addressed in the future.",
        "Outstanding app. Spent first 5 minutes trying to figure out how to configure it to multiple Roku devices, before realizing it auto configured itself and was ready for use. Exceptionally easy, user friendly. Top job.",
        "Love it! Great alternative for remote."

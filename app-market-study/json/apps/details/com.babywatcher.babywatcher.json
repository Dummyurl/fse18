It connects by using the normal WiFi network and works in the background of your device. It alerts you as soon as your baby makes a noise.\nYou need two devices. One will work as the watcher device, which should be kept with the parent. The other one will act as the baby device, which should be placed close to the baby.\nThe baby device is intended to be put close to your sleeping baby. It will act as a noise sensor and will securely surveil your baby's sleep. If the baby device receives a call or a text it will be forwarded to the watcher device without disturbing your baby.\nThe watcher device is your interface with the baby. It hides in the background so that you can use your device normally without unnecessary disturbance. Yet it will alert you as soon as your baby makes a noise. It is also easy to access the app from the notification bar if you want to check on your baby manually.\nSome of the current features include:• Wizard to ease the setup.• Automatic detection of baby devices on the Wifi network.• WiFi connection with seamless reconnection.• Video streaming to watch your baby sleeping.• Logging of events from the baby crib.• Forward calls or SMSs to the baby device to the watcher device.• Battery and status information from the baby device.• Listen to the baby at any time by clicking the listen button.• Pause the monitor from watcher or baby device while you are soothing your baby.• The sound indicators shows you if there is any sound and at what level.• Set a custom name of your baby to easily find your baby device on the WiFi!• Remote trigger level setting, so you don't have to disturb the baby when updating your settings.• Widely configurable with options for customizing dialogs, mic level, baby name and so forth.• Control your baby watcher directly from your smart watch!These are just some examples of what the app can do.

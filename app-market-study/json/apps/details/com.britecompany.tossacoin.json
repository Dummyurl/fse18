        "It is beautiful but i am having problems with it Tried it on Moto360 on android 5.0.1(maybe why there is problems) It take longer than expected to load and crashes sometimes when i open it. Also the background of the text is black not transparent which hide the coin.  Update: thanks for the quick reply and fix. And it will be awesome if you make a phone app to go with it and more coins.",
        "Simple yet great Simple application, but works great and comes in handy... A must-have on your smartwatch!",
        "Goed, enkel iets te weinig willekeurigheid Deze app is interessant en gebruikzaam, maar enkel iets te voorspelbaar."

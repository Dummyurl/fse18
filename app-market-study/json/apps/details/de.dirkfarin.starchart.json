        "Looks awesome, but one problem ... Where do I input my location? I clicked the settings icon, but nowhere does it ask for location. And the app on my watch is asking me to open the host app and do so. Kind of confused.",
        "Awesome This is one of my most used Wear apps and is an excellent example of what the platform can be used for. Very smooth, fluid, and informative. I love seeing the names of the different constellations when I stand in front of them and the planet locations. A must for anyone with an interest in the Cosmos.",
        "Neat app. Well worth the download. Your location is derived from your phone. You'll need the GPS turned on.",
        "Only the quick instruction shows up No response, can not open the chart",
        "Works well! Great little app for my Moto 360 and absolutely free. 5 stars!",
        "Can't get it on my watch How do I get it on my watch?"

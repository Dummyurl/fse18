        "Best notes app I've ever had. Lightweight, online sync between mobile and desktop, dark theme, categorize notes. Covers all my needs.",
        "It does what I exactly need.",
        "5 Stars, But a REQUEST. I've used every single app in this category. Simplicity and Faster sync than any other makes this one perfect. I've already dropped others for this. Just one REQUEST : *Add either checklists or simple lists (unordered) . That is so so needed as this is text only app. (We don't need images by the way, please be simple in future too)",
        "Even though the programmers have not built in a word correction facility, I know it can be done by adding a dictionary file and reference engine. Its like a small website for your Notes. Thanks for this powerful app. I loved it. Go download it and use for school notes, official notes etc. You will also love. Best among many.",
        "Great to finally have a notes app for Android and Linux! I've been wanting this for years, but everything else falls short. It even has decent markdown support.  Only 4 stars are possible for lack of widget.",
        "Used to be great - then went cloud only.  Forced update wiped my local notes then required an account sign in.  If I wanted that I would have used EverNote.  Has no differentiation now, avoid."

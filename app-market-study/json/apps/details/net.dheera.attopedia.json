        "Mildly frustrating It's hard to see more than a sentence or two at a time.  Why format the text so it only fills half of a tiny watch screen??  Would be 5 stars if the text would fill the screen.  This would also benefit from a history (list of recently searched subjects) and maybe a small cache (to save battery by not having to xfer the same material a 2nd time).",
        "Not quite complete. AFTER UPDATE STILL GIVES  UNABLE TO CONNECT MESSAGE...Completes voice search of intended article, but then gives a connection error, and freezes, every time...... LG Urbane. If updated and corrected, then yes, it would be a solid app.",
        "Resolved fantastic app! The best Smartwatch I have seen on any OS. Great info right on your wrist!  My only complaint is that there are large borders (a lot of wasted screen space) when you get to reading the text. UPDATE - Connection issue resolved! Thank you, Dheera! On my Sony Smartwatch 3 I keep receiving a connection failed message trying to load more info after initial search",
        "I get this message every time, even though I can connect with other apps. Not sure if it's an issue with the brand new version of wear or what...Moto 360  EDIT: Switched to a Galaxy S6 and all Android wear apps I've had an issue with, are no longer an issue.  Thanks!",
        "Search fails It recognizes my voice search then fails to fetch the information. Basically never leaving the screen that says tap to search. (Using Moto 360 Gen 1)",
        "Connection Failed Gives me \"connection failed\" message when i press on any article to open it. Liked the concept but it's useless for me because of this bug."

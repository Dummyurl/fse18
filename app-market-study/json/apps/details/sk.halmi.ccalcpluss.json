        "Very helpful for adding multiple currencies TOGETHER.  Feedback:. The calculator keypad is not standard....Please make standard layout or have option to change layout.  2nd. Bug in calculator that after clicking plus, then the first time I press decimal it doesn't register.  I have to always press decimal twice.  I have Google Pixel with all updates.  Update June 1 2017.  Terrible bug in calculator function that resets the number when typing a decimal.  No joke.  If you type 420.64 in the calculator, you'll end up with .64.  frustrating.",
        "Love this App. It's fast and quick, instant results. Great when travelling to see how much things cost and what your spending. You can just have a few currencies on screen or lots, it's up to you. Well worth the small fee I paid. Actually checked yesterday in town against several exchange rates and could see how much you get ripped off my buying other currencies. I wouldn't be without this App, espeacially as I  live in Thailand part of the year. Only thing I would love is a Text Alert. Great. Update on my review. Been using this app a while now. Excellent app. Would not be without it. Accurate when I was exchanging money in Thailand. Great app and worth every penny. 5 Star.",
        "App gives me an impression of the value of the £ against € and vv. It dos not tell me what I should expect the exchange rate to be in a foreign exchange shop eg Western Union in say UK OR Europe. If it did, it would create more competition. And less victims of sharp practice.",
        "Very good Used 'Easy Currency Converter' for a long time but this one is superior due to being able to type into any currency without having to choose and swap what you want to work with.",
        "Not helping with my basic needs No shortlist \"what do I pay for one unit of other currencies using mine\". Little trust as there's no view of rate date and update date. Looks ok otherwise."

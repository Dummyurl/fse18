        "Works perfectly. I needed to test the Gryoscope on my Moto360 to see if it was working properly, and this app did a great job. The cube wasn't turning around at all which meant that the Gryoscope wasn't working properly, as I feared, and when testing on a new device, I used this to confirm the results and found the cube to turn as it should on a working Gyroscope. Very useful tool."

        "Doesn't sound an alarm. Doesn't allow any interaction with app either. Will not recognize my wrist unit even though my phone is doing so. Would have liked this to work.   :-(",
        "Good but just shy of great. I like this app it's straight forward and simple, but verses it's free rival, 7wear, this app doesn't do much to differentiate itself. It would be nice to have a few more settings and personalization options in the app such as the ability to shuffle the order of the workouts and change the vibration settings as well as set up reminders in case you forget to work out. Also a bit more proofreading should be done in the exercise discretions because I noticed that \"to\" was used instead of \"two\" in places.",

        "Great concept.  Simple and gets me moving.  Even minutes helps. However on a Moto 360 it has crashed the first couple of times.  I will update soon after more testing.  update: made it most of the way through the workout today before crashing . Seems to be getting better?",

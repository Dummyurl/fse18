        "- Trying to play videos conforming to the required parameters routinely produces a, 'Cannot play' message - whilst on another occasion the same video might well play. Additionally this app is impaired by the absence of a standalone option. - Quite surprising really that it seems there's no satisfactory Wear video player to be had anywhere.",
        "Very disappointing. Once it loads there is a black screen with only the audio playing. Video does not work. Please fix.",
        "It Really works highly recommended! Stereo sound",
        "Nokia very nice mobile phone",
        "It has a lot to be desired but all and all nothing out there better",
        "Great that it lets you view videos but it always stops after a min or 2 into running the video. Please fix this so we can give it a five. Or advise on what to do if its just a certain setting that can be adjusted."

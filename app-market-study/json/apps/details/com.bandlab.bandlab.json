        "I get better sounding vocals with this app than I've ever gotten from spending be hundreds of dollars on protools equiptment, FireWire microphones and soundproofing materials. Not for nothing, even though I still can't edit my profile information even after logging out and logging back in, this app is low-key legit once you get the hang of it. Not for nothing but I can see this app getting low-key popular in the future.",
        "Great app for making music. Good quality sound. Good guitar effects. Good quality vocal recording, dont even need to plug in my microphone, I directly record on phone mic. But just one thing is missing; Midi support..... Using pads is really hard. I hope you add midi support too.  Thank You",
        "I love this app so much! It's easy to use and make music in my style. But i have a problem now. The app cant record any sound from my device after pushing red button. The other recording apps still can. I've tried re-install, turn on recording permission, and reboot the device. But it doesn't work. Please help me. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "Can't even make it past creating my name? It just continues to load . I'll keep trying but if it won't work my rating will drop more.  Update: Rating changed to 5 star's. I Love the app,but it seems to be slow with my device? Running with Samsung Galixy S5.  Other then that everything is fantastic!",
        "Keeps on messing up my songs that I've spent hours working on! When I publish it, it changes the tempo, tone and sound of my voice/music. It's really annoying me now!",
        "This might be a good app. I'm not really sure because I COULDN'T EVEN START IT. The bottom of my phone covered one of the 'next' buttons completely, making it impossible to go further than the genres of music part. Shame, I was looking forward to using it."

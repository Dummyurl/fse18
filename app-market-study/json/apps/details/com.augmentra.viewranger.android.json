        "Viewranger is an incredibly versatile and useful app.  I always use it when walking or cycling.  I recently had a problem  when the app wouldn't open, so I contacted viewranger support and received  fantastic help from a chap named Mike, who soon had me up and running again.  Altogether brilliant!",
        "I have used this app for several years and it has made my walks, runs and cycling so much more enjoyable. It never lets me down and reduces the stress of navigating considerably. The after sales support is faultless. If only all apps\\companies were as good!",
        "It doesn't tell you that it needs certain things on your device for skyline to work, and it doesn't let you know if there is anything you can do to add it. Also, none of my local trails were included, and I live near county Park and national monuments.",
        "This is the best adventure enabling and adventure tracking app! I love how your profile syncs with their servers. It enables you to easily plan routes on the pc then sync to your phone to use out. Doesn't need service to track via gps. Never had any issues. Highly recommend it! But wish it were more known and social!  Also wish there was a way to see all tracks I've recorded on the website on the PC! Asking too much? Maybe but you guys can develop that ðŸ˜‰",
        "Great for recording routes and as a navigational back up, plus I find it extremely helpful when planning routes. Thumbs up.",
        "Can import and export gpx so no vendor lock in. As a result this app provides pretty great maps and features."

        "A new, easier way to save offline maps.",
        "An improved way to switch map types.",
        "NEW! View and download Ordnance Survey maps for the whole of Great Britain for just $28.49 a year!",
        "A few bug fixes, in particular to saving maps in the far part of the eastern hemisphere."

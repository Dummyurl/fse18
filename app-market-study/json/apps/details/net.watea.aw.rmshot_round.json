        "The photos show that the screen is full with the camera image but in fact there are either black bars on the top or side depending on your orientation.  This should be an option, don't care if I'm missing some of the image   wtf?  emailed dev, no response.  what would also be nice is a button to force on the light.  No response.  Don't waste your money.  Try something else like PixtoCam, that does video and you can force the light on in that mode.",
        "I used to have an LG G4 and paired it with the LG Watch Urbane. Since the application had a native app, I didn't need a third party remote shutter.  However, when I had to switch phones and switched to the Samsung Galaxy Note FE, the remote shutter thing on my watch is my most missed feature on my old phone. Note that I still have the Urbane as my daily driver as it ain't broke yet.  I was hesitant to buy this at first due to the lack of (legitimate) reviews, and after trying it out, it's definitely works. The black bars shouldn't really bother you., and it's better this way as that's the same way how the native remote shutter app works when I had an LG phone.  Things I liked: 1.) Ability to stream the shot from your phone to your watch, much like the old native remote shutter app. 2.) More fine controls like setting up the timer and flash from the watch 3.) Can still take pictures even with the flip cover closed 4.) Silent shots Things to improve: 1.) Ability to store pictures on SD card 2.) Ability to take videos. 3.) I literally can't find the \"doze' mode.   Things that I would want to work but is very unlikely: 1:) Make it compatible with the native camera app.",
        "Thanks for the app. Love it.",
        "Android 6 issues Worked fine on my LG G Watch R and Note 4, not so much with my Nexus 6P. Just tells me another program is using the camera.",
        "Sound mute does not work I purchased because it specifically says you can turn off the shutter sound. I have a Huawei watch and the feature does not work. If this bug cannot be fixed let me know and I will request a refund.",

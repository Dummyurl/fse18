        "Great stocks app so far, only problem I have found is the charts. Some stocks display the 1 and 5 day charts correctly, but the 1 month and 1 year charts are blank, other stocks are the exact opposite and only display the month/year charts while the day charts are blank.  Upgraded to five star due to quick response from dev",
        "Great easy to read charts and handfuls of information, really complete.",
        "Great app.  Portfolio works well.",
        "Quality app Have been using this app for a few months now & have found it to be on No 1 stocks app. Comprehensive with helpful developer.",
        "Fantastic Worth the price. Works brilliantly.",
        "cool app exactly what i was looking for Great support for android wear and widgets..  It will be great if it can automatically pull my portfolio from Google finance as I do buy and sell stocks a lot."

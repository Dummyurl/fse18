        "I wish I could get my money back on this one. The barcode scanner causes the app to quit. The thumbnail of a manually entered file does not show up on the shelf, though it does if you tap on the folder to open it. If you try to enter a title and singer/musician and then do search, you get the message that nothing was found. (On a Beatles album? Vince Gill? etc. Come on!)  Don't waste you money on this one.",
        "Needs lots of work. Cover art not showing up on album, some will show up if you touch the artists folder but not on the artist. No way to fetch cover art all at once. You have to do one album at a time. This is not good.",
        "Takes way to long to create a collection with this app.  I gave up after a few hours when I only had a dozen items completed.  Cannot recommend.",
        "Crashes a LOT The free version worked great, this paid version imported the free version list fine,  barcode scanner worked for about ten CDs now it just keeps crashing. If it would let me scan anything I'd love it, but this seems pretty broken",
        "Good concept. Need a lot of work. Not bad for start. But have serious flav. Can't add more than one disk at the time from artist search. Scanning barcode way to too often can't find a CD. No option to import track records. No full list of artists discography.",
        "Just a tip for those that are trying to transfer your library from one device to another. IT DOES NOT BACKUP TO AN SD CARD. You will need to backup to your old device then go into your files and move the com.dandydev.medialibrary folder to your SD card. Then put the SD card in the new device and replace the com.dandydev.medialibrary folder on your device with the one from the SD card."

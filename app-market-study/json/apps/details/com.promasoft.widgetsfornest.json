        "The app is by far the best Nest widget I've used yet with a creative pop-up panel to adjust temp and whatnot.  I can't adjust where each individual element goes, but the Dev said that's something he'll work on in the future. The Dev is fast to reply, which is always amazing to see.  Development has been a little slow for a bit now is the only reason for 4 star.",
        "I paid for this app. Didn't work with Oreo when I got my new Pixel 2 XL. I contacted the dev and he told me it should be compatible with Oreo by the end of the following week. Except that was 3 months ago and he no longer responds to emails. Now I have an app that I paid for and I can not use any more. What a waste. Very disappointing.",
        "Works ok, but the excessive battery draining is real showstopper. To bad, because normal battery usage would lift this app all the competition far behind",
        "Stopped recognizing thermostat.  Tried dropping and adding account, but no thermostat.  Same after clearing data/cache.",
        "Love all the features except when I add the widget shortcut and use it to toggle away/home, the away says 0 when it's actually 16.5.  Also very hard on the battery.",
        "Integration with Tasker does not work. Developer does not respond to questions about this."

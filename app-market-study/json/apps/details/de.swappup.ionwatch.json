        "Very buggy and frequently crashes Good concept but the execution is not quite there. App crashes very frequently (e.g. when rerouting) and is not at all reliable - I ride a motorcycle and was looking to use my SmartWatch 2 as GPS display. Also the arrows do not turn green as you approach turns/junctions with Google Maps. Please improve the app and it will be a really useful piece of software but as it stands it shouldn't really be here for sale.",

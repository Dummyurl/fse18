        "App worked as intended, but when I woke up this morning, it told me the app couldn't log in. I purchased the full version, thinking it may solve my problem. It didn't. I've generated new app passwords, then disabled app passwords all together, nothing works. Can't find a way to contact any type of support team. Until this issue is fixed, I cannot recommend this app.",
        "It works very good. Only problem I cannot add iCloud email with my app specific password. All other email services worked (Hotmail Gmail)",
        "This app doesn't work in my fossil smart watch. Team, Kindly solve the issues or refund the money I paid to buy this app.",
        "Simple. Effective. Just right",
        "Overall I love the app, but there needs to be a way that you don't get a separate notification for every email. Somedays I'll end up with 150 separate notifications, that's way too much. If there was an option to eliminate individual notifications and just announced you have 150 emails, that way you could open the app itself to view them would be great. Uninstalling for now until such a feature is available.",
        "The free version is legit - Can't ask for more!"

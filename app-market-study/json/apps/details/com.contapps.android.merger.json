        "Pathetic performance It has now been 24 hrs since I downloaded the software and it is still running in the background and unable to complete merging 360 contacts. More than half still to go.",
        "Did the work Simple and easy. Been searching for contacts merger from a long time but no luck. So many apps showed the number of contacts to be merged but they didn't merge. This thing did it just with a click. Liked itüëç",
        "No ads, no crap. Did exactly what they said they would do.  Only unable to choose which of the merge contacts I want to keep. Sometimes it chooses the contact's email as the new name but its an easy fix. I can retype that myself.",
        "This used to be a great app when using Marshmallow based rom. Now with Nougat based rom this app freezes and does nothing. Please fix it for nougat based roms and update the app. would definitely  worth 5 stars if its fixed with Nougat based Roms.",
        "Very bad  app Don't let you do simple tasks. Always redirecting to different pages",
        "Constant crashes with 7.1 Get this fixed please. Crashes during search, every time. Without fail."

        "The only simple flashlight app for Wear on Play! You open the app, which opens faster than any other flashlight on Play,  and the white screen is immediately displayed. You swipe the app away and it's gone. No tapping to start the flashlight is needed. No strobe or color changing when you accidentally tap the screen. I love it for its simplicity."

        "Sony SmartWatch 3 Nice app. Can't edit list of scanned codes (delete, replace). If I could, or if developer addresses this function, I would surely give a better rating.",
        "Working, but QR too Big App is working again on LG G Watch R, but QR codes are a bit too large.  You know, there is something in the Wear API to handle that..."

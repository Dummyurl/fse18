        "Like the appearance and seems to be only compass that should work on moto 360 1st gen. However I cannot get the compass to work at all having the 360 stuck on the app display, I have tried restarts and settings but nothing found to fix the issue. Please resolve this and rating will improve. Thanks.",
        "Works well, just what I needed. Just had to restart moto 360. Will buy pro version. Also trying to figure out a way to launch it more easily from the watch. It's a little convoluted with the Moto.",
        "Worked well until marshmallow update. This is a nice app that does what it says. Well at least until the marshmallow update on the moto 360 1st gen. The compass is now stuck at 360Â°. Confident the developer will address this issue.",
        "Really works after so many crap. And it shows what it showing should. Scouts, couple deegrees its not a problem. LG Urbane Androidwear 2. Hvala covjece! :-)",
        "Simply Works. Looks great on Moto Usually I need a compass to get the sense of position inside a building. This is a great tool for me. Just have to restart my moto 360 before it can run properly. need fix here. but really, just put a warning to restart the watch after instalation should be fine.",
        "Moto 360 Watchmaker / XCompass issues These seem unable to play nice.  Which ever gets access first works - but then fails once the other tries to access the compass - at which point the working one also fails.  Symptoms - inaccurate reading in second app, then freezing in first app.  I assume one or both apps are attempting to open sensors exclusively - which would seem weird for a read only operation.  This is an app. issue, not hardware as the sensor carries on reporting movement just fine.  App is basic, but fine.  Update: I am not sure the statement that only one app can get sensor data is correct (may depend on how you are getting the data) as I have two apps gathering step data successfully, also using SensorDashboard (an app) it reports all sensors while they are being used by the other apps."

        "I am using this for weather and maps (love the live update on the map as you edit). I think it is a great effort. Yes there are glitches but it deserves a better rating so giving it 5 stars. Also donated $5 to remove ads. Please keep working on this developer. It's good to see something more than the usual video casting apps!",
        "First impressions are mixed. There are some glitches with the bottom advert, that needs to be sorted urgently. Looking at comments below, I agree, we need a preview built into the app. Also, it would be good to see some developer responses to the comments left here. Feedback man!!! Talk to the people who want to use your app.",
        "Works really well, love the auto connect option.   Wish there was a preview mode in the app, but that's not super important.   Tip: use with HDMI-CEC and your TVs built in scheduled off command to turn on and off your TV without any action if your own",
        "A lot of good potential here with a few major issues: 1. Calendar doesn't refresh. If you don't re-cast every day, you'll have events being shown that are long past displaying. 2. The notes section is terribly broken. In order to get the white font to show up on the cast screen, I have to write text that is invisible (white) on the phone.",
        "This is the Chromecast app I've been waiting for. A little rough around the edges but still exactly what I've wanted for a Chromecast dashboard. Would love to see support for a Google Play Music or Spotify widget...that would make this app near perfect in my eyes.",
        "Was doing great. Only had a few options to decide from and when it kept saying 7 below when it was 23 above, I knew there was no use for this app with no other decent choices."

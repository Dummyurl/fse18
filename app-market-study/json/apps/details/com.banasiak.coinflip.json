        "Wonderful app! My family and I are terrible at flipping coins, so we use this app for board and card games. True to its name, it really is simple and truly random. I made some Pokemon themed coins to customize it for our game. Thank you, this app truly is a gem.",
        "To all the people that leaves off a star just because they didn't have a certain coin or design....you're retarded. It's a coin FLIP app. Not a feelings app",
        "Love it I tried other coin flip apps but this is by far the best one. Also it is very easy to use.",
        "I give 5star although i dont know about these game😂..did any benefit you can get of these game😉",
        "Ad free and no permissions required not like so many other apps out there. Simple, affective and it works (HTC M8). Thanks.",

        "New app icon - by an actual professional!",
        "Note: the app is now compiled against the latest SDK for Android 7.0 (Nougat). The permission model has changed and now Google Play lumps all of the \"safe\" permissions into a single bucket called \"Other\". This app only requires the \"vibrate\" permission, but unfortunately that puts it in the same bucket as \"receive data from Internet\" and others. However, you can verify the app doesn't request any permissions via Settings -> Apps -> Coin Flip. Sorry. :("

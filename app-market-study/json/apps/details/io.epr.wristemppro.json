        "When I say start or open \"thermostat control\", the watch takes me to the web and does not open the app.",
        "The Nests missing feature Very handy. I like that I can preheat my home on my drive from work",
        "Working well with LG Urbane, very nice looking interface. Way better than the Android Wear apps that come with Calida",
        "Works as described And does it well!  Which is more than I can say for most of the other Wear implementations of Nest controls.",
        "Works as described",
        "As far as I’m aware, there are only a couple of apps available for controlling the Nest thermostat on Android Wear devices and this one is by far the best by quite some margin. The design is visually top class, and the voice control works perfectly. Also the ability to set the Thermostat into ‘Home’ & ‘Away’ mode directly from the watch is extremely useful!  Excellent communication from the developer when I had some queries after first installing.   All in all, just what I’ve been looking for to control the Nest from my Moto 360."

        "Good ðŸ’¡ still needs improvement Still to small.  Coin would look better if it were the size of the screen.  Bad implementation.  For the Moto 360.",
        "Directions are misleading. Need to start coin flipper before you use voice commands. Directions need to be revised.",
        "Can't get it to start with \"OK, Google\". Flipping works fine but it would be good if you could swipe up and down to show \"this is heads\", \"this is tails\". Then tap to flip.",
        "Works Suggestion, Put app on phone with choices of different currency. Possibly even a his and hers option. Would come in handy with the dishes ha. Good job",

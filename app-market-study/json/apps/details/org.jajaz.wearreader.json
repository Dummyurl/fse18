        "Probably the best reader. Especially for txt format",
        "This is a rip off! Do not buy! It's absolutely impossible to transfer books with it. If I use another app for the transfer, it's still impossible to open them with this garbage. Do not buy!",
        "Absolutely fantastic app.  The ONLY reader app for Android Wear that actually works...and works well.  Autoscroll, clean, efficient interface, fonts, optional folders, PDF support, etc.  Really great job!",
        "Good app",

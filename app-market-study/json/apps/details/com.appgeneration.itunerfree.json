        "Great app. Previously used radiotuner but too many issues. This is way better. Is stable and runs fine in background connected to car. 1 thing... Please add feature to stop the app audio automatically if i disconnect bluetooth ie in car Also i have upgraded to pro but the icon and name havent updated",
        "Low ONE TIME cost.  It is NOT a music service, just streams many (all I have found) stations.  Get the NO AD version .. as the ads are \"bug like\" it seems to me.  No ad version work wonderful and you get get controls to SHUT IT of etc - which is so trick with most (they just pause).  Recommend.",
        "Ive been using this app for a long time with great result. This ap is strait up, always works very well and no ad hassles. Ad hassles is why I left the last one I used. It's a big name, won't say here. Enjoy your music.",
        "Loving this app. I used to listen to101.7 on their website but the song always stopped playing every now and then which was annoying. Thx so much for this app.  Works wonderfully. The sound quality is great, easy to use, and has a pretty layout. Definitely recommended.",
        "Support Chrome cast👍 only if play YouTube or ads on Chrome this app stops directly.... Edit; so if the app plays to Chrome cast and Chrome web browser opens a web page with ads player stops and Chrome cast says noting to play. Same issue if I want play YouTube on my phone or just a other app. Also Huawei phone manager notifi that this is a power intansive app. It's Huawei p10 lite on 7.0",
        "I have had this app for a long time now on my laptop and phone but recently it will not connect to the latter and is not an Internet connection problem. It seems to no longer connect on Bluetooth devices even though it says it's playing, so may need to get rid of it from my phone now if no solution? Very frustrating. Tried it on four different Bluetooth devices now. It was fine a around two months ago."

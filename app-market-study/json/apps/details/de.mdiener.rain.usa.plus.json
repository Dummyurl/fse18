        "The Dutch and Belgian radar data is completely blank. I'm in the eastern UK, and so I get very poor use of this app when the weather is coming from the east, with no Dutch /Belgian data!",
        "Umbrella widget is not showing as an option",
        "Thanks for Family Support! 1A App!",
        "A superb app with pure genius design. Rain Alarm Pro gives me notification when rain is on the way and I can choose any sound on my 'phone or tablet if I want an audible alarm. Since it runs a visual sequence of the rain progression on my screen, I can estimate the time of the rain's arrival and not only that, I can see very easily if the clouds are growing in size or evaporating. Brilliant, just brilliant. Astonishing support from the developer too!",
        "This app has been working fine after some problems with it a while back but today it hasn't updated the radar image for more than four hours despite the timeline at the bottom of the screen doing so. This is happening with my home wifi, on 4G and on the WiFi at work. Uninstalling and reinstalling it hasn't made any difference. This app remains stubbornly at a three star rating, I'm afraid.",
        "I owe so much to this app for staying dry. Well worth the cost! Of all the apps I have, this is the one that has stayed on my device for a long time. P. S. I have not had any notice of battery consumption using this app."

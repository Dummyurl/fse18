        "My daughter has loved colouring in this app since she was 2yrs old! The simplicity of the interface is a big reason for that. Now she is almost 6yrs old but still comes back to this, that is a testament to the quality of the images! Kudos to the app makers :)",
        "Add pop-up when trying to color this is hard to remove for children. But this came up so I'm hoping this is add free.",
        "I like it a little bit . Not so nice",
        "Its good for children, can improve with colours and position of ads so that children cannot be directed to other pages.",
        "The only problem is not being able to zoom in to color the super tiny stuff,,,",
        "My 2 and 3 year old love it"

        "The app does as promise in my sony smartwatch with a sony xperia z2. But there is plenty of room to improvement.  1st when I open the app it connect the phone to the gopro WiFi which is great, but when I close the app the phone get stuck in the gopro wifi which doesn't happen with the gopro app, it reconnect to the previous WiFi when the app closes, it would be nice to have that functionality.  2nd Is nice to have all the setitngs in the smartwatch but it would be better if it tells you which settings are on/off  3rd and most important to me, could be possible to connect the gopro directly to the smartwatch Wifi? that would be great and is what I'm looking for, I hate that I need the phone to connect to the gopro while my smartwatch has a WiFi built in.   Thanks.",
        "Works great, but some patients maybe required It took me about an hour or so of playing around with connection setup, but I was able to get done. Make sure the WiFi and Bluetooth are operating simultaneously. Customer service is great, I had an issue with the app once downloaded, and the developers were very helpful, and resolved the issue. Now that everything is working, I love the app.",
        "Crashes immediately, every time. Have reached out to support email.",
        "Rip off want my money back",
        "Does not work! Connected the phone to the gopro. The watch app keeps showing connecting..No Connection to the phone...Waste of money.",
        "Does not work It would not connect to my gopro session and the messages are in Spanish. It would not let me get a refund"

        "Set for every 15minute reminders, will update that part after testing,  otherwise: BEST  APP for STAYING HYDRATED!!!  (I just purchased the pro version)  which says a lot coming from me, I try many and I'm very fussy . Samsung Note 3, Android, love it!",
        "I really liked the free app & after a month decided to upgrade to the Premium version which has a little more oomph & no ads. Unfortunately, none of my water data transferred over from the free app to Premium. I've already done the back & forth e-mails with Aqualert trying to figure out what the issue is & if it can be fixed (& yes, I followed Aqualert's instructions). I'm hoping they get it straightened out soon because it's a nice looking, easy to use app that's not too fussy...  Update 02/14/18: Still haven't received a response from Aqualert to figure out how to transfer the data from the free app to Premium, so I just went ahead & did it manually. It IS time consuming, but not too, too long if you don't have much to input. Still 3 stars until I've had more time to use the Premium app, but again, it's a nice looking app...much cleaner looking than other water tracking apps & simple to use...we'll see how it does in terms of other glitches...",
        "Is there a way to turn off the sound when you log water? I have sounds disabled but it still plays.",
        "Great app. would be awesome if it worked with Myfitnesspal or Fitbit, any plans for integration?",
        "Good app but UI design stuck in 2013 it seems. better to use material design or something",
        "I find it very stable and very pleasant. Been using it for quite some time now and have no wish to try another."

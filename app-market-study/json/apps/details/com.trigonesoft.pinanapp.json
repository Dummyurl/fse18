        "Does what it's designed for but could be improved I was expecting this app to set a shortcut to the active screen/app so that I could swipe it open whenever I wanted. Instead it is used to keep open whatever app you have in the foreground, even if the screen goes off so it loads up straight away. Useful when you want to save battery and not have to load up the same app time after time but if you could turn the swipe gesture into a sort of favourite shortcut launcher it would be great. The app design otherwise is very neat and good looking.",
        "Works great! Thanks! Awesome work. I'm been looking for this app since I got my Moto 360. It works great for the example of grocery store and always checking your list. I use it when I golf so my rangefinder apps are right there at the front and I don't have to manually get back into the app.",
        "does not work Tried to pin the golf shot app during rounds of golf but it does not work. Screen keeps going back to its default screen after 15 seconds.",
        "Not working 360 Gen 2 42MM Great concept, doesn't allow to pin Google music control, says 'no app' when trying to pin.",
        "Most useful app i have tons of apps on my watch. But this is the only one of its kind app i found on play store. Intelligently executed. Must have.",

        "Very informative",
        "I love it. Didn't have to go to the ER. Very helful!!",
        "There's some explanations on side effects, which is what I am looking for. Also they mention another app that tracks restaurant foods by ingredients such as milk. I want that app, but apparently it is only available for iPhones and I have an Android (Samsung Galaxy S7). Perhaps they will make the app for us Android users asap."

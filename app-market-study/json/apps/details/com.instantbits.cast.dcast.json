        "Not sure why people here say it's better than LocalCast (at least for Chromecasting)... It plays exactly the same files (since it still depends on what the Chromecast supports or not) and the whole UI is still very young compared to the matured LocalCast. Promising though... :) I am still using LocalCast for now."

        "The skip features are good.  Unfortunately it cannot organise files by folder, you have to assign everything to a playlist.  This makes it very hard to deal with large numbers of small files used in language learning, so I'm not going to get the paid app.",
        "Thank you for the demo! Now I'm sure I'm not gonna buy the full version. It wouldn't be that bad. The GUI is a bit chaotic, and it cannot be used for Android Wear as a standalone music player. These are the biggest faults.",
        "Sound good, but i sometimes makes a quick jump while playing a song, I wonder if this is trying to verify the license. I'm using an  android Sony Walkman and I am not connected to the internet. Is this trying to verify a license?",
        "No folder play This app is really good but no option to play from a folder instead of artist etc makes this app totally useless for me.",
        "This trial version looks great! When do we get the full version?",
        "God bless you Been installing, testing, and googling music apps all fμ©&lt;ing day looking for smart playlists. Sanity restored."

        "I LOVE THE BOOKMARKING FEATURE.    I LOVE THE NEW INTERFACE TO GOOGLE DRIVE - THAT IS REALLY SLICK - JUST WHAT I NEEDED!!!!  I LOVE HOW DICTOMATE FOUND A WAY AROUND the Android 4.4 OBSTACLE - GOOGLE CREATED - preventing apps from recording on the extra SD CARD!! I LOVE BEING ABLE TO RECORD PHONE CALLS!!  AND NOW I AM CHANGING MY RATING TO A 5 because the developers just released multi-line descriptors for the NAME of each recording AND for each bookmark!!! WONDERFUL!!  This developer is the most responsive Android developer, I have ever worked with.  THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING APP and for RESPONDING SO QUICKLY to questions and new feature requests!!!",
        "I had an initial problem, but realized it was not the app, it was me! This is an amazing app that I end up using once or twice a week. It works great and I compare it with other apps that I've uninstalled because this one one out!",
        "Overall the app is very good for recording. Excellent recording features. But some of the things completely drive me nuts.  1. No option to change the flippin file naming convention. No matter how good a mobile app is, you will alwaus have to apply some noise suppression and some editing after recording, its a nightmare to find the most recent file by file name. 2. There is an option to save files to SD Card but it does not work. Each time I try, I get an error that SD card is not accessible. Well it is accessible to all the freakin apps in my phone. So every now and then I have to copy the data from internal memory to external. 3. The rename and delete function does not work. 4. Why do you have tiny buttons when you have a large empty space in the recording screen. Why can't you use it for something useful. Show some stats, warn for bad recording, noise, do something for the sake of doing.",
        "I've been looking for a while for an app that uses bookmarks since I got used to them on my old Samsung Note. Recording quality is sound, interface very simple, like the rotate 180Â° to make a bookmark automatically, only thing I wish it had lock screen and notification bar integration. Love the updates! Last one gave me the option to upload my recordings on Google Cloud now so I can listen to them from my PC.",
        "Great app",
        "Awesome Does everything you need it to. Quick and intuitive. Recommended."

        "How do I close it on my g watch? Please answer me, thank you",
        "The most attractive calculator by far Only thing to change if possible, to close the app should only work by long pressing one button not any, because I should be able to long press operations button as long as I want to find which button I want to press. Please fix that to get 5 stars. Thanks dev.",
        "Absolutely Beautiful and well made. Needs moto 360 improvements. Some of the UI is off screen. If this gets fixed I will give this app 6 stars and 3 thumbs up. Great app.",
        "It's clean and beautiful. But too simple and no history."

        "Too many words and numbers. Not a single simple graph. This is very tiresome. Oh, of course, it's got a lot of fun sounds and pictures.",
        "Have downloaded and uninstalled so many different weather apps, lost count. Finally, a keeper.  Like the live sounds, animations as well. Easy and accurate, if having a more extensive weather forecast is for you, this has that too.",
        "Rubbish! Cannot get this app to work. Keeps saying I need a working internet connection ...I can connect to the internet...tried on both 4G and and Wi-Fi",
        "Looks great AND it's based on close (though not always the closest and most relevant) local weather stations and networks. I have asked support for assistance to rectify this error.",
        "I never saw before like this accurate, local and world weather with smart live wallpapers. I love it really. May Allah/God shower his peaceful blessings upon you brothers/sisters. Thanks.",
        "Great weather animation Love it also accurate. I've tried many different weather apps and end up deleting for different reasons.Needless to say I've kept this one"

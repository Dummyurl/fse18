        "I love this app, but I can't use it unless I know the concept of each entry. I need to know I spent 100 dollars on play store apps, or on food. Without that, I can't migrate from Expense Manager. (And believe me, I WANT to migrate to your app because it's beautiful and super promising.)",
        "Gorgeous design but lacks functionality. It is a really promising expense app. I would love to see features like labels, accounts, payment methods, recurring transactions and option to add reminders to planned transactions.",
        "Great but could do a little more I would love to be able to set a spend for a month or set categories for spending, e.g. transport, food and drink, leisure, and that these could be customised to suit the user. This should then allow me to work out how much I spend on transport each week / month. That would be amazing. A widget for quick input would be nice, similar to the Google Keep one where you select the type of note you want to add, then it opens the app. If there is a beta community, please point me at it!",
        "Good Start Although there's some feature missing, this app is beautifully designed and I really love the execution of it's ideas. Looking forward for more features in the future updates !",
        "No categories or labels or anything! which data is more useful: how much do I spend on wednesdays or how much I did I spend on clothes last month? This app gives you the former but not the latter!  Android Wear functionality is limited to ONLY voice input.",
        "How can I import CSV? It looks great. it can export as CSV. but I didn't find a way to import CSV. please fix it"

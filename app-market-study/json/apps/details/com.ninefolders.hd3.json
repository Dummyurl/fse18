        "Best e-mail App I have ever found, period. Bit surprised I had to buy a license for each device I own, never come across that before, but the fact I can colour code my calender entries, exactly as they are in Outlook on my desktop, makes this a winner for me. It walks all over the Outlook App.",
        "The only email app, which can handle folders, collapse and expand them and collect the mails from server as is needed. Doesn't handle iCloud nor Gmail. The settings took some time, but after that OK. The price is a bit high. When in search window you can not mark messages for move to another folder (this is bad).",
        "Love this app. I use emails alot, so definitely worth the $10 for allowing me to do more on the go on my phone, which means less work when I get back to my laptop.     I do have one request: sync the calendar with Gmail. I use both work and Gmail calendars, and like to view them together. Currently only the google calendar app provides this capability. Thanks",
        "Best features of an exchange client app which i was looking for but with one awful negative - painful slow sync with server on my GS8+ which is why you get only 3 stars.  I have followed the recommended fixes for this and even with battery optimization off it is still sloooow not worth the excess quick drain of the battery.  New emails notifications typically 20 minutes late arriving, not appropriate for messaging use where response time matters.",
        "I've tried many: Enhanced, Box, Mailwise, AOSP Email.  And Nine is way better.  Conversations view is good.  Out of office is great.  Tasks, notes syncs.  Suggested contacts toggle on or off.  Calendar sync all.  Everything is beautiful EXCEPT for the horrible drawer icon.  It's atrocious.      Edit:  love the new color in the latest update.  Icon is still ugly though.",
        "I used Type Mail for years before I finally deleted it out of frustration. At one point, it had been the best, but this is vastly superior to Type mail, and every other email app I've tried. The UI is snappy and responsive; options are clear and easy to find; auto-discovery worked for ALL FIVE of my accounts (this left me speechless); and my activesync accounts work as expected. The app has an overall level of polish that is disappointingly rare on Android. Bravo!"

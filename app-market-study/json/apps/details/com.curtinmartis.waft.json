        "Great Great joke!",
        "Seriously Hilarious. Friends loved it. Thanks!",
        "Add more farts! This app is absolutely great and you are a genious, I have given you 4 stars, if you update it with more farts I will go out of my way to give you 5 stars, you could even offer in app purchases for like 99 cents, extra fart packages, burp packages, the \"whistle at girls\" package, queef package. The posibilities are ENDLESS! Thank you, thank you so much",
        "Ok Would be much better if it was louder. I have an HTC One which has good volume but this is pretty quiet on loudest setting compared to any other app I use with sound.",
        "Perfect! Not only is this great to use on people, my pets go crazy when I use it to mess with them!",
        "Waft is awesome! Hands down the best fart app out there."

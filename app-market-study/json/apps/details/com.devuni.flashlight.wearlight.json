        "Yup... makes a white screen on the Gear Live.  It's the best available for that.  Doesn't increase brightness, though, nor have any settings or other features. In the immortal words of Anna Russell, \"Remember the [G1]\"?",
        "Handy app Works on my Moto 360. Was skeptical at first because of the 3 sub par 3 star review, but works quite well. Don't let the negative reviews shy you away from trying this app out.",
        "I hate it And never did work you got to get something work it's terrible it says it works but it never worked it at all",
        "You broke it Why mess with it it has not open light yet.",
        "Has no meaning Why would you offer something what kind of watch is going to have the light all smartwatches already have wife why are you trying to sell people stuff",
        "Useless It doesn't  even give  you directions"

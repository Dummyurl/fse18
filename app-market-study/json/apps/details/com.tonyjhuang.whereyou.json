No one can see your location unless you explicitly grant them your permission (in the form of notification)!This is a very early version of the app, so any feedback would be awesome, email me at tony.huang.jun@gmail.com.ANDROID WEAR: For all of you wearable fanatics out there, simply say 'start whereyou' and you can use the app on your watch just like your phone! Also view your friends' locations, right on your wrist!Also, please DON'T spam your friends. Everytime you click their name, they get a notification. So uhh... be nice.WHEREYOU!!!!! YEAHHHHHHP.S. If you download this app and find out you don't have any friends, I'll be your friend :) My username is tony (edit: not it's not, I keep changing usernames as part of the development process, sorryyyy)* Note: pick carefully, once you choose your username you can't change it without losing all of your friends kekeke (that means uninstall and reinstall)",

        "One of the best out there, however since changing my phone to a Moto G5S it no longer works, it keeps crashing...any suggestions to get it working again !!!!",
        "Just got pricey Used this app for a while, and I can understand why it's now been monetised but at £5.95 it has made me look around at other alternatives as it seems a bit steep.  The free one is a good taster but the pro version might make you look elsewhere by",
        "Great app Like it, I had some problems finding the way to the map of the course. This is a great app, and showing it to my friends they completely agree. A couple of additional users is on it's way.",
        "Stats update Like indeed the update! Very interesting to see your progress in the handicap stats through various seasons. Unfortunately it only calculate your handicap for rounds of 18 holes - 9 hole rounds are not included. I hope you will include this in the next update! :-)  Once again: Thank you for a wonderful and very, very useful app!!!!!!! I don't see the opportunity to rate it more than 5 *....",
        "Great App app does everything any golfer needs.  Developer is also very responsive and open to suggestions.",
        "Getting pretty good. With the more recent updates, it's becoming a pretty good app with some really nice features. It's not too intuitive, but pretty robust."

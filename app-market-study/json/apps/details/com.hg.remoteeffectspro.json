        "Needs work! Frequently crashes on Android Lollipop. Also, when I flag a sound effect that I want to save as a favorite (I'm assuming that's the intended purpose of the flag is) it doesn't save when the app is closed.",
        "Almost what I want Alright this is pretty cool and has some of the sound effects I wanted some of the dog noises and some wolf howls. I have flagged the sounds I want this would be better if you could add a section that just has your flagged sounds also either a one word description of the sounds or the ability to add a description of the sounds.",
        "Crashes on phone and now watch too!! Works fine via my LG Watch R, crashes on my S6. I can select one sound group, when I come out and select another it crashes every time. Could definitely do with improving the different groups and also have a new group for favourites. Update: with G Watch R update, it force closes every time. Won't even load on the watch now! Total rip off that they haven't fixed any bugs amd it's actually gotten worse.",
        "Works ok, however.... It works fine on an LG R. However the app constantly asks me to review privacy settings. Very annoying.",
        "Note 3 crashes App crashes with note 3, didn't even try my moto 360",
        "Never had a problem remote controlling this app from my watch, don't even need to open the app on the phone first. Using a g watch r and a nexus 5 as well as a nexus 6p."

Some may still find it useful. I will possibly replace the app with a more modern looking one at some point. I do have a few ideas but for all intents and purposes, this one is now discontinued.

They are useless. If you need help, please get in touch directly.Lightwaver allows you to control your LightwaveRF Home Automation products. http://www.lightwaverf.comThese are the same products as sold by B&Q but repackaged as Siemenshttp://www.diy.com/nav/fix/electrical/room-controlYou will need:At least one socket, switch or dimmer.The LightwaveRF WiFi link hardware.To use the Android TV functions, you will need an Android TV device running at least Android 5 Lollipop.The hardware needs to be set up correctly. I cannot help you with this but it is not difficult and full instructions come with the hardware. Once set up, it works in the exact same way as the dedicated remote controls. Simply treat the app as a remote control and pair your hardware devices with the software devices in the app. Alternatively, if you exactly match the rooms & devices in the same order as  in the LightwaveRF manager on the web, then there is no need to pair any device, it will work right away (assuming the official app already works)This app does not use the LightwaveRF portal unless you are away from home. It communicates directly with your WiFilink so is much faster.*Why would I use this instead of the official app*- Multiple locations.- SSID detection for routing commands.- Built in Tasker plugin.- Voice control.- Android Wear support- Android TV support- NFC Task Launcher compatibility- Homescreen and lock screen widgets- Designed to be pure Android - Fully customisable icons- To support a home developer.- Backup data to Google Drive- Good developer support.LightwaveRF have not released their heating API to 3rd party developers so there is no way to incorporate heating function. Please complain about that one to them not me. It is out of my hands.",

        "Work in progress I've a legacy control station (and I know all room and device numbers). Unfortunately it's just a gamble to get the assignments right. Worked on one  phone; didn't work out on another phone. Currently daily use is still more inconvenient than the original cocu/kaku app.",
        "Ugly, flawed. Error code appears demanding​ I register my phone with LWRF hub. There's nowhere to do that in the app. Error code persists on-screen even when app closed. Really irritating. Huge ugly icons look like program from Windows 95. Haven't got to use app yet cos of error above. Will review if I ever get it to work",
        "Lightwaverf are idiots. Here is someone doing something positive and proactive to unlock the potential of lwrf hardware. Keep up the good work",
        "Can't set the app up. Had the app on an old phone and how all it does it loads the old data and won't update. Such a shame as this used to work amazingly with Tasker.",

        "A lot of people have different opinions, but they also have different phones and headphones. The app comes with an equaliser you can adjust to your liking, so judging by the headphones that came with my s8+, I'm picky, but I'm happy. If you're unhappy, even with the given adjustments available, then you just came here to make a negative review.",
        "its been buggy lately some of the music  will delete its self and has possible crashing but before than it was working well",
        "Enjoying the app,but could have been better with lyrics ...just can't wait for the updated version... With no ads",
        "Great app easy to navigate nothing fancy just does what I want it to do and that's play music.",
        "I guess it could be better if it have lyrics and the settings of song names.. But its awesome",
        "I think it's a really good app and true to it's word!!"

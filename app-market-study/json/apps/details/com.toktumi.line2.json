        "Initially gave it a 1 star rating as the app was crashing. The support team guided me how to fix the issue and it is working once again. You need to clear your cache, make sure you turn off your automatic backup and restore on the app and then un install and re-install again. That took care of my issue.",
        "I hated it. It frustrates me very much. It is telling me I have a line2 account but I know I very much don't. I hate this app with a passion gave it 1 star. Hated it bye might come back if y'all can fix my account",
        "Love, love my line 2. Have had it for years! Beat deal out there! Try their fax service, beat ever. You can have any phone u have accept line 2 calls. With one phone u have an additional phone line  with line 2.  Line 2 had its own messaging. I have a personal line and a business line on one phone! Great, responsive costumer service!",
        "I've written a review back in 2015 and I'll update it now. This app (and the desktops) are worlds behind any other platform. Messages disappear, app freezes, just a clusterfuck all around. Voice quality on WiFi is good, bad on 3g.",
        "Could not open the app since a update Tried everything - restart, clear memory, reinstall, etc. Spent a lot of time & finally back to normal. Need more testing before updates.",
        "It's OK but it doesn't record calls like the windows app and some of the stuff have to be done thru the computer in order to work in the app. Will continue to test app and update later."

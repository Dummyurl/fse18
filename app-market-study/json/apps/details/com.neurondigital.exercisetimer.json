        "Perfect interval training app. It's really easy to use. You can save heaps of different workouts and they're all fully customizable. The voice calls out what you're doing next so you don't even need to see your phone as your exercising.",
        "Very straightforward app. It is easy to use once you figure it out, but it needs much better instructions.  I use it not as it's developer intended for my morning exercise program.   --&gt;  Since it reads the exercise names out loud, instead of inputting exercise names, I type in what I want the App to say to me. Sort of like having a trainer speak instructions. I edit it a little now and then to make it even better for me.",
        "Just love the app. Reviewing it after using it for almosta year. This have all the options that i require to set the timer. It is so easy and customizable unlike other timer where it has some fixed/confusing/tiresome method to set the time, here one can set the timer for just any kind of exercise or ones own set of exercise wihout any glitches. Two words for the app --&gt; Completely Customizable.",
        "Hands down best workout timer ever I am also able to play my music apps while this is playing. You can also create custom wrkout and work out like a pro at the gym or at home it's like having a personal trainer on your phone",
        "Great timer app but one suggestion, sync with apps like S health and Google fit. Would make exercises in those apps more accurate.",
        "Looks great, works exactly as I want with HIIT stole workouts. I can save as many workouts as I want!"

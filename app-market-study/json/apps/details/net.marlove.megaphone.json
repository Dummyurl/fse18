        "Audio Bluetooth and Input Voice changing would be nice. Love this for MANY creative reasons, While my device is in my vehical charging on USB and either using the vehical bluetooth or other audio input such as Auxiliary, remote start and enable app and speak like a P.A. System. Also great  to troubleshoot my mic on the wear watch.",
        "Great idea The idea of this app is really cool, but for me my Bluetooth version must be outdated because the audio from my watch to phone is laggy. But I contacted the developer and he was really cool about negotiating!"

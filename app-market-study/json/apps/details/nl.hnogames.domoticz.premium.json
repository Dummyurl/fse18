        "Very simple and very efficient domoticz client. Thanks.",
        "Widgets break every time there is an update. So you need to remove all of them and put new ones to your screen every update. Allso they take up a lot of room. Dont need 3x1 just to show a temperature. Make them scalable. Otherwise quite ok app.",

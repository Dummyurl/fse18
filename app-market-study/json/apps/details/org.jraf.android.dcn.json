        "Useful There are a couple of places I visit only occasionally, and I can never remember the door code.  This app will show a notification with the door code when I arrive.  I only wish I had a smart watch to take advantage of the feature of this app which shows the door code on the watch.",
        "Useful Smart idea for those not smart enough to remember codes, or simply because you have too many to recall.",
        "Lovely Nice little app with a lovely UI. At the end, I don't have much need for it but for some people, like the developer who's disabled, it may be really useful.",
        "Nice Handy app!"

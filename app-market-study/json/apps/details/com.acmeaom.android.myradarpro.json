        "Not sure what this \"Star citizen mode\" fix was but it did nothing to fix not opening properly on Android 6.01 note 4. Usually crashes. Give back 5 stars addressed, until then I must use another as this is useless.",
        "Does not load entire view of map alot of it is blacked out have to exit app and reopen to get entire view 1/26/2016 Still does not load entire map only small square rest is blacked out/3-2-2018 Ariel view is just black after last update!!!/3/04/2018 still a black screen after 2nd update!!!",
        "The ability to see the wind and temperature patterns is very real. The northern hurricanes I've been watching were vividly verified in Nova Scotia on Christmas day when one of these swirls parked over Halifax and blew down trees and powerlines. Global warming is all too real.  There is room for improvement with the app but the data is easy to understand and it explains a lot of changes in process with the environment.",
        "Awesome app and one that I have paid for on all my devices.  As a frequent traveler, the aviation layers are indispensable and the new features including airport delays and flight plans is invaluable.",
        "\"Chance of precipitation...\"  How about be specific and mention the type of precipitation like snow, rain, sleet, freezing rain, maybe?  Another update, still doesn't show precipitation type...  I've determined that the developers are idiots.",
        "One button away from viewing Mars? Seriously maybe a 3-5 options in. From time to time I click on the Mars it's stupid!"

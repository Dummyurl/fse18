        "Good, but needs improvements It has a nice clean interface, but lacks captions options for the photos. Also the edit time feature is terrible, limited to few hours before/after the meal. Why? If you didn't take a photo in the morning you just can't take a photo in the evening and adjust the time to fill the gap. Otherwise I really liked: fast, clean, pretty good app.",
        "Camera and tracking good. Improvent opportunities should be examined. Great start. Takes pictures and allows for date editing. Would like to add notes. Form allowing nutritional info entry would be good. Would like to see other ways to review daily and/or weekly food intake. Can't add pic from library to show in group display.",
        "Works ok for the first month Worked ok for the first month, now however the app crashes when ever I try and go back more than a week... It's a great idea, just wish the app worked! DON'T DOWNLOAD now I can't see anything... This has wasted a month of me tracking everything!",
        "i rated it 1 star because of the new update. after i updated it, it just close immediately after i opened it and all my photos seemed to be erased. i rated it 5stars before since i really liked it",
        "I like the simplicity of the app, and that it is not so goal focused. The time input thingy is a bit buggy, else it would get 5 stars. :D",
        "I wanted to try this app... But as I open it crashes"

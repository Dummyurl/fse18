Looks like it is happening to everyone by the comments I have been reading. Shame, it doesn't work, I'd totally dig it.",
        "Amazing I love this app. Kinda unless but pretty cool non the less. Could you try and make it a watch face?",
        "Delayed response that gets longer Doesn't respond in real time, and the longer it runs, the more the delay increases. (Moto 360)",
        "Crashes on lollipop Great app but crashes on moto x 2014 but still runs on moto 360",
        "I like, but it crashes I like the app but it doesn't stay running. It'll crash after 5 min then when I reopen it flickers instead.",
        "So much fun!! I love this app.  Then again, I am a light freak.  Love it.  Thank you for wonderful fun app.  Fully recommend."

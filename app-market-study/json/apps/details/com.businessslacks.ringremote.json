        "smpile, great app üëç thanks for the simple great app. but it have a problem. if the phone  screen is locked it does not change  the sound mode, ex:(from normal to silent). i hope you'll fix that soon and thanks again üòä",
        "Works exactly as described Does exactly what I want to do, which is to toggle the song mode easily from my watch. Only suggestions I have is to be able to view the current state/volume of the ringer, and to be able to control ringer volume as well from the watch.",
        "Almost perfect I think it is almost perfect but I don't know how to close the app on the watch. I just wait for the screen to timeout",
        "It worked great originally, but then stopped.  Probably Android version issue, but on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 with Android 5.1.1, it doesn't seem to work unless the phone is unlocked.",
        "Huawei Watch Works as intended. A slider for the ringtone volume (or all volumes) would make this perfect.",
        "Works Need a setting to turn volume back to full instead of \"normal\".. then it'd be worth keeping"

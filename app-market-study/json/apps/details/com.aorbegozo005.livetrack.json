        "The big failure of this app is that it does not reliably track in the background. When I switch to another app (for example to look at a trail map) it eventually stops running and no longer records the trail nor reports online. In addition the configuration is painful, there are settings and options, and there's a hamburger menu on the left and a 3-dots menu on the right. I've also seen it report a timestamp of 2066-04-08 in the last known info when looking at a real-time track from another device.",

        "It would be a great tool if the times were right. I'm on the platform, the app says the J is pulling in and the M is 4 min away. The board says 12 min for the J and the M isn't even on the board. I can see 4 stops away since we're above ground and there's no train in sight. So this app is basically useless.",
        "The app was so good. Was.. Whatever you did on the most recent update broke live bus timers because my connection on other apps is totally stable and this one keeps jumping in and out of live mode so I never get accurate times. Dont know if this is a Toronto issue or an app wide thing. Either way the app no longer functions for the purpose I downloaded it for.",
        "I use this app for my daily commute. Since I have saved my work and home locations, it's one click to \"go\" and I get alerts! A notification two stops before my stop, and another at my stop. I haven't missed my stop yet! What more do you need",
        "Update: They have dropped the Android Wear app altogether in the newer builds (you can still install it through an old build, if you can obtain one), so had to take a star off the rating, as that was a vital part of personal use of this application.  Previous Review: Great app. Use it mostly on Android Wear. Always have to launch it, close and relaunch it on personal AW watches to get it to properly locate position (that is why this is a 4 star review).  If this issue could be resolved, this is a five star application.",
        "I'm in Montreal and a new user to public transit because of this app. Works like a charm every time! Easy, friendly, accurate, and beautiful visuals. The only thing I would add is a simple option to choose which bus stop to depart from. Sometimes it defaults to a further stop depending on the setting \"minimize walking\". Other than that it is pretty much perfect. As a data person I would love to work for this company!",
        "I love this app! I love that I can get delay notifications and real time updates. It's awesome that I can track the bus or train by seconds. Loved the update that added the ability to order an Uber from the app. This app has truly everything I need, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there is no way to save data or share it on another device. I've had to restore all my locations and notifications again because I switched devices."

        "Awesome app that fools everyone.  The card scroller is top-notch! üòâ  The only issue I can see is maybe have the card appear for a shorter length of time on the watch.  It only  needs to show for a couple seconds.  I am using this app with the invisible deck, and it kills!",
        "Excellent app! So much fun baffling friends and family with this app. The kids are amazed and think I'm magic! And nobody has a clue how it's done. Well done to the developer for promptly fixing the only issue I had with this app, too. Five stars!",
        "Needs more cards",
        "Great idea, needs bug fixes Screen on watch has to be on at time of selection or will now work. Maybe have it so that the screen will not shut off when the app is open."

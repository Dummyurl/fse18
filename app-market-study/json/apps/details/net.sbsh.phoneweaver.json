        "I liked It.  Please add.. It is worth. I use Phone Weaver with Call Weaver for maximum advantages.The proof of pudding is in its eating. Please make possible to enter coordinates for locations. Stable, reliable and trouble free. Location function is more versatile in Easy Profile Pro. I tried most of the other paid similar applications, and found Phone Weaver to be practically useful in every day life. You may also try similar ones- Actions Pro for example. PLEASE ADD MOTION DETECTION TRIGGER with Time delay.",
        "Phone Weaver was the first and, for a long time, only app I purchased for Android. I liked the using the calendar sync (\"Agenda\") to mute/unmute when I was in meetings, and especially the app's ability to turn on wifi when I arrive home - and off when I leave, to save battery. It lost the ability to access any of my location services, and Smart Actions, as awful as it is, seems to work more reliably for the things that it does. I sent an email to Sesma support, and the person who responded seemed to be trying to tell me how to turn GPS on, in my device; provided no other options. (I know how to turn on all my location services.) If location access is restored this will get 5 stars.",
        "Tired of the inconsistency I've been using this app for a few years.  In the beginning it was good, but lately it's unreliable.  In particular, honoring the priority of my profiles such that a Bluetooth connection profile should always override the default Day profile doesn't always work.  I'm going to look for a new app.",
        "Used to be good... Now it's just plain unstable...  I love this app. I've had since Samsung Note first appeared on the market. I've always kept it installed as I upgraded phones. It worked great on my Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 but recently on my Nexus 6 and recent Android updates it's lost its stability.  The phone basically locks up when switching to navigation when I'm in my car. Instead of making it easy for me to answer calls, view my maps and send and receive text via voice commands it pretty much becomes inoperable. I have to reboot, disable the app, set my screen timeout to the max... all while driving to my destination.  Sorry Phone Weaver but I had to uninstall you. Unless they fix the app I'll have to look for an alternative. :(",
        "A must have for me Everything you could ask for is already built-in. Seems that support has ended, which is a shame. Great app! Consistently works, where others do not. Lightweight, easy on battery, but best of all you set it and forget it. It always works!",
        "The best profile manager While this used to be the best, there have been no updates in over a year and it has become unstable. Profiles not switching correctly, rules not being followed and not backing up fully. Email just sent to dev, but I'm not expecting a response."

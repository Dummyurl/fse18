        "I enjoy using this app. Maybe some previous versions didn't work well, but this one is really great. I really enjoy the widget for Android. I feel like I finally know what's going on in Orlando. $7.99 / month is totally worth it to keep in touch with the community. I already pay $15 / month for the NY Times, so I think this is reasonable. If we want quality journalism in the city we love, we should expect to pay something for it.",
        "The notifications are not overwhelming, always interesting and it's easy to navigate through the articles to find topics of Interest.",
        "Sucks...only 5 stories a month. All about $",
        "What a pathetic excuse for an app. A corp. this large should be able to afford to get a news app to work. uninstalling and will get my news from a more reliable app. What a shame.....",
        "Story links slow to respond or does not respond in EVERY session! Occurs on multiple phones. All others apps work fine.",
        "I wasn't happy they wanted to charge $7.99 to extend the article, to read more news when u could get news others source then it was 10 free story  for a month now they went to 5 I'm going to delete this apps very very very disappointing fail to hear the people just got creedy smh"

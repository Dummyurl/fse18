        "I don't understand WHY you have to type in a monstrously long URL into your phone to get this to a wearable.   IF you don't have to do that....then HOW DO you get new RSS feeds into the phone to send to the wearable?    I don't see any \"help\" button on this app.   I'm willing to pay for this, but right now I don't see it's usefulness.  All I can get is the 3 sample feeds.    Surely... surely, you've made it easier than this.  I'm looking for the \"grab RSS  feeds button' so I can go to a site and grab the URL",
        "Works well with Wear Given that the BBC news app doesn't work on my Huawei watch,  I went looking for an alternative. RSS seemed like a good approach.  Tried others which were problematic and chose this little gem. Works well on my wearable.  Love it.",
        "Doesn't synch automatically The app is perfect and does exactly what I wanted. The only problem is I even though I have it set to sync every three hours, have to sync it manually by going on to my phone. I'm using the LG urbane watch.",
        "Unfortunately wearrss has stopped working For the last time!   Really nice app but needs to work on reliability, roughly 70% of the time when opening from the notification, it just gives the error and shuts down.  Uninstalled. Sony z3 & moto 360 1st gen",
        "App keeps crashing Just bought the app bundle for android wear. Every time I try to add a feed, the app crashes. I would like a refund please. If it worked it would awesome, but it doesnt",
        "Great way to read news I would like to see an option to dismiss news you have already read. At the moment there is no way to get back to the first article without swiping 20+ times"

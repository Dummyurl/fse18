        "Brilliant app! Great for controlling the laptop when it's plugged into the TV and not too expensive. It does seem to have problems every once in a while and once it's open it won't close, unless I restart my phone! A minor convenience but still annoying.",
        "This used to work so amazing for me I bought the pro version straight away. Somewhere within the last 6 to 9 months something must have changed on their end. Now can never connect to WiFi no matter what I try. Now I'm forced to use a competitors app instead because it works without error. Sad. :(",
        "Great app, use daily for controlling my mess mix match of Kodi, wmc & potplayer.   It saves me having to move for 30 min to an hour at a time.  Highly recommended.  Would love to see a skinning feature.  Good work developer!",
        "It does the job, but the interface could certainly use some improvements.  For instance the right click and, drag and drop on the mouse control are very hard to use compared to the Gmote app.  Also, the VLC control forces you to use a hard coded password.  Still needs some refinement.",
        "Has been great for what it is. Really badly needs a middle mouse click function. Other than that there is room for improvement in a few places but not many of them matter much. It's still not a replacement for anything hardware wise.... But it does feel like it comes kinda close sometimes.",
        "Great app but, i never managed to use widgets in a stable manner. Even now after many smartphones, android versions, app versions, i am not able to have a working widget setup. App crashes, i loose all the widgets, create again widgets, they stop working and so on. and after a while a bother again and then same issues. kind of annoying"

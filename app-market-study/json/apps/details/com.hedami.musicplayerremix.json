        "I bet that I could get a free music player that works better than this one. First, it plays the same songs everyday. I walk 1-2 hours and hear about 50% of the same songs everyday, I have 800 songs on my phone and like everyone of them. Second, when you try and fast forward to the next song you didn't hear the day before it gets stuck on one song and takes me 5 minutes to find the  main menu to switch back to shuffle, which sucks while you are trying to get some exercise. Third, why did they hide the main menu, I have a Samsung S7 Edge and have a heck of a time trying to find the menu to reset my shuffle.",
        "Excellent music player One of my favorite apps. Easy to use, lots of different functions and does far more than other music players. There is a trial version if you're unsure, but when you play around with it you'll more than likely want the full version. Love the 5, 30, 60 second rwd/ffwd feature and that I can open it over other apps.",
        "Great player but the functionality is worsening This app was amazing when I first got it, until the shuffling got reworked and started shuffling your entire playlist instead of randomly selecting a track from the alphabetically ordered library. You can still get it to work properly if you load up your entire library and then manually change the playlist to shuffle, but that's far from ideal while on the road, and worse still it seems to still play the next consecutive track before actually shuffling. Lyrics broke a while back too. Used to be 5/5. 😧",
        "TERRIBLE Chromecast Support Playing music via Chromecast does NOT work properly. Every time I try to play a song from an artist that has multiple songs, it point blank refuses to play that particular song and instead runs though every other song by that artist in quick succession with no music playing until it reaches the last song and just plays that instead. It ONLY does this when connected to my Chromecast Audio. This needs fixing ASAP.",
        "Screen go's black have to restart and no lyrics at all. While using the app the screen will go black and I have no control at all. After restart it will work fine for a while. Also since I installed I have been unable to get any lyrics to download. Been a long time user of your app, WebOS days, nice work on this version. Device is an S6.",
        "Only one thing to make it perfect This app is fantastic, the only problem, and it's a pretty big annoyance, is that when on random it will play the same song many times on a playlist and never hits all of them. I wish it was programmed to play every song once on random. You can only hear the same song repeatedly on a run so many times before it slowly drives you insane."

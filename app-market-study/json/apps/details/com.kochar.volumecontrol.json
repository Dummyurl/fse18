        "Transparency I love the app with a couple of suggestions.  First,  the volume adjustment could stand to have more fine adjustment if possible.  Seems like changes are a bit too abrupt. Secondly,  if you could increase the transparency or do something to keep the notification from substantially blocking the clock.  I listen to podcasts for many hours and I'd rather be able to see the clock.",
        "Works great. Could be even cleaner though. I like the app as it seems to do what it's supposed to and the controls are good. I'm not sure I like the grey background though. I'd rather have a more clean version without that background or with a solid color. The current image just ends up looking low-res and a bit boring.",
        "Good but not perfect On my LG R, it does not remember the volume position i set. So every time i open the app on my watch it shows like it's muted, even though it's playing loudly. Also the volume button could be easier to use, cause when it's at minimum i often end up closing the app (by swiping) then changing the volume.",
        "Not the top app? Sure needs a little improvement but actually works better than any other volume control app for my Nexus 5/ Moto 360.",
        "Bummer I'm looking for a volume control for my Onkyo app.  This doesn't work.",
        "Works great Works great, I just wish the UI picked up some material design cues. To me, it looks a bit dated. But hey, it is very functional."

        "Love the app and have had very few problems with it. It's useful to monitor engine codes,  driving styles,  and the idiots on the road around you. The problems are clarity of image and exposure.  I have difficulty reading license plates (auto focus issue? Not sure what the difference is with the 3 auto focus settings) when reviewing images to report carpool violators and the manual adjustment for tint is impractical in changing conditions.  When it's cloudy and there is a sun break the image ends up washed out badly and I don't think this adjustment should be messed with while driving.   Would buy again",
        "I do like the video capability and features of the app. I have an issue with the OBD2 connection and the fact that when I sent the log information in via the app, the email was bounced back. If I connect the app to the OBD2, as soon as the app boots into the video screen the engine dies.",
        "I cannot seem to be able to disable event detection sensativity, it is set very low but every time I hit even a small bump in the road it records emergency video also the GPS does not match the recording if I'm stopped it shows the vehicle moving several seconds before it actually starts.",
        "Very good. Excellent all rounder, saves having a dash cam app and OBDLink running at same time. Only issues is white balance whilst recording is either non-existent or extremely slow. I'd also like a widget with even just 2 buttons, one to return to app and another to protect recording, the floating button is to small to safely use. If it had a parking mode also, THAT would make it a top 3 app. Awesome work! Highly recommended, and don't skimp out and buy the pro version!",
        "I've had this for over a year. It is a solid app, doing what it says on the box although it is a little flakey when confronted with cheap Bluetooth ODB II devices. Sadly, it don't work no more. It and Android O (8.0) don't get along.",
        "Works great after tweaking the settings a little. E.g. focus set to infinity, after finding the AF1 and AF2 getting confused when raining. Great app."

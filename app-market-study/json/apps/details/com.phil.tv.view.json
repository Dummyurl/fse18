        "Connection is a gamble at best. Even if my TV is found and displayed as connected, pressing a button will give me a not connected error. But then occasionally it decides to work again. Too unreliable to want to keep using.",
        "Utter garbage, first thing you see when you open the app is an advertisement. Didn't detect my TV and when it did the buttons did not work.",
        "Doesn't work as all other comments state. Won't connect to TV even with manual IP address entry. Developer should maybe read comments, contact users and try to remedy issues.",
        "This app doesn't detects my TV , and I put manually the IP and it supposedly detected it but when I tried to press any button, it appeared a message saying that my TV and my mobile should be connected to the same wi-fi and they are connected to the same one.",
        "It doesn't work except for the volume buttons. And this TV wont work with my PC which is one of the reasons I spent so much on a \"art\" TV",
        "Doesn't work! Even typed in my opinion manually. Says TV detected, when I press button, says connect to the same network. I am on the same network too. Horrible app"

        "Works Perfectly Downloaded this on a whim.  Tried it for the first time today on the drive home from work.  Matched my vehicles speedometer within 2-3%,  Cool app that really only has utility when you can't get speed from an embedded readout (speedometer).  Will be useful when skateboarding, running, boating, etc.    Thanks Dev!",
        "Great App Dear Speed Wear 65 developer. I like the application for high performance sailing. I would be so much better however if you could provide speed in tenth of units (knots in my case). thank you.",
        "Great app! I really like your speedometer app, it is one of the few that has knots as units. Could you add an option for the app to show extra decimal places? Id like to use the app for sailing, but I need it to display 1/10ths of a knot (or even 1/100ths). Also if you added an option to display the latest GPS heading on my watch that would be perfect!"

        "A very informative app based on your selected (favourite) tech topics/interests. Mostly I like that you can set the reading settings to night mode so that it's easy in the eyes as well as change the text size if I remember correctly. I've downloaded this app since day and on every new android device I've ever had and will have; for me this is an app worth having n' it's staying. If you're into all things tech this app is a must have :)",
        "I like this app a lot. I am very interested in the tech sector and this is such a useful tool to keep updated! It gives you a lot of options for topics to follow for your personalized section. They have the main screen that has various topics. You can search for different topics (ex. technology) or different companies (ex. Google) or types of objects (ex. phone) or specific objects (ex. Google Pixel) or operating systems (ex. Android). Underneath the search it has breakdowns if you would like to further search your term to get more specific articles. You can save articles for later. You can \"react\" to articles which helps the app know what to recommend for you to read. You can adjust notification settings a lot, which I appreciate. I haven't had any issues with the app so far. Great app!",
        "I had to change my review from 5 stars to 3 for 3 reasons. The positive side, that's my go to tech news app.. negative side, been a few months i get a notification that I can view new articles but when I open the app it's the old one and doesn't refresh to the new one. 2, it used to read the articles but doesn't anymore. 3, I contacted the developer by email but it was failed to send cause the developer's email was wrong!",
        "All my favorite news feeds in one app! BUT, I keep getting article in different languages that I have to copy/paste into translate to be able to read. Since this app has no copy capability, I have to pull my S pen out and force it to select and copy text.",
        "It's awesome so far and I have had it for like 3 mos. Has tons of story's and news on a variety of tech topics from lots of awesome News Sources. Have had no problems at all once I got signed in and completed my profile all the way. I had a tiny bit of trouble only the very first day I got this but that was all due to my own confused self lol. You can even use Appy Geek as your screensaver on your phone. It's awesome!  Thanks guys for the app an all your hard work on it.",
        "Tells me everything I need to know for the tech I have. Sales, updates, changes, new products. UI is silky smooth too. Update: this app is better than ever! Can we please have an alternative to FAKEbook for commenting within the app? Thanks!"

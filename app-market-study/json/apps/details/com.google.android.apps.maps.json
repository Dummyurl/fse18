        "Certain places it will lose signal. Need to have the start and end time option like the browser version. Would be nice to have a feature that calculate the shortest route among stops. Need to have an option allowing no highway routing because sometimes highway is super congested so going local is faster",
        "Google maps works great! I love that it shows you which lane you need to be on when you're getting ready to exit the interstate or make a turn in a busy city. Thus is very helpful when you don't know where you're going. The only improvement I would make is to allow drivers to report on traffic, accidents, etc, like Waze. This would get the info to Google maps faster than getting it from Waze."

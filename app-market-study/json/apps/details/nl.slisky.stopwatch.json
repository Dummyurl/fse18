        "Edit: Working as designed now. Uninstalled from phone and watch. Reinstalled. Working. Simple design that works well so far. Would love to see a timer / interval timer added to the app as well.   Seems to work on the phone. Can't get past the first screen on the watch though. Also, every time I open the app I get the tutorial pages again.  Tutorial is on the phone. And its a Ticwatch S with Android Wear 2.8. Would love to be able to use this.",
        "Great app.  'X' symbols halfway outside the screen in light theme. Buttons in cards theme are better on the lower side. Please give option for  changing font color  and it would be nice if the delete symbol is scaled down a bit. ðŸ˜Š",
        "I couldn't believe how poor the stopwatch selection was for Android Wear coming form a Pebble. Something basic like laps missing was a deal breaker and if you left the app up you couldn't tell the time. This app fixes those basic problems. I still wish there was one stop watch and timer app with even more functions, but this is more than adequate and better than the stock option. Being able to change the lap from the card and not opening the app is very handy.",
        "Thank you. This is by far the BEST stopwatch app for Android wear.",
        "Awesome app for runners. Great for interval training. Simple to use and u can export the lap times. Thanks!",
        "Best stopwatch for Android Wear The default Wear stopwatch has major issues when running - it doesn't stay on screen, the card for it doesn't remain at the top of the pile, and there are no start/stop controls from the card. Basically it's useless for timing things with any degree of accuracy. This app fixes all that, looks better and backs up the results. Should be the standard for all Wear devices!"

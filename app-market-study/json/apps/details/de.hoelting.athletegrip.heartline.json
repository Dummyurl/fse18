    "description": "This app supports planning and analysis of a training session in the simplest manner.The recognized indicator for the physical strain which is used is the heart rate (pulse). This is determined by means of a cardio chest strap, and is then communicated to the app via Bluetooth 4.0 LE. The app analyzes the pulse data and calculates the average, maximum, minimum and differential values of the current training session. In addition, the GPS distances* and GPS speed* are also calculated. After completion of the training session, the entire training process can be analyzed in detail and, based on the results, the next training session can be planned and stored as a training plan. An external analysis of the data is possible via the data export function.That way, it is possible to establish a closed loop between planning, execution and analysis.The app includes the following features:Analysis- Analysis diagram differential pulse analysis – 0 to 0.3 pulse beats per second -> steady training process- Analysis diagram pulse over time- Analysis diagram pulse limit exceededPlanning- Creation of a timer-based training plan – duration of a partial session, min. and max. heart rate- Execution of the training plan, with storage of the following values:Time PulseAverage PulseGPS speedAverage GPS speedGPS distanceAlarm- Min./max. alarm parameters for heart rate   - Vibration and audio signal for violation of the heart rate frequency limit  - Vibration and audio signal for re-entering the target heart rate frequency rangeDisplay- Current heart rate, average and max./min heart rate - Times of optimum heart rate and times when heart rate limit was violated- GPS distance*, GPS speed*, and average GPS speed*PrerequisitesAndroid 4.3+ Phone with Bluetooth 4.x LE (SMART) Tested with:- Sony Smartwatch 3 + Polar H7 + GPS- Motorola Moto 360 + Polar H7 - LG G Watch R + Polar H7 - Nexus 5 + Polar H7 (Android 5)- Nexus 5 + BeetsBlu Bluetooth SMART - Nexus 5 + Arendo chest strap BeetsBlu Bluetooth SMART- Nexus 5 + Tchibo chest strap Bluetooth SMART - LG G-Pad + BeetsBlu Bluetooth SMART - LG G-Pad + Tchibo chest belt Bluetooth SMART - Samsung Note II + Kitkat 4.4.2 + Polar H7 - Samsung Note II + Kitkat 4.4.2 + BeetsBlu Bluetooth SMART - Samsung Note II + Kitkat 4.4.2 + Tchibo chest strap Bluetooth SMART * GPS data are subject to certain variations, depending on meteorological conditions, location and environment.Due to this, significant deviations are possible. The best measurements showed a deviation from the actual distance and speed of 1%. Normally, deviations between 1% and 5% can be expected.

        "Works well with smart watch 3 Gives heart rate on the watch without the phone direct from mio band which is excellent. Cant understand watch display. Instruction would be nice. Youtube help video has fault and will not play on anything. Hence only 4 stars. Still v good to see pulse on watch. Deadly accurate as well.",
        "Terrific - and works with Mio Alpha Best app I've found to work with my Mio Alpha heart rate monitor. It connects easily, holds the connection - and is the only app I found that doesn't need wifi turned off to hold a bluetooth connection to the heart rate monitor.   Nice graphical displays too for the current workout. Pity you can't save and view workouts (only export raw data) but it's so much better than everything else I tried (including Mio Go) that I still think it's worth 5*.",
        "Took me over two hours to figure out it doesn't work with either my Runtastic Bluetooth OR my Polar Bluetooth heart rate straps AND it doesn't work with either my Pebble Time OR my Gear2 watch. Too late for a refund. It's not that $2.65 is going to break my budget, but I feel abused and taken advantage of. I checked for a free version before I purchased but didn't see one. So I bought it. When I went back to check for a refund, the refund button was gone, but NOW the free version shows up as an option. Pfffgt."

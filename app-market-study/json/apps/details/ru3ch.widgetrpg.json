        "I was wondering why the game wasn't showing up in the widget. And then I realized that the widget is supposed to be an ugly little thumbprint, and the actual game takes place in the app which you have to manually open, making the widget completely redundant. I'm sure the game is fun but why bother with the widget element if it's executed this stupidly?",
        "I can't believe that this game only has 100thousand downloads it should be way more than that. Thanks for the great game",
        "Its good",
        "Hated it",
        "This game had really surprised me the first time I've played it. Why? Because you have so much things that you can find...and you don't have nothing to do apart from clicking a bunch of times on a simple button!",
        "Nagyon jó kis játék, azt hiányolom belőle, hogy pl a science pontokat fel lehetne használni új dolgok kikutatására, stb. Amúgy egész jó."

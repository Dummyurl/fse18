        "Great app! I do have some suggestions, however. Could you add a dedicated fractions button? Like the one they have in those TI-30Xa calculators? Its so useful, and very difficult for me to stick with a calculator that doesn't have this option (which, for whatever reason, is most). Add that and you'll definitely get that fifth star.  Also, it can be a little tedious swiping that extras-pane-thing very often. Could you try what GBoard does (if enabled)? Show the special characters behind the regular qwerty characters, sort of like a superscript. Than make it so that tapping and holding a character will be tapping a special character.  For example: long-tapping the 'd' gives me a '$' in GBoard, and I would like it so that long-tapping the '=' gives me 'X' in this Calculator. I don't think that this should replace the pane, but I would love to enable this in settings or something. Thanks for the great calculator, I hope you keep working on it! (Or Google buys it, lol)",
        "Best app ever.. No need of pressing the equal button. Automatic answer. You guys are doing great. I would like to get more app from you."

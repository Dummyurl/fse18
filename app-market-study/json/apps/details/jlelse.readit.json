        "Clean, clear, wide-ranging news For a broad range of news, I can't imagine finding better. NO ADS - thank you so much! Some will say the interface isn't pretty or decorative enough for them, but I don't care about that. It's pleasant to look at, uncluttered, simple.",
        "Very good app ..But the developer made too much features that normal people find difficult to comprehend ..If he change this apps design to something like feedly or Google news etc people will like more I believe..",

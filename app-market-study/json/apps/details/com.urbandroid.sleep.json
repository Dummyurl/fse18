        "UPDATE: Now it looks like it's hacking. I've NEVER instigated sleep record but I got a notification this afternoon asking if I slept between (time X) and (time Y) and wanting me to create a sleep record!!?? Pressing Cancel did hide this but it did not get rid of it. And Devs, please don't respond with your generic BS Auto-response, it just proves how useless you are. PREVIOUS: This app is supposed to be able to sound the alarm even when the Do Not Disturb function is active on the phone. It does  not. In the app I have everything checked to enable it to override the Do Not Disturb function and on my phone, from the Settings menu I have allowed this app to override the Do Not Disturb function but still not a single sound.",
        "Great app.  my sleep has improved. Easy to use. It replaced Ambio app and an alarm program I had on my phone.  Worth the money, a Great investment for anyone with trouble sleeping. Alarm wakes you close to desired time. Reason being it does so when you're in the lightest stage of sleep instead of rem. This way you don't wake up feeling groggy. Alarm starts quietly and builds so you're not startled. You can use your own sounds for the alarm as well.",
        "Been using this app since my very first smartphone. Works brilliantly! One thing I can't figure out is how the Smart Period works. I set it to the default 30 minutes but, I'm always woken up 30 mins. early every time! Never on time. Being up early is fine and dandy but, sometimes I wish it'd let me sleep a proper 8 hrs., not 7 1/2!",
        "I have been using this app for years.  The smart period wake up feature and the crescendo/vibration alarm soft start are very effective for not feeling drowsy in the morning. Even on nights when I get less than 4 hours of sleep I am able to wake up fresh.  If you have any trouble waking up in the morning, try this app!",
        "I subscribe already, also pay for using extra features for up to 5 devices how u saying in desc. Unfortunately it's hidden features. Why u can't makes thinks easy. I understand everything is about money but in this u not make much more but only negative experience your already customers. I can only suggest to change this little option which one is not worth to be reached by more customers. Of course if I see any progress change my ffeedbacj. Otherwise app is so great for me very like.",
        "I love this app. It looks good, it's easy to use, the alarms actually wake me up, and I love being able to track and rate my sleep every night.  The only thing I'd comment on is the sleep deficit. I'd like to be able to set a range of acceptable hours of sleep - that way if I go under *or over* it is noted."

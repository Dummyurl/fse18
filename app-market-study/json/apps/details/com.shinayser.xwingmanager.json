        "Hey there! Thank you for creating this app. I have nothing to say, that isn't mentioned in previous comments, and actually I think that most of the things said are already fixed, as I cannot see them. The only thing, and it's really a small one, that buggers me a bit, is Ezra on the Sheathipede. He is with pilot skill 5, but the app displays it as PS 3. Other than that, everything is absolutely awesome. Keep up the good work! Cheers!",
        "Good little app, too many & big adds and I'm not spending Â£7 to remove them. Try a 99p level.  Edit to Response: Apologies did not meant to upset, your app is very good and I usually buy apps to remove adverts as they drain battery etc but the price is a little steep. Totally your prerogative to price how you see but this will limit your customer base as what kid/young adult has that kind of money to use when a pen and paper or other free app will suffice. Keep up the good work and you effort is appreciated, I only wish there was a more realistic minimum, see other apps mate not many are that steep... Rating increased to show support :-)",
        "Would like to see a reference card tab please and thank you.  This is the best squad builder app for x wing. All the other ones don't come close. Would have actually paid a dollar or two for it. Would like to see the rest of the pilot cards for the tie silencer, and rest of the other new waves. Also an iPhone compatible... Definitely charge the iPhone users lol",
        "I'm not sure if I like this app being collection-based because I like to build squads of ships I don't have, but I still think the interface is awesome.",
        "Great App to track what units I have. Can also add cards to my collection that I was able to obtain from trades, ect.",
        "Hands down, the best X-Wing Squad Builder on Android.  Cannot recommend highly enough."

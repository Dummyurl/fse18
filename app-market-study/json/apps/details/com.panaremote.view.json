        "After trying the panasonic apps without success, this app worked fine. Only criticism is that my phone has to be turned horizontally.",
        "Seriously, what's with all the ads?? Why do I have to watch stupid and annoying ads just to use a remote! Pathetic!",
        "Slim and very simple. I do miss some few keys for my TV. But overall very happy. With no missing keys it will be a 5/5 for me",
        "The only thing I don't like, besides the ads, is that I can't use this unless the TV is turned on. It will turn the TV off but not on.",
        "It's the perfect remote I was looking for",
        "Bad remote, very slow..."

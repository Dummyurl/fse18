        "A life saver! This is the best notifier app I have found so far. ONE REQUEST: save/restore option to save all customizations. Would be very useful when switching to a new phone and not having to enter all the custom snooze times etc that I set up",
        "I rely on this daily for active calendar reminders. Terrific app!",
        "Works well. It would be great if we could customize the look of the alert screen.",
        "This app helps me miss fewer appointments. Hey, since Android 8, I perceive it can use a lot of battery. Can you double check?",
        "Exactly what I needed to catch all my reminders.",
        "This is a great app -- particularly if you are forgetful as I am. I read some of the bad reviews and without exception I believe folks aren't using it properly. It does not 'take over' and it is not intrusive if you're using it right.  C'mon people -- it's worth the effort to study the settings! I've used it for a couple of years now and it has never disappointed.  I contacted the developer Roberto about giving the option to disable toast messages. Within a few hours he had issued a software update! Now this app is perfect! Thanks Roberto!"

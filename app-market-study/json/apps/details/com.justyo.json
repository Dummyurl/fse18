        "Worked fine for all of 5 seconds then I try to log out and log back in it wouldn't allow me I then tried creating a new profile when I click to sign up it told me I was in entering  incorrect password.   How high hopes but I'm frustrated beyond all belief. Please help!",
        "Love it. Please add..... Wow. So simple! While initially mocked, I think you'll find that \"Yo!-ing\" is a much more efficient way of asking someone whats going on. I truly enjoy this app. While this is the case, due to the initial mocking reviews that were written, I am having difficulty getting friends to sign up. Please add the functionality to send \"Yo\" to a cell phone contact. Thanks guys!",
        "iOS Version Is Better I really like the app, but my friend uses an iPhone and the app on there is much better designed.  I would love it if the apps were more similar.  Also, I would LOVE it if that horrible \"yo\" voice was not included at all or at least less annoying.",
        "Wow amazing.  You ever get home from work and your like thinking about someone and dont really want to talk to them? Just send them a Yo and they'll know your thinking of them...or like after a hard days work and you come home and your sitting there and just hear Yo! Puts a smile on my face 10/10 would yo again.",
        "Yo is great in concept, but needs work This app is great, but right now, it's small. More third-parties need to adopt it. Oh yeah, and yo:// links don't work. Fix that... Please.",
        "Thank you for listening Had loads of problems, the app didn't work, and they've fixed everything"

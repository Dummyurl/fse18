        "Doesn't work on a HTC Don't bother if u run a HTC, not worth the hassle. No big deal as I forecast no snow for 2014, no widget required.  Upon install widget was automatically placed on home screen, from there it continues to prompt me 2 place it on homescreen. WTF",
        "Winter funfacts... SnowCell is great. Works well on my galaxy note 2. Since it is an Australia-only widget, would you consider a adding an off-season \"temporary disable\" option so I can stop it auto-updating itself until next winter without having to uninstall it...?",

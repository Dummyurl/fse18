        "I bought the Automatic OBD Device last year and kept getting prompted with the advertisement of the Find My Parked Car app.  So I tried it.  It worked for a while using the free version.  So I decided to buy the licensed version.  I did and now it doesn't automatically detect where I'm parked.  I read the advertisement and it said that I had to press a button to save my parking location.  I never had to to that before, and now after pressing the button the app still doesn't save my location.  The advertisement also says that it automatically detects where you park.  This is not true!!  The app shows where my phone is located (on which the app is running).  What is more frustrating is that the app shows a car picture as to indicate where I've parked.  Moreover, the advertisement says that it will prompt you to save the location.  I have yet to see a prompt even when I have it set in the settings to prompt me.  I'm so disappointed that I paid for the app.  I want a refund.",
        "Great app.  One of the few that lets you manually relocate your parking location.",

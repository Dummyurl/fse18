        "Made a purchase through the app a month ago and have been left in tbe cold by Fancy and the vendor. No response to my email to either the vendor or the courier and Fancy do not have an easy means of contacting them. Out of pocket and very annoyed. Would not recommend making purchases through this app",
        "Addictive scrolling, but kinda buggy. Also, wish I could get back to where I was without starting from the very beginning. Nice, clean UX, though, so no regrets.",
        "Fun app",
        "useful for exploring products",
        "Amazing prices awesome items. Too good to be true, mostly. That's cause most as not true. I purchased an item and waiting a very long time for it to arrive. It had not arrived I contacted support and provided a full refund. The app needs regulators or monitors to thoroughly filter the scam artists out. Good luck. Thanks for my refund, and friendly support.",

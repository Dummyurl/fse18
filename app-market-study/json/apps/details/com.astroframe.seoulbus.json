        "The app lets you look at bus routes and oncoming buses to your stop, and see buses moving in real time.   However, it doesn't let you plan your current location and desired destination and time (!!). Also, the only method of searching for your bus stop is through your stop number, so if you don't know it, you will need to search it up with a maps app or go to the stop yourself and note down the number.  That being said it is an overall messy app to use and needs a lot of work.",

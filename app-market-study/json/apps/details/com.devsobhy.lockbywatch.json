        "One of its kind that can wake the phone through the watch right now. Other apps are just locking. This one has both. There is one before like the WOCK that can unlock the phone but it removes the function on its update. So i can't wait for your update, You know the bypassing lockscreen part. So thanks a lot for making this wonderful  app. Like others said, This is what we are waiting for..,",

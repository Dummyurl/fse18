        "just keep saying phone not found. No support to help me resolve the issue. very disappointed, uninstalling!",
        "I use this app almost exclusively when watching TV on Roku now when doing chores around the house. It's never failed to work once. Dependable! Practical! User-friendly! Really great smartwatch app.",
        "Doesn't even read my Roku worst possible app I've ever had and I wish I could get a half hour of my life back wasting the time of downloading it",
        "Very handy app. Even works on wear 2.0. when I'm on the phone I can pause or turn off my Roku. One of my favorite apps.",
        "Wow. Really? This app is for a '5 minute free trial.\" After 5 minutes, the app purposefully delays the command sent to your Roku so you have to wait a few seconds before anything happens. Even with the dumb delay, it still didn't work. Garbage. Uninstall."

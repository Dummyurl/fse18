Selectable color theme.Instruction1. Enable GPS.2. Read measured value.\tReference- To receive GPS signal, handset must be set under the open sky.- Use the open sky to receive GPS signal. Not be used in the indoor.- Can cause signal distortion in places such as skyscrapers or around the wooded place, the measurement error can be turned.- Depending on the surrounding environment, it may take some time to Initial start-up of the GPS.- General environment rather than in a special environment (Example: skydiving, measure the height of the projectile, alpine climbing, flying height measurement etc.) that is not suitable.",

        "It seems I have to add the location manually. I would much rather the complication updated to my current location automatically.    Update 30th Jan  I see developer responded to my review feedback quickly but not to this question I raised by email.   I still have the same issue. I expect when I arrive in the next city, in this case Los Angeles, the wear weather app will continue to show the city I was in and not update itself to the location of my \" current location\"   I do not want to manually define a location or intervine, I simply want the app to show me the weather of my current location.   Can you confirm this is possible? In which case I am doing something wrong and need help, or this is a working as designed.",
        "I purchased the full version of this app and I recently bought a new phone and now I lost the version that I purchased I only have the standard i would have gave it no stars because of that.......so now money is lost",
        "Not the best weather app on my watch it shows that it's 32°F when it's actually 16°F. I'll give it 5 ☆ when this issue is resolved. Until then 3☆ is the best I'll give.",
        "glitchy. Does not work",
        "You want me to pay the upgrade so I can change weather settings from Celsius to farenheit?? Good luck no wonder your rating is so low lol. Uninstalling",
        "At first fantastic app but now won't work on my casio wsd f20. Tried reinstalling but it just sits loading and never shows the weather page. Paid for the full app so this is very disappointing."

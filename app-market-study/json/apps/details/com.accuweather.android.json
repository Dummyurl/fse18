        "The radar should be full screen and could be better. I'm spoiled from my old weather app from WYFF Greenville channel 4. That radar was GREAT! That is the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars",
        "Nice app so far and pretty accurate.  It doesn't know my home location so the weather is from the nearest village a mile away.  We're a lot higher up than them so the weather tends to be worse.",
        "It would be good if it was actually accurate lol. Also just too laggy for  me. I feel like the ppl that make this app don't care about quality",
        "After the latest Android update the widgets stopped working and the app crashes because of that. The app crashes also when i want to open the details of hourly forecasts. It had to happen when i'm now traveling to a city under a snowstorm?! Fix it asap please.",
        "The one feature I like the most about this app is the rain prediction, telling me exactly when the rain is going to start and stop it's pretty accurate considering!",
        "It doesn't update every half hour, like I requested in my settings. I have to open the app for the temperature to update in my status bar. It decided what my favorite city was, and I can't find where to change that. I need an accurate app that constantly updates, and this isn't it."

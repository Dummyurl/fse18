        "Definitely the best timetable application out there. This is a really good app, from what I've seen so far. The reason it gets 4 stars is because I think it should have a way of editing the room and teacher for a registered subject on a period-by-period basis. Right now I have to have a separate registered subject for each different room, or I have to have unregistered subjects. Neither option is particularly desirable. Other than that though this app is great and I still highly recommend it.",
        "Very handy with good UI on both Phone and Smartwatch. Would be very nice to have notifications at the start of each period and if the weeks changed automatically.  One issue I have at the moment is that I've set the timetable refresh time to '16:00 the day before', regardless, the timetable won't update until 00:00 on the day.",
        "Its great, does the basic things I expected it to do and has a nice theme/layout. Only thing I'd add is separate times for each day. Other than that, its pretty great for a free app!",
        "Really good for school timetable! The timetable feature is the best one ive found and supports moving devices. however it can be quite tedious to set up and i havnt found a good use for the assignments mainly because i am not allowed to use my phone when they are set.",
        "Like it. Best timetable application till date. Would be great if you could add notifications for lectures and assignments. Also the banner ads are kind of annoying, would have preferred the earlier full screen ad in between.",
        "Doesn't work if not all your periods are the same time every day Mine different between days of the week, so they stop lining up"

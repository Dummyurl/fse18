        "Nice and simple, a life changing tool I have several hobbies and projects which I would like to work on and use KeepDo for tracking 5 min of my time a day for each one (e.g. read a book, eat vitamins, work on a coding project, go to bed at a predefined time). So far it works great, I can see how little by little it helps me to achieve my goals. I even use it to track things I want to not do (distractions) and it works equally well. Kudos to the author(s)!",
        "Nice and free, small size. If you can add a counter for a task done daily like do drills 2x a day, ability to add notes for a day and also add a symbol for not done but this app is already excellent. Thanks."

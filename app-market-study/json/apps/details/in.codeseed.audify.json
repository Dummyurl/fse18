        "The app is great, developers did a good job. But I have one missing feature to mention: p.e. in whatsapp I receive messages in different languages (English, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch) , and all of them are spoken with the default language (English),and it is pretty annoying. This language resiliency feature is present in one app in the play store (@Voice Aloud Reader) which speaks in the language of the webpage or whatever other content in the appropriate language and it would be a great feature if your app has it too. Is it in your plans to implement that in the future?",
        "Audify is the best of this type of app available. I use it constantly, it works perfectly.  I recently had an issue with my Bluetooth hearing aids not turning on quickly enough to relay short notifications. Even though it wasn't an Audify problem, the developers took the time to analyse what was happening and provided a solution.  Outstanding support!",
        "Still a 5... Starting a new year right. I never give 5 stars, but you made it. The one app I am truly happy using, & with great support. Thank you.",
        "SCAMWARE...   AUTHOR IS WORRYINGLY SILENT IN RESPONSE TO HIS USERS LEGITIMATE OBSERVATIONS.  BAD DEVELOPER.  YOU GET 250 FREE ANNOUNCEMENTS THEN IT'LL STOP WORKING AND DEMAND MONEY TO CONTINUE!  BAD APPLICATION.  PATHETIC SCAM... DON'T DOWNLOAD... A COMPLETE WASTE OF EVERYBODY'S TIME.",
        "One of my favourite essential Android apps. Would love it if there was a way to read out notifications on Google Home devices.",
        "Would love if this app had Tasker/automate plug-in support to allow more control"

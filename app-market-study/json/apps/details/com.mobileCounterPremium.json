Sometimes it refuse to lissen my settings and do what it wants. And no matter how many times i change it. Developers are probably abandoned us. The information above requires to check after update. There is one more thing! :) Hey guys! Do you know which month has 36 days? The answer is... it could be any mouth you're counted by Mobile Counter 2! Good job!",

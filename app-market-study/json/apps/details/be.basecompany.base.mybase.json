        "Shows two different remaining credit amounts, while I know for a fact that I'm already over my limit. Garbage app, don't bother.",
        "I have been using this app since I bought Base SIM card. It doesn't update my data consumption, instead of that, I log out and re-log in to see my latest consumption state. Overall, I don't see my credit value in latest updates any more.",
        "Everytime I use it requies update an reconfiguration of the account. Completely useless. I stopped using it.",
        "registration doesn't work even after new install in android device",
        "Downloaded it despite the negative feedback should've listened",
        "Sinds een update kan ik het resterende belkrediet niet meer raadplegen. Als oplossing wordt voorgesteld dat je dat toch kan raadplegen via sms of door te bellen. Waardeloze app dus!   ---------- Antwoord op Abdel: Na telefonische bevestiging dat dit verwijderd was en zeker niet meer ging teruggezet worden, dan toch iemand die wél weet hoe het werkt! Bedankt Abdel!"

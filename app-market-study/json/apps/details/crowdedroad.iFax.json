        "They take your money and never help you",
        "Pretty awesome",
        "Sadly has to be a single star, as it didn't work.  It said fax was over 20mb limit but was around 8mb. Even subscribed to unlimited,  but it then after that told me I must buy credits.  No way would I spend more. Customer services did reply with decent timeframe and have been polite. App 1 star Customer services 3 stars.",
        "This app does not work as it states. I had to send a fax multiple time for the receiver to get it even though I the app said fax delivered. I also could not open faxes received with out extra charge. This was within the one week free trial too. Even when I agreed to the charge because I needed the fax, once I opened it the fax disappeared. I could never retrieve it. I emailed the developer multiple time the response was \"App ticket was closed and merged into this request\" or \"your request is registered as CC on this request.\" Finally, they sent an email stating they found no problems with the account and they sent a fax without a problem. I return the email restating I can't open the faxes received as I stated in previous emails. They had no suggestions. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY."

        "This is my second favorite Bible App, second only to the Logos Bible app. The Comments are powerful and helpful, I would miss having them if I were to use any Bible without them. I still use this app in addition to using Logos because of the comments and the simplicity of copying, highlighting and sharing verses and quotes.",
        "It's wonderful to have the SOP comments on verses.  This addition helps with understanding greatly.",
        "Awesome. Well done. Highlights bookmarks and notes with EGW comments",
        "Amazing..!!",
        "What a blessing to study your Bible and get more info on a specific verse that might be unclear. You read the Bible and then select the verse you want more information about, or a specific word in that verse. A word that is hard to understand like \"fear\" in Prov 1:7. It then gives you a direct link to another app by the same developer called Bible Tools with different commentaries and extracts from EGW books and manuscripts. It opens automatically and you can continue reading more about the verse you did not understand before. So now there is no more reason to \"fear\" the Lord or stay ignorant of Bible truth and depend on others to interpret scripture meaning for you. Don't forget to meditate on Prov 3:5 daily.",
        "It was KJV.  Now it does not seem so, neither can I find where it says so.  OI like yo know what I am readi ng."

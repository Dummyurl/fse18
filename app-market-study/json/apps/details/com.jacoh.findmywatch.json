        "Does nothing Installed and it does absolutely nothing.  Nothing at all.  There are three buttons and they are entirely unresponsive.  Correction, the donate button works.  The other two buttons do nothing.",
        "Simple and fast, limited only by your hearing Found my watch after 15 minutes, was hard to hear vibrations because of where it fell. Fast install, simple, and works like a charm!",
        "Wonderful App. This app saved me from looking in the dumbest places. I turn on the app and click the send message button and boom! My watch is simply under my pillow again. Thanks for the app, works amazing!",
        "Many Android Wear Watches have a speaker. Please make your app also play a noise on the watch speaker. This would make it much easier to find.",
        "Why does this app not work? Does nothing but install and show a very simple gui, find, stop and donate. Fix your app and include complimentary instructions and troubleshooting.",
        "Need to add sound.. Would be a whole lot better if it had a sound for those who have a speaker on their watch... the flashing colors don't help if my watch is under a shirt"

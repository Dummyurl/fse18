        "Every time they update this app they fix one problem and create two more.  Latest problem is that the miles per gallon rating in the trip log is useless. It goes from .1 mpg to 5000 plus mpg.   Never a credible number.  And these guys want to sell us a self-driving car someday?",
        "Don't like the new interface. Fuel gauge is really small. Interface is generally slow to respond. Always reports MPG as 0.1. Someone forgot to write their unit tests... Vehicle updates are slow and sometimes fail to update at all.",
        "User interface takes too long to enable buttons to remote start or lock doors. I should be able to open the app and issue the command immediately, and then let the app make the connection in the background so I'm not forced to wait. That's just poor UI design.",
        "At first the app didn't work. However, I went to the ford dealer and they updated my 2017 Ford fusion Energi. Now it works great!",
        "Won't update. Every time I open it tries to update and fails. All my car information is from last August. I use to like this app when it worked.",
        "Generally works well especially the charging mobile alerts and remote start.  One annoying issue is the Trip and charge log fuel economy MPG rating is always wrong.  On my 35 mile drive this morning it said my economy was 3104 MPG.  This was working a few months ago when originally installed.  Any fix for it?"

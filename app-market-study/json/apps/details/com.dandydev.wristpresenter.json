        "Does not work I don't enjoy writing one star reviews but unfortunately for this app I have to. Never does it ask to connect with Google Drive and no companion app is installed on the Lg of device(latest firmware). It would have been a great app if the developer would take these issues into consideration, and I will update my review I'd that ever happens.",
        "Doesn't work The app never ask to connect to Google Drive, so I can't see my slides. I really need to use this app, so I will wait you to fix this and I will change my review if it works.",

        "Does not work Very annoying app. Could not get to work at all on LG G3 plus LG G Watch R (latest firmware) using Google Drive and Google Slides. Totally useless and certainly not fit for purpose in a real world work situation. Deleted (accompanied by Nelson Munz punch to developer's rib cage).",

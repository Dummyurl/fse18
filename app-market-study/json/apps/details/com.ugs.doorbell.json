    "description": "Braci's Hearing Assistant beta gives you the ability to record your environmental and home sounds to alert you in case of events which are important for you like fire alarms, doorbells, and more. Unlike other solutions with flashing lights and expensive hardware installations, Braci allows you to use the current building infrastructure and alarm systems installed and still be alerted to events even if you are unable to hear or see them. This can give you a sense of security and peace of mind. Braci Hearing Assistant beta is efficient when it comes to quick response, alert time, and is also very affordable (this version is free). It's perfect for people who are hard-of-hearing, deaf, elderly, and for others too.The app uses your smartphone or smart device/watch's microphone to constantly listen to your environment when you activate \"Detection Mode\". Braci can be connected to smart watches such as the Pebble Watch or those on Android Wear. This easy-to-use app enables a fast way to be notified of all situations. The unique Braci platform is able to detect a broad range of sounds with it's smart algorithm and alerts the user by vibrating their smartphone and smartwatch, flashing your mobile’s camera light, and showing an icon image of the current event on your smartphone and smart watch’s screen with a text note of the name of the event under the icon.We hope you enjoy your experience using this great new technology and appreciate your feedback so we can constantly improve. Important Note: This application is a test version, which is currently under development.Below is the user manual for the Braci Hearing Assistant beta:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-8fyajy4aKAS3pRekpva2U3NWc/view?usp=sharingFor more information please visit us at : www.braci.co",

        "Vibration  not on I recorded te doorbell sound and tried to turn on vibration. But it didn't vibrate. Yes, I did go to advanced setting to turn it on. Nothing. Help me.",
        "Good app but... I don't always feel it vibrate.  Making the led flash when the doorbell goes would be a godsend.",
        "A little sad no Android wear support just pebble watch",
        "Cool idea, needs more granulairity This looks great for my hearing-impaired relatives, but they have multiple doorbells with different sounds (one for front, one for back).  The app only supports one doorbell sound, so they can only be notified for one door.",

New Geofence feature for automatic Away/Home modes!Support for Android Wear added!Widget now available for quick view of thermostats (*Paid users only).Opt out of Energy Events!Support for forcing thermostat to follow your schedules if EcoFactor has changed them (*Paid users only).Usage and Savings reports are available for you to review.FAQ section now available.This application allows you to view and change your EcoFactor/ mPowered/ NV Energy thermostat settings, set away/back modes, change HVAC/Fan modes, manage schedules, manage templates, change thermostat names, view last read time, and edit away times for EcoFactor / mPowered / NV Energy enabled thermostats. You can view all of your EcoFactor / mPowered/ NV Energy  controlled thermostats by location, current temperature information, outside temperature, average indoor temperature, and average neighbor temperature (to see how your settings compare). Moving between thermostats is as easy as swiping left or right or clicking the tabs. You can change individual thermostat settings, set specific away settings, and disable away mode. Turning off your HVAC or Fan for individual thermostats is also supported.Please do read the notes though to understand limitations of this application. Send any issues or questions to support@supremevue.com.Join our EcoFactor Wrap Google+ community at https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/103094460973860670288.Features:★ View and choose from multiple locations.★ View and change temperatures for all thermostats.★ Temperatures displayed to two decimal places.★ Quickly change HVAC and Fan modes.★ Set Away/Back mode.★ Edit away times when in Away mode.★ Manage thermostat schedules★ Manage schedule templates★ Change thermostat name★ View average indoor, neighbor, and outdoor temperatures.★ View usage and savings reports.★ Override any changes EcoFactor might make to your thermostat settings.★ Opt out of Energy Events★ Configurable Widget for quick view of thermostats★ Android wear notifications and widget-like view of thermostatsPlease note the following:1) Any updates to the EcoFactor web site will most probably break this application as it relies on the current web site to perform it's magic.2) There is limited error checking currently as there is no documentation on what to expect as a response from the web site. Please be understanding when those situations occur and provide feedback to us at support@supremevue.com so that we can investigate the issue and potentially provide a fix.3) Current temperature is displayed to two decimal places so that you can understand why your heating/cooling is running even when it appears to be at temperature. This comes directly from the thermostat and is not an estimate.IMPORTANT: This is NOT an official EcoFactor or NVEnergy mPowered application (nor are we affiliated in any way with EcoFactor or NV Energy) and only reads information available from the EcoFactor web site and does not connect to your thermostats directly. If your thermostats show as disconnected or you suspect other issues, login to the actual EcoFactor web site to verify the application shows the same information or contact your energy company for assistance.",

        "10/17 Still wonderful ty. If u have this app,  u most likely have the box thru the energy Co,  THEY have the ability to change the temp based on saving energy.  So again,  ITS NOT THE APP!!!   Do ur homework people..      9/16 TIP, take app off auto update,ONLY update app whn u learn it's stable & working prop.Ignore otherwise.      4/2/16/I STLL love, enjoy & use this app EVRY SNGLE DAY! It's not 'Flwless' but the smll, kinks get workd out qckly. It wrks 99% of the time, thts good for me.        (1st REVIEW 2014) Omg I love this app! Tysm Devs. I use this daily, and also have schedules set for auto on-off days. I have so many house guests ask me abt this app. So far Zero issues tysm.",
        "I like that I can control my system from anywhere, however I can't use the template manager nor can I set my system to respond to weekend/weekday temp. variations. It only allows me to update for one temp at the same time daily. I have considered paid app, but am worried if the product won't work how it should in the first place.",
        "The unavailability for several days every time the app updates is getting old.",
        "It's Great,  I have control from anywhere",
        "You put your temp on 73and it winds up at 77 77smh",
        "Pleasure to use."

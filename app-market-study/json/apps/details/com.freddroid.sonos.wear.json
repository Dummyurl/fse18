        "It works....... Changing my review of this.  Now been using it for a while and whilst limited in function it does work. I can control all 5 connect amps from my watch. Allows control over basic functions but better than nothing. Sometimes won't connect. Using Samsung S7 Edge and Sony SW3",
        "My Sony Smart Watch will not connect to my Sonos Play 3 so this app is pretty useless.",
        "Does not work, does not connect with sonos",
        "Does the job. Stopped connecting to my phone :(",
        "Doesn't connect. Refund please Doesn't work. Keeps saying 'waiting to  connect'.",
        "Basic control of Sonos through smartwatch Does exactly what it says. Easy to use. Well done.  Hopefully this app will be further developed."

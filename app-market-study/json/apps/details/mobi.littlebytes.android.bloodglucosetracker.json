        "The only complaint is that I can't track my medications taken like I can my blood. That would be great to make sure that I didn't miss my pills. Keep up the great work. . Aug 6 I am now using this to track my foods and blood pressure as well.  . I can't even describe how much this is going to help me when it comes to tracking and reporting to my doctor. . I give it 6 out of 5 stars!",
        "This is a very good little app with some serious disadvantages. It is very easy to use, but the export of data only works for the sugar level. So, while you can enter and check blood pressure for example, you cannot print it it and show it to your doctor. Also there is no export to CSV file or something like that. With a little more effort this could become a truly great app.",
        "Been using for a couple of weeks and fairly impressed. Let's me add sugar levels when needed but I do sometimes have to go back and edit auto cooments like \"after lunch\" as it must assume I eat at same time every day. Will keep using though as it seems a useful and easy to use app. Edit:when rating app, was asked if it had a \"leader board\"? Wouldn't that be fun? I'll raise you my best 18.8mmol/l üòÅ",
        "As a newly diagnosed diabetic I really needed some place to write things down in a way that made sense this app covers everything. You input your sugar levels there is a place for you to put your food intake there is a tab for medication and even a tab for your blood pressure. This app works really well for me.",
        "Very simple to use and see trends for blood sugar. The only thing I don't like if you have to enter exactly how much food you ate.  There isn't just a journal aspect to food recording. Also I would love for this to sync with my fitness app!",
        "Had this app on my old phone. Had trouble syncing/transferring my old data across. Paying for monthly subscription. Reached out to support. No response after 1 month despite 2 tickets and numerous emails being sent. Great app, disappointing service. If they bother to contact me ill update my rating."

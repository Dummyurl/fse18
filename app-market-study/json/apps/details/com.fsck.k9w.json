        "Forwarding of attachments Hi. Since upgrading to the latest version of wristmail for wear, where the name changed, I have not been able to forward attachments on my Sony Xperia Z1 compact even after the attachment has been downloaded. When I tap forward, the attachment is not included and has to be manually attached. Can anyone help me here. Thanks.",

        "Awesome, but why no layout in watch? It is fantastic! Good work. However, why it is plain text with no layout in watch? No paragraph at all. I couldn't read my mail like that.",
        "Great email app Love it.  Based on K9 mail I think, but with wear support.  I also prefer it over stock Android email and I use it on non wear devices too.",
        "Good email for wear Good email for wear but I wish I could compose new emails and have the option to forward emails too from the watch.",
        "Great app but needs update to reflect k9mail merge to lastest version."

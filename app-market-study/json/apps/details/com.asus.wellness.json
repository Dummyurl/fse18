        "I was unhappy for the android wear updare 1.5 to 2.0 on my new asus zenwatch 3 after i bought it for 5day. Now after the update some of the features like ZenWatch manager, zenwatch remote & facedesign cannot be install to the watch. Cannot copy google account to watch, therefore play store on watch doesn't work. Eventhought google play music doesn't exit anymore on the watch. New gorgeous watch because an update felt like less features..... Pls fix this matter asap.  If not the watch not worthy for me any more. Fed up with this problem.",
        "Delete this app from zenwatch3 can boost performance. my zenwatch 3 is actually slow with frame dropping but I don't have a good way to remove the app from my watch. Hope you guys could realize the problem.",
        "It fails to properly track sleep with interruptions. I wake up for 10 minutes and my sleep is only counted from when I go back to bed. This is a major issue and support failed to respond to my request for help.",
        "App takes way to long to show activity logs. I'm not talking seconds either more like minutes. The graphs are basic in my opinion too and could be more detailed or have more views/filters. The watch app is fine, it's the phone app that needs work.",
        "I always use this ,everyday it will run by itself,but I noticed that wrong when I was on the bus .The steps count  detection had going on .so I need you to fix it as soon as you can.",
        "Data not transferable to other apps to keep a running record of my calories burned.  I mean I have to write the numbers down and then type them into another app.  Want to look at my data over more than just one week."

        "Gps is fairly good. Functionality is a little tricky at times. It's fine if you are recording your exercise as you go but its a bit confusing if you want to add past exercise logs. My biggest irritation is that I wish it gave the option to change the start of the week to Monday instead of Sunday. I'd also like to see the ability to change the 'other 1,2,3,etc' options to specify what you are doing instead of writing in the description",

        "Great Game On Moto 360 Again, to everyone who keeps saying you can't find it on your phone - this is NOT a phone app. It's for Android Wear. For those with Moto 360 - it takes a few minutes to populate. As for the game itself - great game! As with other games on smart watches, takes a bit to get used to the controls, but once you do it's a great puzzler to kill time with!",
        "Wear games owned You guys have taken over the wear apps. Brilliant graphics, easy controls and original games just wow keep it up",
        "Nice game Seems to stutter slightly every now and then on the LG G Watch though.",
        "Worked great Nice fluidity, easy to use controls, and nothing gets cut of on my circular display moto 360",
        "Expectation is higher Gud game hard to imagine i am playing it on my watch. I got a lg G watch it works perfectly without lag. Thanks for the game but make more interesting games and i will give it a five star.",
        "HELP exactly when does the app sync into the watch? Its been an hour now and nothing happened... I use a Sony smartwatch 3 (updated to 6.0.1) please help"

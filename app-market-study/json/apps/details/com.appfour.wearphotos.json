        "So if I want to see all of my photos on the watch I have to pay :)  Not only the loading times of the pictures are ridiculously slow, the quality is mediocre at best, the horrible ads, but then when you need the application to do its job it tells you you have to pay if you want to see ALL of the pictures. Then why on earth don't you make it a paid application in the first place, without the ads and get it over with??? Absolutely horrible way of selling your product. Immediate uninstall."

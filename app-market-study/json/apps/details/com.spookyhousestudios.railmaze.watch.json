        "Great game but please make it work on round screens! The controls get cut off so it's almost unplayable. With this fix it would certainly be a five star app",
        "Cool concept It's a cool concept, but it doesn't work on the LG Urbane. Other spooky house games work on round screens, so this is kind of a let down.",
        "Addicting It worked well with the Asus Zen Watch 2. Done levels were pretty easy others took much longer to figure out. Overall a nice game to kill some time",
        "Doesn't work on round screens Cuts off outer edges to where it's not playable such a good game for a watch but u can't even play it cuase cuts off outer edges on moto 360 such a dissapointment",
        "Incompatible with round screen! The game takes the touch screen to the outer round edge where it is not playable!",
        "Almost 2018 - Still unplayable with round screens (Needed play controls are out of view on round screens). Considering no new updates since 2014, I can see why. Disappointing."

        "Twist-to-count does not work properly Was a nice app but recently twist-to-count feature works inaccurate on LG G Watch R with 5.1.1. Some twists are ignored even if you wait some time between attempts.",
        "Works great! Now has Moto 360 support. \"OK Google, start counter\" opens app. When your watch needs to wake up, continue counting by sliding the notification card up into view.",
        "Easy Remembers your count until you reset it, additional options allows for substraction if mistaken, or add from the notification card. Great for beer counting in the pub.",
        "Excellent app! I use it daily. Can you make it available in black so that it will conserve battery?",
        "Works very well as a row counter for knitting. I especially like the notification cards so the watch screen can be in ambient mode most of the time. Twist to count looks interesting, but not for knitting!",
        "Cool app just missing custom colour I can see me using this in supermarket etc. It would be great to be able to configure the colour."

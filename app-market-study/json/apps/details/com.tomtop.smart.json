        "Enjoying my scales. App seems limited in what it can do - won't connect with Samsung Health for example but the info it produces is useful and interesting",
        "I spent 1 hour trying to connect a blood pressure monitor. It seems imposible. What a waste of time and money!",
        "I'm actually delighted with my purchase of the arm BP monitor, I assume earlier issues with setting up have been dealt with because it was incredibly simple to do and took a couple of minutes.  My reasons for four stars not five are both app related, it is easy to use but finding out how to export to email for instance is not intuitive, and I'm fairly tech savvy. But good old Google soon provided the solution and once exported it's easy to copy and paste the numbers into a spreadsheet, work out overall averages etc for my GP.   My other small gripe is that I can't add a short note to readings - for example today my BP has changed and it would have been useful to have that recorded in the reading.  Otherwise really pleased and would definitely recommend, I'm now saving up for the scales :)",
        "Bought the bloodpressuremeter because it should connect over wifi (instead of just bluetooth). But this is not working at all, not even with the app opened as mentioned on their website. Too bad.",
        "Just doesn't seem to work. Won't pair with BP monitor. Error messages are nonsensical. Asks for permissions that are completely out of line. Device behavior is erratic. Support website has dead links to support docs. This is one of the worst apps I've ever tried to use.",
        "Utterly horrific setup experience. Installed and created an account expressly to use a new connected blood pressure cuff. The app is filled with typographical errors. The types of permissions necessary to enable the app are intrusive and nonsensical. The device setup workflow doesn't remotely match the written instructions. I still haven't figured it out and I've been designing software interfaces for two decades. It just looks like another app that scrapes personal data, for aggregation and resale, returns no value to me and drains my battery."

        "Was a really good app... This app and others just stopped working when Android wear was updated shame. Task manager is the way to go now for me they sussed it! Update :Thanks for the reply, reinstalled and working perfectly and very happy ðŸ˜Š",
        "Works well As long as the developer keeps it updated, it can be a real help when your watch starts bogging down. If there was a task manager that could kill individual apps, I would six star this.",
        "Great Sped up my moto 360 2nd gen really well, hoping that they could add a auto ram clean up so that the device stays smooth all the time, by releasing ram when watch has stopped being used for a length of time that would be great!",
        "Hooray! Works beautifully on 5.1.1 now. I knew you could do it! Way to go Dev.!",
        "Nice App Easy to use. Helps alot! Thank you",
        "Great app This app should have came standard on Android Wear. This is the next best thing to a full on Task Manager (who knows maybe the next update?). Definitely worth the dollar great job on this all and the other 2!"

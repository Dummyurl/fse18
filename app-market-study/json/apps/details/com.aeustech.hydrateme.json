        "Great app that is easy to use Everyone needs to drink more water this is a quick reminder to help you reach your goal. Easy to record your water with just a tap. I like the 5 minute snooze if I'm not able to drink water I can snooze it and attempt to get it done within 5 minutes and no fear of forgetting. Very easy to adjust to fit you. Using on a Moto 360 v2.",
        "Helpful, but I would like it to remember that I want to drink a specified number of glasses every day - I drink 11 8 oz and I have to set it every day. If I am target I still get the alarms which is annoying. I would like to set when I should drink and if I input that I drank water then I should not get the alarm. Keep updating please it is a beautiful and clean design.",
        "Cool app Simple and easy to use.",
        "I bought the app but i didn't get it on samsung gear s3 neither my telephone , where it is",
        "Add an option to disable it on weekends.",
        "Does Exactly what it says...I LOVE this app!"

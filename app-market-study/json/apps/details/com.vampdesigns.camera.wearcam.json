        "\"Wear\" is a reference to ANDROID WEAR devices. Samsung Gear watches use Tizen, and its apps are downloaded via the Samsung Apps store, or via the SamsungGear app for Android, NOT VIA GOOGLE PLAY STORE. As similar apps are also available there, those of you rating the ANDROID WEAR app badly because you're clueless should go try the software MADE FOR YOUR SAMSUNG DEVICE, and change your unfair rating of this one correspondingly. Your idiocy is mind-blowing. This s*** drives me nuts...",
        "Need some bugfixes as Video capturing works but photo doesn't, and phone app used to launch on launching wear app but that to stopped after recent update.",
        "It really works!! I'm really pleased.",
        "Good",
        "Unable to use on my Gear s3 Classic. It does just fine as a camera on my phone, but I already have that. My watch isn't able to take the photos nor the videos. I've gone through the app settings all over and can't seem to understand how to configure the app to my watch.. kinda disappointing. Please help, I was looking forward to using this.",
        "I can't download it to my watch? Not in wear store just goes to phone?"

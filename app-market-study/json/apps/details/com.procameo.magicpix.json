Loved the Chromecast feature from the photo gallery and pictures organization. Lots of great features - voice control, HDR mode, histogram, exposure control, color effects, burst mode, and smart watch control for Android wear!",
        "Killer camera app with chromecast - love the smartwatch photo preview and nice professional icon layout Love the chromecasting feature. Quite innovative app.  Like the voice control update and the remote control feature with Android smartwatch.  RGB histogram, photo effects, continuous photos, HDR, exposure control and pinch zoom!  It got it all!",
        "Please fix the gallery Its really buggy! Please just use the normal phone gallery and make a seperate gallery app for editing. Rest of app is perfect.",

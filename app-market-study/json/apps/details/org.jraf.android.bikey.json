        "Yeah, It's Good Agree with other reviewer...does everything I want it to; top, average speed, elapsed time, records tracks on map, backs up to GDrive without ads or pestering you with new friend requests or a huge t.o.s. to agree to. App takes about five seconds to get hang of and contrary to other reviews I've read, there IS a stop button. Just hit the \"start\" button again which pauses everything, then hit the \"back\" button. Voila! Great job, great app!",
        "Amazing!  One of those rare gems that 1) works as advertised, 2) is simple and intuitive, and, 3) doesn't ask for unecessary and intrusive Permissions.  Instantly maps recorded rides on Google Maps and doesn't require a data connection during the ride.  Automatically pauses Moving Duration when you stop riding while Total Duration continues.  Just an intelligently designed app, well-implemented.  Great!",
        "I like the simplicity of this app.  I don't have a data plan on my phone and it still works great.  Then when I get to wi-fi the plot of my route shows up on the screen.  I appreciate that there is no login associated with it and that I don't have to store anything on-line.  I can only think of one more feature that might make it even better for ppl like me without data plans...  If the app could take advantage of the downloaded Google Map data that I already have in my phone, it would allow me to see where I am and have been in real time without having to switch to Google Maps.  I know that that isn't simple, but then it would be essentially equivalent to the bike specific GPS units.  Great app.  Took me a while to find it, but very pleased with it.  Thanks!",
        "Works great and has become my favorite bike app. Love the large contrasting display and it doesn't rapidly drain my battery. Would be nice though if Bikey also tracked the current weather conditions when logging a ride.",
        "Positives: * Simple, intuitive and easy to use * Interface is functional and uncluttered * Synced easily to HR monitor.   Negatives: * Understated speed, distance and HR compared to other apps - at least for off-road * Export files don't preserve HR data.   Overall for me it is an uninstall, I wanted to like it but couldn't live with it as my primary cycling app.",
        "App with no brakes Great app  . I like to give 5 stars but lack of stop and save buttons took one star out. I can start quick I can pause but no stop . It has auto save but likes a saving option."

    "description": "You are a penguin! Who sadly cannot swim. As you hop from ice cube to ice cube dodging deadly turtles and icicles, you have one goal in mind: survive for as long as you can. This is no easy task... in fact, 30 seconds of life is an accomplishment!  Part puzzle, part maddening frustration, this game will truly test your ability to simply live. Good luck... you will need it!  Play instructions: just tap to jump. The longer the tap, the higher the jump!   ★ Other FAQ Details ★   - This application supports both round and square watch screen types.   - There are no impossible situations presented (that I am currently aware of). The \"puzzle\" part is that while sections are randomly selected from a large pool, they are pre-designed and all have a solution.    - Known bugs to be fixed shortly: To leave the application, one occasionally has to swipe it closed twice.★ Final Thoughts ★   Thank you for trying my application! If you like it, leave a review and tell your friends. :) Please email me if you notice any issues or believe something could be improved to make the experience better. Take care and have a good day!",

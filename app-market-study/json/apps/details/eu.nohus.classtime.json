        "As a teacher this is invaluable. I always know exactly how long I have till class ends. It is perfect for making sure I get exit slips out in time and get cleanup taken care of. The developer responds quickly (Thank you) and I was able to find my notifications had been blocked on my watch somehow. If the watch could vibrate with the alerts like the phone at the time left that would be fantastic. Or if you could make a new schedule based off your old one easier for those odd days. Would make the app fantastic.  This app is a must have for Teachers, and I have recommended it to several already. Thanks again!",
        "I wish it had a complication for wear 2.0 so i could always see how much time is left without needing a constant notification taking up my whole watch",
        "Useless without some modifications.  It will not allow the naming of  schedules.  It will not allow more than 5 periods.  For my use as a teacher, and for the High School schedules where I work, it is useless, despite its many options.",
        "Perfect app.. but problems with notification in miui... is that possible to add transparent backgroung for notification?? (i have bought notification color and widget) and can you add a widget color setting??",
        "It is very useful in keeping an eye on my class schedule, with a good amount of detail. The app creators are also very helpful, responding almost immediately if any issues are encountered.",
        "Thank you very much for solving my issues. I am therefore increasing the rating from 2 to 5. Good job developers"

        "Are 2 main things that are really a must be in this app: allow to send from Google Maps a location directly to the Car. The travel log should show and calculate the real travel not point to point straight since the distance is wrong. Please make this happens.",
        "I receive data, see  where the car is temprature etc. But cannot send information to the car, start heater  honk n flash etc. It makes the app rather useless",
        "The app seems not to get a respond signal from the car when a command has been executed. E.g. The app get stuck on \"starting heater\". One has to kill the app and restart to see that the heater is on.",
        "Works great albeit a bit slow when sending commands. Would get 5 stars if there was support for Google Assistant üòÅ",
        "Freezes, wrong status, fix it please.",

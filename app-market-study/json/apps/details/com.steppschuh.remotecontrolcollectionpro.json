        "Works well, a little input lag but to be expected when using a remote. Nice that it works with smartwatch(moto 360 2(2015)) but please add a little more functionality too the smart watch side though(mouse/keyboard/custom buttons) really fun being able to control presentation/media from watch, will definitely use next time I'm presenting something",
        "You wont actually regret paying about $4 on this thing. I know that I could have the apk for free on xda or somewhere. But come on, whats the joy in that. You gotta give credit to the dev as well. Performance wise, does everything as told and expected. It could have been awesome if it could utilize higher network speed to remove the glitches and make the display view more fluid, robust and efficient. Thanks for the awesome utility program.",
        "Would be the best app ever if : 1.you could send more commands p/sec (getting rid of the lag) 2. It had a custom shortcut/command option, making it able to launch apps (firefox,media player,games, etc),with some respective subcommands ( shortcuts to facebook,youtube,etc / diffrent files in difrent drives,etc) 3. Devote time to every comand, like, trying to use youtube has been the single worst experience I have had so far, if you would again use some shortcuts like play,pause, etc and do this for every application this app would actually",
        "Good app, does what's advertised. Happy with the app, but the remote desktop could use a full screen button for lazy people who don't want to turn on their screen rotation. Do that and you get 5 stars",
        "Best remote app Overall it's a great app and so far the best. User interface is beautiful. I would have given it a 5 if media mode worked with players other than Windows media player e.g VLC , and if I could turn the volume up/down by pressing the volume keys while the phone is locked.",
        "General Overall I love this app. Sometimes I find it lagging, can be difficult to truly control what's happening on the pc. I think aside from access to tool bar moving around the pc screen should behave like touch screen, scroll bars not needed."

        "Sort of works? The food and ball blink next to him but he isn't shown eating it. And it's weird to feed him steak. But the bubbles appear directly over him. I can't tell if there was any effect because I can't open the \"humger\" (yes with an m) or happy green buttons. So, don't bother.",
        "It doesn't open on watch Instead, it opens on the phone as a phone game but just stretched out. I like it but looks awful on the phone.",
        "Not actually an android wear app would be great if this were an android wear app as it is advertised, but it isn't.",
        "Doesn't fit on a circular watch face but quite a good game",
        "Did not work in moto 360 Did not work on my watch. I uninstalled it.",
        "App will nog start on moto 360. The companion app for the mobile phone is the same APK as the one for the watch"

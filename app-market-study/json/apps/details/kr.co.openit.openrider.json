        "Too lame asking to give up your contacts. How is it even legal handing over contact information to strangers with out consent. GPS seems non functional. Imidiate uninstall.",
        "Excited to find a nice bike computer, the GPS seems to be tracking my location fine, but speedometer is not indicating a speed. It just stays at zero.",
        "I've been cycling for the past 1 month , I used many apps namely Strava, Runtastic, Map my ride, Google Fit, but honestly i must admit that this is by far the best app i Used. The app continuously monitors and displays the speed and distance, which is not available on other apps.",

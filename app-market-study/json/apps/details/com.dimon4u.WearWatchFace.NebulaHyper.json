        "Beautiful Installed on my Huawei and no sign of the time lapse mentioned in some of the older reviews. I have several watch apps and this is my new favourite. Not sure how it will impact on battery life, but shouldn't be a problem for the Huawei.",
        "Stunning face, could do with options. Great looking face, would be nice to have different time options such as analogue and placement.",
        "Woot Worth every penny. Love live watch faces. Great job.",
        "Awesome watchface Watch face makes the moto 360 look amazing. Battery life is about the same as an animated facer watch face.  So I have about 20% left after 12 hours of use.  It lags a little on occasion, but that's Motorola's fault for including such a weak processor in the watch. Overall this is awesome.",
        "Laaaaag! Please fix the lag.  The design and look is awesome but it is compromised by the stuttering  lag.. Makes me regret buying it...",
        "Loved it but I had it on my Asus zen watch and within 2 minutes my battery was down to 14 percent. Had to uninstall."

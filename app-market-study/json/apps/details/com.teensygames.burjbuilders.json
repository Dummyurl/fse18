The goal is to build the highest and most stable Burj possible. You need to touch clouds, birds and sky by increasing height of your Burj.Big blocks move from one side to other and you have to decide when to place them on the best spot with a tap on you watch. If it fails to land perfectly on the block beneath, you will drop a slice of the block â€“ so the next block will not be as big as previous one. You will get a tiny tile to land the block making it difficult to construct a high tower. You have to best balance the tiles to set new record among your friends.

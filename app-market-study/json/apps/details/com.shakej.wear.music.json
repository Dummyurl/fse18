        "Doesn't work for music reliably. You have to tap 10 times the button and maybe it'll recognize one if those 10 times. Most probably it won't",
        "Used to be a good app for the Moto 360 The new update has the top and bottom buttons half off the screen due to the shape of the moto 360. Pressing play opens the music player but doesn't actually play the music. There's no chance people will pay £2.50 for a theme for this app.",
        "Almost didn't install Based on the rating I almost didn't even install it... Seriously people? It works well for me, I'm on Lollipop 5.1.1 its also free what is wrong with you people?? Should lower the donation 5$ is a bit much, I'd donate $1 if I could.",
        "It does what it's supposed to. Only drawback is, you have to open the music on your phone first.  Edit...  As I write this, I noticed that pressing play button on watch while music plays, causes the song to start over again rather than pick up from where it was stopped.",
        "Works Fine Open the app on your watch. Just try it. It works. Faster than Wear Music Controller, though not sure if the WiFi button works, however this is an added feature anyway, the main functionality is fine.",
        "A start. Worked for awhile then stopped. Had to reinstall over and over. A start.."

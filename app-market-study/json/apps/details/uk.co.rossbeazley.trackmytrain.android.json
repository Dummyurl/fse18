        "I tested this today and it does work. My late train was updated as the platform information changed. I am surprised there is no free app with more features like checking station times on the watch instead of keep having to go to the phone. I feel android Wear is still in infancy.",
        "Your better off guessing. Poor.",
        "Doesn't workðŸ˜•",
        "Fantastic app! Incredibly useful app. Has a great design with a nice Material Design UI. Excellent Android Wear app.",
        "Good app Handy app less faff than the national rail one",
        "Very nice app with a great UI. The tracking feature is quite handy to keep track of specific trains    However it would be nice if the functionality was expanded a touch, for instance the ability to favourite journeys (ie to and from work) would be quite useful to quickly check when the trains are and if their on time. Along the same lines a widget to quickly those journeys without having to open the app would be rather nice."

        "Not bad! Icon could be a bit bigger. Maybe use the profile picture as a background (á la hangouts messaging). I like it but the ui could use some work. Transitions are really nice though.",
        "Annoying daily notification \"Crispy tweets had arrived!..\" Please stop.",
        "Nice app Unfortunately the retweet button won't work. You should change the font to something taller like the system font.  Otherwise very beautiful wear app.",
        "Won't even open. Want my money back. Get Network Error every time. Uninstalled and reinstalled etc",
        "*where is the new notification feature?*   Great just needs a card or notification for new tweets instead of having to start the app each time on the watch to see the timeline",

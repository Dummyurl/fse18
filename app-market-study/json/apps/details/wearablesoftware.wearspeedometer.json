        "I used this Speedometer app frequently to check my Motorcycle Speedometer accuracy, especially when changing tires.  Initially it worked perfectly, then after update to Android 7.0, simply stopped working... always reads zero and records no movement.  The Android 7.0 totally Android-Wear for several apps.    Tried Factory Reset, Re-Sync Apps, all things on Web Forums.   No Go.    Good app when it works, try it and if it works, enjoy it!",
        "Doesn't really work. Tested a few times with Huawei Watch, location services on, but it kept showing 0. 100% of the time (the speed was about 30 km/h). It did show the average speed later, but I even don't know if I can really on its number. The design in nice. Deleting.",
        "The app used to work really well. Unfortunately, after upgrading to Android Wear 2.0, or soon after, it's simply stopped working. The speed always shows as zero now. Yes, I have a GPS signal and I can use other means such as GPS Test on the phone itself to get an accurate speed. Speed on my wrist Still Remains at zero all the time. A penny really, has when it worked, it works very very well.",
        "Good, Accurate Little App I ran my good old standby speedometer app on my phone and this one on my watch and drove around. Near perfect agreement. Now that it's been tested, this will be my tool for my old motorcycle with the busted speedometer.",
        "Speed 0? Doesn't show speed even though moving at 100+ km/hr. Samsung galaxy s5, marshmallow, lg urbane",
        "Lag and no reset function. Just go and download another free speedometer app :/"

        "Last update seems to have done something to this app, now entering a place to All Shops does not show up in Shopping List. Help is too confusing. Have been using this app for years and never had problems till now. Tried for an hour just to enter a shop to no avail, used to be real easy. Cleared cache, also to no avail. App has other issues with Categories and other sections,too. App is now useless to me. LG G2, Android 5.0.2 vers.",
        "Did I read correctly, on the IAP section of the app page, that this apps Pro version costs $329.99?  Update: After using this app for about 10 minutes, I finally realized that it's not for me.  I'll stick with OneNote.",
        "I wish you could choose where the ad's show up - top OR BOTTOM of screen, so you don't click on the wrong list when the ad pops in.   Also it would be great if you could add one more level of sub-categories to lists.   Thank you for considering to my feedback!",
        "A little complex to set up but excellent after that. Find a friendlier way to set up and you easily would deserve 5 stars",
        "Great app but when i activated categories i can't manually sort items, only categories. Why is that?",
        "Great app.  I use it for all my shopping lists."

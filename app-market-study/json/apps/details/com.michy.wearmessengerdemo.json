        "i can only give it an okay, the thing here is right off, this keyboard is horrible! this messenger works, and that's a great thing, but seriously this keyboard?  just isn't doable.",
        "Love it Can't fault it.  Texts great,  just this minute found the keyboard capability and quick replies so trying  that now. If that works OK I'll no doubt buy full version to see what extras I get :)",
        "Poop This demo version is so incredibly limited you can't even use it. The only contacts I can send a message to are the first five in your phone book, which for me is my Verizon contact, ex. #bal #pay, etc. Why would I pay for something when I can't even demo it?",
        "Help Cannot get it to sync to my LG Urbane 2, it is the only Android Wear app I can't get to the watch",
        "Useless on LG Urbane 2 as it won't send from the watch's own cell number.",
        "AW 2.0 isout but this SMS still uses its own shortcuts and text input..not what I was looking. Also no inbox."

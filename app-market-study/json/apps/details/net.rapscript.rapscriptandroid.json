        "Could be way better... I know the website which is pretty good, but the app always says that I don't have an working Internet connection even if I do... please fix :)    Update: Got fixed, I can use it now. But I thought the app gives a beat as well, not only words, just like the internet site. Also, I don't know why I need Internet to use this app then, because actually it only gives words, where is the need of Internet?",
        "Fix Problem Ok so the app is good,  but now it wont connect to the internet when i clearly have a full wifi signal... Come on i will bump it to 5 stars when fixed",
        "Definitely a great idea for an app. Creates a good way to exercise the mind and execution. Although, it would be so much more better if not for the \"network disruption\" or if it just didn't have to run on network service at all.",
        "Its ok but some words don't rhyme and I mostly like doing things that rhyme",
        "The website works better than the app. Says my network is down but yet I'm able to write this comment so I have a connection. PleAse fix.",
        "Fix it I would like it if it worked. It says it's not connecting to the Internet"

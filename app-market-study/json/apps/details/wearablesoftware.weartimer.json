        "Needs more work I like it - needs improved user interface for use on watch.  I use it while working out, which means quick glances at the screen to see time remaining.  Unfortunately, the small font is difficult to make out in this fashion.  Also, the timer end vibration needs to be longer, so not confused with other notifications.  Thanks, Sam",
        "Would be great but... Useless when it doesn't buzz with the screen dimmed. 4 star if that was fixed.   **was replied to by wearable software that the problem was fixed and to re-install and review again. The alarm will indeed buzz now when the watch screen is dimmed, the notification is delayed anywhere from 3-4 seconds late to 45 seconds late. Bumped up my review a little as now it has some use for me, would be nice if it was a consistent on time buzz when the timer was up.",
        "At first use I thought this was great.  It did everything I wanted.  However,  it didn't buzz when the screen was off  so in effect was useless.  Please fix this and I would give five stars. .  However,  no use as it stands.",
        "It's not fully functional When the screen is of the watch doesn't vibrate when timer reaches zero",
        "Not bad,... but it needs to vibrate a bit longer (one short buzz at the moment). A dismiss action would be nice.",
        "Does not notify Does not always notify when time is up.  Lg g watch r.  Would be great if worked properly.  Nice and simple and does job.  Shows time past set time which is great.  Just fix notification and will give 5 stars."

        "Yeck OMG! If I open my Gmail my WhatsApp and my messages to respond on my zenwatch this keyboard is nowhere to be found. I have installed and uninstalled and still nothing and, on top of that you can't get your money back.. No 15 minute refund from Google. How can something so simple to install and setup not work as it's supposed to. All I want to do is reply with this keyboard and I can't.",
        "Very hesitant 4 ðŸŒŸ 's , I couldn't get it to work at all on my G4, and now only works on my V20 with hangouts. I didn't find their support to be anything great when I contacted them either, though I did get a response to my email to their credit. This isn't a negative review, I like the app. I've had it for over half a year and it's just now working, but at least it's working. LG watch urbane 2nd edition",
        "Doesn't seem to work properly I have moto360 gen 2 and the app is enabled as per the instructions. The problem is the notifications are not being displayed in my watch even when there are messages being received in my phone. Sometimes it works fine and most of the time the notifications appear and disappear in a few seconds before i can view it. And sometimes I don't the get the notifications at all! Please fix the issue. Thanks.",
        "Good App works well with huawei watch, would give it 5 stars if we could start a new chat like whatsapp without reply on current chat. Like start a new chat....",
        "This app us a joke I payed good money for this app and it does nothing except take up space on my phone",
        "How i can refund my money?  This app is not working to me..  I see your guide in your website and do all of steps. But for me app is disabled and not change this status and not work..  Can you refund my money?"

        "The app is pretty good since it includes all the news sources you could want and is constantly adding more.   Given the amount of sources it does mean that at times images and videos won't load probably because of compatibility issues. But there's a nice workaround to that by using the \"Read this article on the web\" button at the end of an article.   Comments don't work at all, but I don't mind since I wouldn't use them anyway.   Speaking of which, a nice addition would be to disable reactions to articles.   They don't really offer much since there could be many reasons for one and no way to know what everyone means by them. They can easily be used to troll so it would be nice have the option to avoid them.   Great app nonetheless and hope the feedback is taken into consideration for further improvements.",
        "Hey enjoy this app for the most part but I just noticed something that needs to be changed quickly. When browsing with a Bluetooth mouse, wherever the pointer hovers there is a pop-up that comes up and obscures other content. Please make this an option to turn off. Thank you!",
        "It does what it's supposed to. All my nerdy, gaming news in one spot. Doesn't overburden you with ads. The 1-2 sentence Gamespot articles get annoying though. But you could just ignore them. Someone else 2 swipes down will be reporting the exact same thing",
        "Nice idea but the article tags are completely useless. GTA V articles are under the 3DS label, Splatoon 2 appears in the Xbox section. My Ps4 feed is made of articles tagged as Xbox 360 even though one of them is an article about the movie Wonder Woman 2... It's just useless. I am genuinely surprised when I find an article tagged correctly and in the correct feed.",
        "Notifications are broken!! Won't let me turn them on or off. It also doesn't even show articles when I click on them? So what's the point? It just says nothing available.",
        "I know this app for years.  But in the last few days, the only thing I can read are the top stories, because in the other sections it says \"no connection to network\". Why is that so? I have a Samsung S7"

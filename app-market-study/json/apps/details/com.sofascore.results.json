        "In the MOST recent update the \"Recent Form\" in the team's Detail tab has faced troubles it only shows a blank page! Pleeease fix it ASAP! It was your apps BEST feature!!",
        "Those blinking ads are disgusting , their is a setting to remove ads but again you need me to deep into my pocket ,haven't i? supported you ,when i download the app",
        "Using Sofascore on Windows platform was great for me but using it now on Android is way better than great;it's magnificent. I don't believe there's a better sport app around. Keep up the good work!",
        "Excellent app. The only thing I would wish for is that the default view be the same as the one from the last use of the app. The default view is not the best for me because I want to see the scores of all my favourites all at once.",
        "I love this app and especially i get a lot of info about football. But the problem is i can't share the page screenshot as in previous versions. Now i have to manually take screenshots and send it to my friends. Can you fix this plz...ðŸ˜Ÿ",
        "I use Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 and my android version is 7.1.1 NMF26X and the problem is for the notification sounds. i cant change the notification sounds here as the options are locked and not highlighted. On my previous Android sets i had the option to select notification sound for football matches which was classified into 3 types  \"match info\" had a different notification sound.. There was a different sound for \"scores\" and a different sound for \" half time\" or \"full time\". Now all sports have same notification sound and its difficult to understand what is happening which previously i could understand just by listening to the notification sound that whether it was lineups notification or notification of a goal scored. Please fix this problem because besides this the app is awesome and i only use this app to follow football scores. Please get a fix soon.Release an update for this problem and introduce these options as they are for other android versions because the notification sounds really help to understand whats going on even without opening the app."

        "I have been a member with commonwealth for a long time & I use this app alot. It's easy-to-use & track money. It be very nice if the commbank youthsaver app was able to be used on samsung mobile/tablet not just apple, so my child can keep track of her dollarmites account she has with her school ðŸ˜Ÿ",
        "Pretty great app. But can still be improved upon. You should still be able to logon without an internet connection. Set it up so that it still shows up your money and have the app update every hour. That way when your in an emergency situation and have no internet you can still see how much you had recently",
        "Solid banking app and the best I've used among the big banks. Tap & pay works well. Only small niggle is that a recent update changed the icon to an adaptive one that is just the old logo in a square now also in a white circle, looks a bit lazy and ugly.",
        "Hi CBA, the new spending tracker is a great feature, eliminates the need to use a seperate tracking app. One feedback would be to have credit expenses track against the actual date the expense was incurred instead of when it clears. Thanks!",
        "Worked fine until the stupid girl in one of the branches recommended I reinstall it. Only then did I find out I can't use the app any more because I have a net code token. Train your staff  to get it right cba. Now the app is junk because I can't log in without ditching the security token.",
        "I DID work on my S8+ but after an update 2 weeks ago it hasn't work since... i have reinstalled and restarted my phone... eftpos machine says invalid transaction... before this it was an awesome app"

        "Worked for the very first day. Then, could never play music again. Tried clearing cache and toggling playback options. No sound and jumps back to beginning of any song after 4 seconds. Tried emailing the developer about the problem, but never heard back.",
        "Update 11/2017 - This app used to be great over the last few years. Then during the summer it started crashing all the time! I'm listening to music, and then boom, it's gone! Updates haven't fixed it and it continues to crash.  :/  Using the S7.",
        "I love dsub and use it everyday. the only thing I'd like to see added is a category that has all cached content under it, with the usual options of playing/shuffling/adding to queue. Thanks, amazing app!",
        "Chromecast failed to load errors, using S8, Chromecast Ultra and Android Nougat.  Interface in not very intuitive.  I can connect to my  subsonic server and stream my mp3s though.  I really wanted to stream to chromecast though.  I'm sure SW Dev will eventually fix this.",
        "Update June 2017: The issue with skipping has been resolved. But now when I try and cast to a Chromecast Audio, I receive a Failed to Load message. This happens on both the S7 and the M8.  ++++++I've been using this app for a while, both on my S7 and now on my M8 that i'm using as a media streamer. On the M8, every now and again songs will skitter and skip. The M8 is wired to my network and my media server has tons of fire power and fast drives (7200+). I have gapless playback turned off and the cache is set to 2000 on an external SD card. Would be nice if this can get resolved.+++++",
        "Good app, much better than the original subsonic app. Only issue I have is that it will not play with Chromecast Audio, error message is displayed saying 'failed to load'. Would be excellent if fixed."

        "Confusing Great app, but menu seems confusing, nothing aimed at notification for just watch or just phone, just seen to be one does all. For me i need more control over notification sound vibrate and popups for each device.",
        "Fantastic! The amount of times I forget my phone or not sure where I left is slightly embarrassing. But with this app, I can find it really easy. It even let's me know when I'm out of range.",
        "Connection App would not recognize that phone was connected to watch. Had to use another app I found.",
        "Like it But one more thing! Add mute it for some time. Like for 30 mins or one hour",
        "Keeps crashing. It crashes on the watch.  It crashes on phone 10 times per day.  Annoying.",
        "Trial wear They need to be more clear about the fact that this app expires and needs to be purchased."

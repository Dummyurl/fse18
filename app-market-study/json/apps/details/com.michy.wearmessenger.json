IF YOUR ANTIVIRUS SAYS THERE IS, IT'S A FALSE POSITIVE (please, get a better antivirus!) ***Wear Messenger is an app which greatly expands your ways to send SMS messages with your fingers.Quick access to your conversations.With Wear Messenger, you have all your conversations one touch away. You can see what your buddy said or reply to him while leaving your phone in your pocket.Multiple input methods.Wear Messenger can accept voice input, quick replies (that you can freely set up), has an emoji list (accessible long-pressing the quick replies button), includes four different keyboards and supports third party IMEs, such as Minuum, iBeezi (let's type chinese fast!) and TouchOne (the award-winning dedicated smartwatch keyboard with enhanced features from the T9 predictive keyboard).Dictionaries.The phone keypad keyboard features dictionaries and gestures which will greatly speed up your typing. Gestures includes:• Left->Right: Space/Enter• Right->Left: Back• Top->Bottom: Reset• Bottom->Top: Change languageIncludes FlickKey technology.A new way to type has landed on your watch. The reason we choose to have FlickKey on board is because we truly believe gestures are the way to go on Android Wear. To \"flick\" a letter, you simply touch the square it is within and move your finger in its direction, then release. It's easy, fast and accurate. The same principle was applied to Flick Calc and to the FlickKey IME with awesome results. For more informations about FlickKey and their feature-rich IME, visit flickkey.com or email support@flickkey.com .Notifications.Your SMS app does not support android wear, or you are not comfortable with voice input? No problem! Wear Messenger can provide notifications effectively replacing your standard SMS app. Its notification features include High resolution profile pictures, stacked notifications, conversation history, ringtone support, mark as read (Android 4.3 or Xposed only) and all the input methods listed above.Last but not least, you can link your client's notifications with Wear Messenger's, so whenever you swipe them away on your watch or your phone, they get dismissed on the other part too. Remember to blacklist your SMS client into the Android Wear management app, or you will get double notifications. (Works best on 4.4+, might not be compatible with all clients)Customizability.You can customize pretty much everything this app does. From vibration patterns, to which buttons should the keyboards have (or not). You can also use the legacy UI if you don't like our Material inspired one.Address book access.Wear Messenger now can bring your address book to your watch. You can start a new conversation or launch a call directly from your watch. And if the number you want is not in your address book, you can type it on the dial pad.Random facts.Please check the web site page to get all the answers you may need.

        "Works Great! I love the ability to send messages without taking my phone out our having to talk. I was having trouble getting the message to send as the send icon was on the edge of the screen where my watch face is not as responsive. The developer was quick to respond and let me know I could send  simply holding the message window, which works perfectly. I have the Moto 360  2nd Gen and am using the  FlickKey keyboard.",
        "Great app but could improve I really like the ability to answer directly from the watch with this app. However, I have been comparing it to my default messaging app, and I noticed how this app only allows you to see the last message received. Also, there is no quick shortcut to view the entire conversation after getting a notification. Adding those features would make this the perfect messenger app! Could these be added? Thanks!",
        "Just a few more things I wish the voice dictation auto capitalized the beginning of sentences, and that the delete key had a bigger hit box. Like I said it only needs a few more things. It looks beautiful on my Lg G Watch though.",
        "Just got it and have been using it for about a day now. Love it. I do wish when you dismiss a text on the watch the notification would go away on the phone but not a big deal. Other than that, works great. No crashes, bugs or glitches so far. Reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it doesn't let you personalize quick replies for certain contacts.  Again not a huge deal but something that would definitely be really usefull. Would say this app and coffee when it comes back will definitely be the 2 to beat",
        "My only complaint is, when you enter the text conversation the most recent texts are listed at the bottom... There should be a way to change the order so the newest parts of the message thread are at the top",
        "Like the app. Wish it would show a picture of the MMS sent like my prior app. Group messages show up as a MMS but u don't know if someone sent a pix or it's a group message  Update if someone sends u multiple texts rapid fire u usually don't get the first one. It's like the second takes over. Can u if this? Didn't have this issue with textra. Really becoming an issue. Only see second of 2 texts from person if both sent back to back. This and MMS view would raisenit to 5 stars."

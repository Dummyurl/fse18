        "Best invention since sliced bread. Havent stopped fapping since I got this. God bless the devs and god bless America. Thank you so much use this app on the daily. #thefappening #whoneedsthegym? #kateupton also it would be hella tight if you could make a watchface and replace all the numbers with fap so it says its fapping time or have an analog clock with the seconds hand designed as a fist and its stuck so it looks like its fapping :) anyways thank you and bye ; D #whoneedsagirlfriend? #igotmyhand #wheredoesthelotiongo? #honestlythebestapp",

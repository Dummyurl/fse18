        "Unreliable, they've sent me six hubs over three years. The devices drop off every six or seven months - not battery issues - rather antenna failures. This thing has had complete failures RIGHT BEFORE I've left town three times now - like for month stretches. Stay away. I work in security and surveillance as well as integration. I get it. It sucks.",
        "Been using this system for 2 years now. app works as it should",
        "Been 3 years now. I gave it a good chance. Not going to be renewing my subscription. Very buggy system, unreliable, false alarms, logs me out constantly, keyfobs are squirrelly, EATS batteries (and free batteries are not the answer) re-pairing motion detector is a chore when it goes awry. The list goes on. Just can't recommend this system.",
        "Bought new Android with lollipop o\\s, no more tone or popup text informing me system Is armed as it did with iphone. Even that took some time with Scout support to correct. Apparently Android and Apple don,t perform the same way with this app.",
        "The new app looks great with its cleaner interface. I haven't had any issues with the app in a long time. I even recently setup Alexa with it. It works really well with Alexa. Very pleased.",
        "The new version isn't working well with the S8 phone.  The previous version was much better. Constant issues with arming and disarming the systemusing the app"

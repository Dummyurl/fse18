        "Absolutely Mind blowing When I first opened this app, I wasn't sure what to expect. But when I flipped the coin for the first time, I was shocked. The flawless flipping animation is the cream of the crop when it comes to coin flipping applications. All in all,  this app blew my mind. Thank you for helping me with all my coin flipping needs. This saved my marriage!",
        "Almost didn't install - Glad I did I wasn't sure if this app would be useful or not, so I flipped a real coin and it said \" yes\". I'm happily leaving all important to my watch from now on. What could go wrong?",
        "Useful This is useful but the 5 second wait feels too long. It would be nice if the wait was customizable.",
        "Awesome! Just exactly what I wanted!",
        "Like it says. Simple with no fuss.  Thanks!"

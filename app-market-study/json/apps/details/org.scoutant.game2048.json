        "Good app, but... If I leave the app at the screen I last see for a few days, it freezes, and I have to wait at least 15 minutes for the app to work. Really annoys me when it's at the game over screen because it's even more harder to fix. Overall, you delivered what you promised, but the lag is not fun",
        "Works well enough, even if it is a little laggy... But I'd like if I could remove the useless launcher shortcut on my home screen. Doesn't really do much, and just kind of sits there taking up space in my app drawer.",
        "I love the game I hate the app icon. It is ugly and horrible to look at. That also applies to the menu icons.",
        "Can not reset game The button to reset the game is broken/impossible to click Moto 360 2015",
        "Can't win? I got to 2048 but I didn't win, so I just played until I got another 2048 but then when I put them together the game crashed.",
        "Great game This is BY FAR my favorite game on my watch, a great time waster!"

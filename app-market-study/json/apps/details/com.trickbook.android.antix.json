        "I just downloaded this app and tried it immediately. I like how simple and easy it is to use. But I think it needs a lot of improvement in the future update. Let me name some!  *muting option. *the video clip is limited eventhough I have trimmed all of my clips. *when you select a music, it does nothing. *option to insert your own music. *option to apply different filter from diferrent clip (this one is objective because I wasn't able to watch my final video. But I just noticed that if you select a filter from a clip, the same filter applies to the next clip even if you already selected a filter for it.  Guys, this is an amazing app. Only if you could provide those that I have mentioned. I would love to give this a 5 star rating soon.",
        "Haven't been able to use it for my purpose. I have a Gopro and used the Time Lapse feature to film while painting a large mural. I have moved all the photos into my Samsung TabS2 Gallery. After tap \"+\" then \"Gallery\" nothing shows. I know the pics are there, other editing apps can find them fine. I double checked permissions and Antix has full permissions. Couldn't find troubleshoot anywhere. Maybe someone here has had similar issue and knows fix. Thanks",

Concern about the energy impact?Our tests showed that it can easily run continuously for more than 3 hours and a half on a smartwatch and far more on a regular device. Most consumed energy is in fact taken by the screen, not by the app itself.    About RECORD_AUDIO permissionNeeded only to acquire audio from the microphone in order to generate the visualization reacting to the sound. Nothing is saved at all.",

        "I've been using the Android wear app for almost a year but I've never tried the phone version, maybe it's new? I think it's incredible, even the free visualizers make this a must download for me. I'm going to be purchasing a pack or two soon.  Both the phone version on my Galaxy S8+ and the Android wear version on my Huawei Watch are incredibly smooth and accurate. The app feels very polished and oddly pleasing with its smooth graphics. I'm not exaggerating about how good it looks on Android wear, no other app other custom watch faces work as smooth or look as nice. On my giant Galaxy S8 plus, Full screen mode is nice and I plan to use it a lot to show off.",
        "95% of the faces must be purchased. But there is lot of customization. The author of this app would profit from being a little more lose with paying for that faces. Personally, I uninstalled immediately after seeing all of the purchaseable faces.",
        "I hate this scam! I bought all the effects yesterday and today they're all gone and it says I have to buy them again!!",
        "Love it so far. I just wish it had the option for camera orbit around some of the 3D spectrums.",

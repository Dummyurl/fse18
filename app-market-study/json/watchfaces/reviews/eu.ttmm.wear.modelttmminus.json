I know it would ruin the minimalistic design to add date but it doesn't have to. I fill out a lot of paperwork at my job and am constantly checking the date so I don't screw up forms.  P.S. works flawlessly on a Moto 360 2nd gen.  -Great Design.",

Literally, about an hour later, I casually (quickly) glanced at the face and knew what time it was. Right after I looked away, I had a WTF moment as it dawned on me that I didn't have to think at all. An amazingly intuitive design!  I do find one thing a little annoying, which cost the app a star: even right after reboot (no apps running), it often stutters on wake, taking a sec to update the time (moto360 1st gen).",

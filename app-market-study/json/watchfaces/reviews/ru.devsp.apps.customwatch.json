Secondly - the battery indicator isn't as customizable and it shows. You can't select percentage only, can't change size or font, you can't move it.... The watch face and app also crash occasionally, wound up having a black screen as a watch face once. Using this on a moto 360 1. If these things get fixed I give it a 5 :)",

I would love to see more functionality added, a nicer transition into ambient mode and more ambient options. It also really works well with the moto 360 flat tyre as this can ruin most faces really.",

I would love it of I could play a small sample of the in-menu music to GoldenEye when I raise my watch up but no matter how short I make it no sound ever comes through, BUT I understand that's still I'm beta so no stars subtracted.

Personalization is super easy and the \"health\" and \"body armor\" gauges show battery life of phone AND watch. Insane.  I will likely keep it on this for a looooong time. Thanks!!!",

Lo and behold Tha Phlash is still killing em with the freshest, most realistic, and well designed faces. From the tiny details to function he's killing em all! Just coped that Super too from ur site that's what's up! Will definitely buy more. Have like 6 of his already. Lol.",

        "comment": "I installed it and the face was nice. However, I could not find anywhere to modify it. Nothing showed up on my phone (nexus 6) and when looking at the face on my watch  there wasn't a gear to modify it. This was basically a what you see is what you get. No extra colors or launching of apps and etc. Maybe it was a fluke I don't know. I can say that the only option when viewing in the play store was refund. Typically there is an open option. Sorry for the 1 star but it is what it is and that is non-functional",

I checked my gearwear app, apps and everywhere possible. It does show up in my app manager but I cant use it from there. Got my refund. Worthless.",

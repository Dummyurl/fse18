Maybe even an analog clock option similar to the Timer/stopwatch feature in the timely app? Anyways, Really liking this and I am looking forward to future updates!",

I don't know what changed, it suddenly started being a battery hog, using just over 91% of my battery. Had to uninstall because it was getting down to &lt;10% after a typical work day, dying during my shift more than once.",

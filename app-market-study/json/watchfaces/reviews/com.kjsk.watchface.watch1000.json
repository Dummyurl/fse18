I prefer digital, as watch hands are not always easy to see in a fast paced work environment. I love that you can change the font and time position, however, I wish you could change the color of the writing, as white doesn't show on all faces. Additionally wish you could change font size to bigger or smaller. Also, top and bottom positioning are VERY top and bottom, which doesn't look great on a round face watch.",

The watch faces are beautiful, bright and colorful, with lots of categories to choose from. I noticed in the update that we now have the ability to add other functions to the watch face, like battery level, weather, etc., but I haven't been able to figure out how to do that.   Otherwise,, the app is perfect for me, my ZenWatch 3 smart watch and my OnePlus 3 smart phone! Thanks!  Update:  I emailed the app developer and got an answer right away, on how to add the additional functions to my watch face.  It only works with Android Wear 2.0, which I have.  (Swipe left to see watch faces, when you see 1000+ Watch Face, there is a gear icon at bottom.  Press this and you'll see a preview of watch face with two + signs.  Press each on and select option you want for that icon from the list.)  BINGO!  It works!  Perfect app for my needs!  Highly recommend!",

The only problems I have had has been with updates with android wear and this app updating causing the watch to stop working with both apps.  The developer is good enough to help as much as he can although sometimes you can get lost in the instructions.",

It showed what I needed (including some things I hadn't thought of needing, like battery levels), clearly and simply. The developer keeps adding even better functions - music control and now Tasker integration, among the highlights! Still simple and functional, and getting better all the time.",

Stable, feature rich, yet easy to use - even for someone like me with not too much technical background. Very good integration of AW 2 complications and notification handling.

        "comment": "Fantastic watch face. I have two minor suggestions, both related to ambient mode. An option for a \"higher quality\" that shows the texture background and better graphics in ambient mode would be nice. Obviously this would drain more battery, but the g watch r and urbane batteries are monsters and could most likely handle it. Additionally, there is a bug with the burn in prevention and colors. One of the dots got moved almost off of the screen and turned red rather than my defined color of mustard.",

No response. sent another asking for refund, few days later told no refunds after DL. Exactly when would you refund. You can't refund before a DL, there is no charge for looking at it... Not a good policy to give no refunds if you lost under search terms that lead to your product but do not work on it. Bought in good faith, not a good faith developer. Keep the couple dollars and the rating.",

        "comment": "Hi. I purchased some of your premium watchfaces, including this one for my Fossil Q Marshal Android Wear 2.0. I just recently picked up a Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch. I noticed Samsung uses Tizen OS, different from ANDROID. I found almost all the watchfaces I already purchased from you on the Samsung Gear store, but it asked me to pay for them again. Is there any way for me to download all my watchfaces from Android Wear 2.0 to my Samsung Gear S3 for free without having to pay for all of them again in the Samsung Gear store, since I already payed for them on Android? Thanks!",

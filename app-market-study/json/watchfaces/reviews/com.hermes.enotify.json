Definitely recommend this app. One thing I do wish fixed is the length of time notification bar shows the exclamation mark before it disappears. I have to quickly get to my device before the alert in the notification bar disappears. If I miss it then I have to try to catch it during the next alert cycle. It has kinda become a game now. lol. Regardless it a good app and I hope one day Glen can include missed call alerts as well",

Just configure it to alert you to those specific messages that require your immediate attention and bammm... people will be amazed how fast you react. Being on call has never been so low stress. It's also nice to see that the app is being actively developed and improved. Blown away!",

Just one suggestion - can u add text to speach features e.g. when i get a pop up with message content the app reads it aloud so i dont have to look at the screen. Once the message is read aloud the app automaticaly processes and reads aloud the next message etc.                          --------      Thank you Glen i found and tested the text to speach option and can say this app is truly indispensable and fills an important void",

Paid because we wanted to be able to export a CSV file to print and take shopping so we wouldn't buy the same LP twice. Waste of money and the time it took to inventory 1500 LPs and CDs!!",

I would give it 5 stars if there was an option for sorting via release date and record label. An option for creating you're sorting category would also be useful.  Overall, I would recommend this app. Keep up the good work.",

I have too many CDs to type them all in manually. Would be good if you could select an artist and choose multiple albums. Even failed to find Dark Side of the Moon, I mean come on!",

Then I realised that you can only sort it by entry date or alphabetically (artist-album). Search feature not great. There are many apps that offer more potential. Just that I find they ALL don't do a good enough job.",

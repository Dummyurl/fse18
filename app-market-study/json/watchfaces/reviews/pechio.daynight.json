Beautiful and simple interface on watch for settings and a clean looking watch face have earned this a 5 star rating from me.  I looked for a good material design watch face long ago, and this one fits exactly what I was looking for.  It seems to be good on battery life, although I will wouldn't be upset to have a phone battery indicator in addition to the watch battery.",

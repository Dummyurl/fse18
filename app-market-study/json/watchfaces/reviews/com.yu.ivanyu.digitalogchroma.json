        "comment": "Very nice watch face. May I ask for the following additions: 1. Allow numeric values. Sliders are tricky to sync between settings (e.g. minute and ticker lengths). 2. Allow HEX, RGB or any other color code where color inputs exist. Same reason as above.  3. Add width for tickers, same as there is such a setting for minute.",

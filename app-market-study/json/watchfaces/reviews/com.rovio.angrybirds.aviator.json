Only gripe I have, is that I can't change the shape of the watch hands, and the outer numbers around the clock, but other than that its looking rather good!",

It does have some kind of quirk about changing the different birds but it just took a couple of things to get it on whichever one I wanted. It's really polished looking down to the little details. I'm not sure if the anger meter is anything but random so it would be nice to have it hooked into something like heart rate or battery level. Nice to see the big boys making a free watch face!",

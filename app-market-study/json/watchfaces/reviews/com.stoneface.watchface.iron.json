Namely, a choice as to what is displayed and where, units, date format choices, etc... I'm not going to go and say that it needs touch actions, but that would be nice to see as well!",

I don't mind the blue, but it would be nice to have some other color options to mix things up.  Overall pretty good watchface.",

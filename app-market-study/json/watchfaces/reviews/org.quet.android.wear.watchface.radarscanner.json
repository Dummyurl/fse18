        "comment": "I'd like a option to have the glitch go on/off at set time intervals when the screen is on instead of only the option of when it turns on. I'd also like options to show the watch and phone battery levels and a digital clock option along with options to leave some of the glitch fx on all the time when watch is on (scan lines) I'd also like to be able to edit how long the watch hands are in analogue and change the speed of the sweeping scanner effect and have a ticking option for the second hand.",

That and the \"created by\" text. Nobody is going to remember your company name from a watch face you have to be 3 inches away from to read. All it does is make the watch face seem cheap, feels like an advertisement. Put the date on the face, shaking your wrist is stupid. Stop creating gimmicks. You have a good thing here if you'd listen to your users.",

Such as today he was red & said Jan. 1, 2015. Now he is blue & says the date is Wed. the 31st. Please help my bear I don't want to use the other watch faces....but he is just so darn cute & I love the colors of the watch face! Can you please help my bear? I'm more than willing to pay if you can fix him :-) I am using this face on a ZenWatch & Galaxy Gear Live if that info helps.",

One other problem I have is that the watch is supposed to show both zulu and roaming time - mine just shows zulu in both display areas. I would appreciate any hints on how to fix that?  Also when roaming the weather display is blank.  So because of those three niggles I can only give it 3",

Not sure the cause of the delay.  It's a little \"busy\" but displays the info I need to have handy when at work. I wish I could change the \"on\" colors to something more visible in daylight than green.  But other than that, it does what I need.",

Areas for improvement are: 1) Increase the polling time for speed and altitude (I'm going to be zooming!) 2) Remove the second hand for secondary clock (no point imo) 3) vibration feature if bad weather detected within next 3 hours in your location. 4) Touch points to open custom apps like skitracks, maps, weather, or zello. Thanks!",

I want a refund but since devs won't even respond for support it's unlikely. Would be the best face I've found if it worked but it doesn't. Be warned spend your money elsewhere. Shame I wanted a bunch of other watch faces from these guys but I've lost faith.",

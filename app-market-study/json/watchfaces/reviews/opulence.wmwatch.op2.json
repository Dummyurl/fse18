Fit and Music) otherwise I get crashes on one or more of these apps.",

Haven't found a way to change the temperature display to Fahrenheit. Don't know if I'm missing something or if it's just not there yet... no worries. This one is so well done, I really can't complain. Love being able to modify without going into settings- this is how a smartwatch watch face should work!!  Update- Aha! I'm new to Watchmaker, so i didn't think to look there. No need to move it since it's something likely to be set only once. All the other onscreen tap changes are the sort of thing one might want to change now and then. Speaking of onscreen 'tap' controls- what's the easiest means to get past them and tap through to, say, the watch face list or functions? I've done it accidentally a couple times, but haven't figured out the pattern.   One feature request- the ability to change the color that follows the sweep second hand around the perimeter to follow the minute hand instead.   Once again- a brilliant design. Complicated, but in a good, well thought out way thanks to nice touches batt level color coding.",

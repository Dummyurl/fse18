We'll see how it affects battery life, I'll update my review later. So far it's worth it. ************************** UPDATE: AFTER MOVING TO 5.1.1 I HAVE TWO \"FLAT TIRE\" ISSUES INSTEAD OF JUST THE ONE AND THE PARALAX EFFECT IS GONE.  Please address. Is it still a Motorola issue six months later?",

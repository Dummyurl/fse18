I have no use for the \"week\" portion of the display, and it would be helpful if this face had a battery percentage of your phone displayed.  It would be perfect if I had the option to display phone battery percentage in the spot that \"week\" currently uses.  That would earn a 5 star from me.",

When you turn the watch up towards your face to see the time, the cool watch face does not display. Instead, a black and white version shows up for about 0.8 seconds. Then and only then does the cool watch face show up.  I want to show my associates what a cool device the Moto 360 is but after I show them they always say; \"What's with the black and white image that shows up before the face comes up.\"  The developer asked another reviewer who complained about the same problem; \"Thank you for your feedback. I'd like to improve. Let me confirm, how many seconds or longer is it stay at the dimmed mode? Thank you\"  As if he or she was not aware of the issue. It is so glaring, Plus it is not dim, it is a bright as bright can be black and white \"ghost\" of the wonderful face.  I can't believe anyone could miss it. So I have to go back to another face so I can show off my Moto 360. I did not ask for a refund because the face is very cutting edge and I figured it would be fixed.",

When it comes back on still show the watchface as white as ambient light was on and the 2 second after it goes to the regular watchface. It is kind of annoying. Can you fix it. Same issues with your other A watchface a bought. This does not happen on build in moto watchfaces.Thanks",

Every time my watch turns on, it first shows the black and white version for a second and then goes to full version. Very annoying,  costing a star in my opinion. Otherwise really great job.",

I am having the same issue with the lag from the sleep mode to the watch showing the full interface.  I was able to make it less glaring by changing the wake filter to green, rather than the default black and white.  Hopefully the developers will update the app to remove the lag.",

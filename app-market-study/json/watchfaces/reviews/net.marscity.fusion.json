Still gets 5 stars though as I'm sure this will get better with time. -- Didn't see a reply option so adding to this.  I am giving that a try actually, that is some impressive battery life.  Also uninstalled some stuff that might be running as well. Its possible that it just uses more than my previous watch face app and I have to adjust slightly to be able to use yours.  Which to recap is awesome.",

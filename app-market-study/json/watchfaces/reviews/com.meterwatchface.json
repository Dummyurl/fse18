No option/settings either so right now I'm not going to use it. Will keep checking back though cos I like the concept. Could incorporate step counter...? Edit: reply to response - just checked again on my SW3, on all brightness settings the whitest white is yellow. Can email a picture if you require....",

I love how the face is dark until you need to check the time, then it becomes black on white and the seconds appear making the most of your battery with an OLED display. This is simple and makes the most use out of the real estate of a square face, using with a Polar M600.",

Thank you developer for such a elegant work. Could you use the empty space at top to indicate battery level? Also how come I can't choose white on black on my Moto 360?  Thanks.",

Living in San Diego   I am fairly certain it's not going to rain for the next 3 weeks straight,  and it's not 82\u00b0 at 8pm in February.  Inaccurate weather can be a deal breaker for most smart watch owners.  Fix the weather problem and I give 5 stars.",

Restarted both my watch and my Note5.  Uninstalled and reinstalled.  Nothing works, unfortunately.  The developer was sympathetic but unable to solve the problem.  This happened on several other of their lovely watch faces.  Only \"Ticker\" worked.  Note that most watch faces I have tried have downloaded with no problems.",

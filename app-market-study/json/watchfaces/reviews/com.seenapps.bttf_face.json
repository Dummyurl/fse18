You could tell there's been careful attention paid to the scaling because one of the biggest problems you have with digital numbers in different colors in such close proximity is that it can get tricky to read at a quick glance but no problems here. Also like the fact you can set the \"destination time\" to a different time zone. I've got mine set to my boss's time zone so I know when he'll be signing in to work remotely :D.",

Seriously my only complaint.  Second complaint: after using it for a while. Step tracker icon on watch isn't updating. Fit updates on my phone but the watch always displays 0 steps.  Using Nexus 6 and Zenwatch 2.",

I wish it had more options, like to enable or disable the digital clock, the battery, or the date. Otherwise, I love the simplicity, just that jagged lines problem.",

My issue is that the steps often do not always tally-up with the app on my phone (Sony Xperia). If I switch the face back to \u2018Essential\u2019 which is supplied as default the steps are the same. I don\u2019t know where this face gets it step count from but not being accurate is annoying. Other than that, I really do like this face.",

It was a little difficult to figure out BUT once I did I quit paying any attention to it!  I LIKE the Time Front and Center and HIGH with the upper part of the Round Face.  Would recommend buying this  Watch Face for the Moto 360 (1st Version - can't wait for the \"newly improved (battery life) version to be related later this year, I understand.",

I would have kept this one as it looks great as is, but I didn't have the option of setting a second time zone (using the digital for this would be great) and I do too much work with clients overseas. Weather would be a nice option as well.",

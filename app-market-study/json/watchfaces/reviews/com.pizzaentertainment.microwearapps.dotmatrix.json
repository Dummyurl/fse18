Without better contrast time is very difficult to read. Also passive screen is useless since background dots and number are all the same intensity.",

Plugged in my 360 last night, it appeared charged in the morning when I took it off the charger... then when I was about to leave for work, it wouldn't turn on...  I ended up putting it back on the dock only to see it had zero charge...  after I got home from work, I attempted to charge it again, and it was literally struggling.  It went up to only 13%, then started to decline while on the charger...  uninstalled and now it's charging.",

Also, it seems a little blur on Huawei Watch, i am not sure whether it is related to the resolution of the textures used by the app.",

If you enable this option after ten seconds while screen is on it will enter in \"black mode\".\n\nHope it helped you.",

In watch design, though, it is usually the case that the notation IIII, although incorrect, is chosen for being it more plain and smooth to the rest of the elements in the sphere.\n\nThanks a lot for liking our watch faces!",

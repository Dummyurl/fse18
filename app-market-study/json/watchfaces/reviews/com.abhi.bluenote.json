Just a little suggestion, can you guys make a thumbnail view of the notes? It would be awesome since some people love squares/rectangles (I love it). The tagging is good but I think foldrs/ntbks is muchmuch better. It would be great if u can enable/disable the time and dates displayed on the notes. And themes. And fonts too.",

(this is the main premium feature, so it NEEDS to be fixed asap). It also as a bug where tag synchronizations between two devices doesn't occur (save one tag in a phone, it doesn't show up in your tablet). Really nice app, anyway: material design, beautiful transitions, tags, CALENDAR... I mean, what else could you ask? Please please fix it",

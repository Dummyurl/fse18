I tried to \"reload\" and I still get the same error. This is when both devices are connected to the same wi-fi that is not \"low\". The watchface is set to the default location set by the developer and is thus useless for knowing the weather for my area.  This is the second watchface that I have had problems with from this developer.",

I sent an email, and still haven't received a reply, after 3 days.  My review will remain a 1 star.  And I'm glad I could contribute to your bank account. ***",

The current location was just HTML error text, and when in ambient mode, the info doesn't update at all. Also, there's no settings for ambient mode. So if the wallpaper is active, it shows the full image even in ambient. This makes it hard to read on most watches, and eats battery on the round LG watches. It needs an option for wallpaper in active mode, black background in ambient.",

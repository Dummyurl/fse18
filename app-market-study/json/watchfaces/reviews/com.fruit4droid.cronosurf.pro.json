Always on Screen but with a dim screen to save battery life. 3. can be made to be part of watch faces on standalone android watches. \u00a0 I hope all these will be possible on your next update. \u00a0 thank you.",

I still can't fantom why there aren't more of these and in this quality. I mean, look at the great smartwatch designs nowadays, but still none of those for a smartphone. Only this one and it looks great and has loads of UI gadgets crammed into it in such a way a real watchmaker would be jealous :)",

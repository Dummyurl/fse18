The phone app offers a good amount of customization, allowing you to turn down or off the 3D effects, alter the graininess and frequency of static and do a few other things.    My only complaint is that, like a lot of heavily animated watch faces, it seems to be a real battery vampire, even with the 3D effects turned off.",

To reduce CPU and battery usage, the best way is to lower the density using \"Density\" option in \"Quality/Speed/3D\" section. If you lower the density, you may have to increase the contrast.",

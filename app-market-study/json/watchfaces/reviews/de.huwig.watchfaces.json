With Samsung Gear Live watch the clock screen stays on all the time but to save power it dims the screen then changing the colors of the watch face to black and white, this of course works perfect with the watch faces included with the watch.  However in this product many of the watch faces, including LCARS, dim fine but instead of going to black and white they change to some funky ugly colors.  I would increase my rating if all the watches faces offer the correct black and white colors for the lower power setting on the Samsung Gear Live watch.",

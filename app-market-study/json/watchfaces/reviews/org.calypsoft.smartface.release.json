You don't need to customize each event.\nI am really sorry that the mobile app crashed. It is due to a missing special permission to read photos on the SD card. We just have delivered a fix thanks to you.\nAbout your watch issue could you tell us more ?",

Pictures are downscaled if necessary to fit your watch screen resolution.\nSmartFace is tested on different screen resolutions: moto 360, gwatch, gear live. Could you try to pick your pictures with a different image gallery?\nOtherwise please contact me on http://en.smartface.watch/contact-us/ ?",

I don't know how they did it but this has seriously made me love my watch even more, more than any other app I've downloaded because a big problem for me is how quickly the battery gets drained. I've been following Emerald Software for its past few releases and I must say that I am very impressed with the quality of the apps they produce. Big thanks to the team!",

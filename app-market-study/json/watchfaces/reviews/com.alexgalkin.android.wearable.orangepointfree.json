        "comment": "I like your watch face. But I found a few issues on using it. First, the watch face sometimes remains in active one even in ambient mode. The screen brightness is getting reduced, but the watch face itself remains in normal one. It changes to the ambient watch face after a minute or so. If it is intended, it would be fine. But I guess it isn't intended. Second, the minute needle comes above the hour needle. I think it is more practical to put the hour needle on top of minute needle because it is shorter and doesn't cause any issue on reading both hour and minute. Currently, if two needles are overlapped, the hour needle doesn't show up and it is sometimes confusing.",

We've never got similar issue on our devices and would very appreciate if you tell us your watch model. Anyway we'll do additional tests. \n2. It is classic approach. We'll try to find a solution to get an hour hand visible when overlapped with a minute hand.",

I have an Asus ZenWatch, so it is square, and I do have to echo a prior reviewers comment about it looking a little strange on the Square face. Perhaps introducing not only the option to change colors, but also change the clock outline to square or circle, user choice. I think that would be awesome. Also, adding the date would be great, too. Both improvements would make it 5 stars for me. Keep up the good work!",

There are already some plans for future updates, so you can expect what you're asking for :) Thanks, Maciej.",

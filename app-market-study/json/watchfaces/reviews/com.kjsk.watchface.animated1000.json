For those whom it didn't worked can try following: 1.Check if App is installed in watch as well. If not install from play store on watch. 2. From Android wear or from watch set this watch face. It will have default cycle animation. 3. Now select desired watch face on mobile. I select standard quality and it works pretty well.",

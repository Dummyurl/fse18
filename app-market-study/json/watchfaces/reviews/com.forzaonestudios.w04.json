All the features in the App description work, and perhaps even better than is obvious, they work GREAT. I switched my watch & phone battery indicators to percentages (instead of bars) as I wanted precision.  I'm using a blue background - it shows up great (and power saver ambient mode shows up great too).  Instead of a 2nd time zone in the top right circle - I chose the moon phase, very nice. IF this looks like the watch you want - I suspect and hope you are as satisfied as I am!  LOVE IT!",

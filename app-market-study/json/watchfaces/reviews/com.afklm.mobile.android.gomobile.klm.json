I am giving a poor review because I have received poor customer and rude customer service agents. I thought they were a reputable airline but my experience has been the worst airline experience I have ever had. I worked for Canadian airlines and have flown some pretty crappy airlines. KLMS flights were fine when they haven't been cancelled or delayed. But the customer care for all of their excuses has been a solid 1 out of 5. So that is what I am giving the app. KLM you need to do a better job compensating customers who have suffered due to your incompetence. I can overlook one error bur not multiple. I hope someone from KLM looks at this. I will continue to share my story with friends and family on how bad my experience has been flying with KLM.",

For KLM flights I would rate even 5 stars but it is annoying that the app doesn't work in US and you will be diverted to the Delta site which gives you many limitations and at times you cannot do mobile check in and you need to go to the counter! Similar issues happened with Air France operated flights and AF was not helping at all. Great App for all KLM operated flights but big limitations with flights operated by partners.",

Had to get a physical boarding pass because the app won't retrieve it!  That one thing this app must do, failsafe, it does fail! Going to install the AF one..",

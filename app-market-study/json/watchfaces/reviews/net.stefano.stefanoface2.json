It's a little hard to figure out how save, share and transfer, but with a little work, everything turns out fine. ONLY, I can't transfer from my phone to my watch. I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything right, but I just can't transfer the face I just customized to my watch. Doesn't matter how many different times I try, nothing appears on my \"user presets\" face.",

My primary watch face is the Bubble cloud app, that app is way more than just a face, it's a app launcher, watch face, and way way more. But I've always searched for secondary faces, for when I want just a good looking face. I settled on Pujie Black, I had some nice faces from them. But still... I was always still searching for elegant, real looking watch faces. This app hit the nail on the head! These faces look stunning, and they look like actual real watches. I have now the Zenwatch 3 in black. So the black and gold faces from this app look like my watch came with it. It looks made for my watch. Looks....prefect! I wish I could attach a screenshot image here, but I see no option here to do that. Oh well. Treasure my word for it, it looks really good. Thanks for the great work guys",

Truly a great app and I appreciate the quick feedback from the developer even though I ended up figuring out the problem as I was sending them an email! (this was when I  re-opened the watch face, it asked for the weather permission and I accepted and the Heart Rate feature started to work)",

Although it is a bit complicated with all the user setups which I didn't master yet, however I thunk it is missing one major functionality which is the ability to assign shortcuts anywhere else than the dials. Im the developer will add soon as I see him active in responses and updates.",

If you f.e. use a 4 dial fixed layout (in the dial config menu) but only use the 6 and 9 o'clock positions (dial 1 and 2) you can still assign shortcuts to the empty 12 and 3 o'clock positions. There is also an active G+ community for sharing info,presets,questions on UW2.",

Most other apps offer far less for considerably more money.  In addition, I had a few questions about some of the features, and received incredible technical support from Stefan.  He was very persistent in helping me understand the best way to accomplish what I was trying to do.  I'd give this app 10 stars if I could.  Buy it Today!!",

First of all, the custom backgrounds are heavily degraded and secondly, the backgrounds don't scroll (is it called parallax?) with swipes even when a larger size is used as a crop. In fact the crop looks even more degraded! But that's nothing that can't be fixed with an update! Best of luck, looking forward to bug fixes :)",

It looks messy when notifications are showing or music info for whatever I am playing. If that gets changed this is an instant 5 star. EDIT IN RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER REPLY - Was not negotiating for stars at all, simply giving reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars in case anyone else was interested in buying it and wanted an honest review as for me that issue is a deal breaker.",

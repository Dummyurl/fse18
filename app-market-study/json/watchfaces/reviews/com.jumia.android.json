My goods were returned by one of them to the store and my order cancelled while I was still awaiting delivery and refund is yet to be received after two months, it's really frustrating sometimes.",

That's y i simply look for an item on jumia, check specs,check prices, then i simply go to any best shop selling the same item and bargain downwards. Hence don't pay those hefty delivery charges. I have used jumia for 5yrs. But starting 2018 have changed tact.",

This is not encouraging at all, I really love this app but one thing is, people consider shipping fees before  shopping and I really don't know what happened. Still the best shopping app though but I like the old Jumia.",

That's when I got discouraged and cancelled all orders and deleted the app.  If its Konga am ordering from I pay on delivery and I can still reject items delivered if its not like what I saw online. Konga charges their normal shipping fee if am ordering once and all the items are weightless.",

        "comment": "I really like Jumia, but I'm giving this app 3 stars because of the annoying and very frequent on-screen pop ups that you cannot turn off, always appearing on my screen when im busy doing my work. Please change this, it's annoying enough to make me consider uninstalling the app and using the online site instead. Change this and it's an easy 5 stars from me.",

Haha I spent 15 minutes changing all kinds of colors around until I flicked nighttime to day and it was almost exactly what I wanted aside from some widget changes. The daytime is just much closer to what their symbols actually look like and was what I expected upon download. But overall very killer faces bro and keep up the good work. Also dropping 5 stars on Flash!",

Maybe instead of using the same response to everyone that complains that it is not working with android wear 2 you might consider that you need to fix something.

That being said, it makes the watch a little laggy from time to time, the battery status of your phone doesn't always work or stay updated, and the automatic switch from Day to Night face doesn't work for me. Everything considered though, it is a pretty decent watch face. I'm using a Huawei watch with a Samsung S7 phone.",

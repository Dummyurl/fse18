Another developer helped me to to not only fix their, but their solution helped me to fix Photo Shop Pro. This is a good app, but support stinks. Therefore 4 stars instead of 5.  I chalk this off to a poor understanding of culture and  angery frustration due to the developer's inability to communicate.",

Some photos require cropping before they will look good on my watch, so it would be nice if they could be cropped right from within the app.    A number of stock images are displayed for me to choose from and some of these are really nice. But it would be great if after I choose my own image, it is added under the list of stock images or in a separate tab. This would make it easy to go back to a previously chosen photo. In  order to save space, it would be fine to just store a low resolution version of the image and then when I re-select a previously chosen watch face the watch could re-load the image from my mobile phone.",

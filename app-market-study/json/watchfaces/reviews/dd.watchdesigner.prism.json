        "comment": "I like the principle behind the watch face but on my G Watch it shows up with very narrow boxes around the numerals and some of the lines of the numbers themselves don't resolve very well. The animation sweeps in a circle which takes away from the angularity of the numerals. It would be cool if the ambient mode was black and white but looked like the prism.",

        "comment": "The watch face seem great from the photos, but the face itself on my moto 360 2 does not reflect those Screenshots. The fields housing the digital numbers on the display are artifacted and show as a thin, oddly-shaped box around the numbers. Additionally, the transition from time to date is very jarring. Will download again if it's fixed on the 360 2.",

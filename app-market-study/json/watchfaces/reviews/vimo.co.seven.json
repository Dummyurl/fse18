I'd love to see some improvements in the interface and perhaps the ability to track heart rate via bluetooth strap or something. The physical metrics are cool but it's but easier to evaluate recovery time by judging how quickly your heart recovers between sets. I'm not sure but it would also be nice to have a web app for this also.",

Many times the watch and the phone are not sync. The logged excercises on the watch are not stored on the phone, the new excercises are not present in the list of excercises. There are no statistics, only a log of the exercises and reps (poor formatted). Creating a workout is not easy, you cannot pick the excercises from a list. The home page of the app is useless. This app couls be a top commercial app, but at least on android it needs to be improved a lot.",

When I go to create a new workout or change the reps/weight on an existing workout, the app closes. I believe it still logs the workout, but the crash is annoying. Fix this, and it'll go back to 5 stars",

Crashes here and there. On wear 2.0 even every time you try to edit detected workout details like number of repetitions or weight used and log them. App simply crashes and edits are not saved. Thus, generally it is unusable now until this issue is solved. Yes, and the phone part of app is far from being good, too.",

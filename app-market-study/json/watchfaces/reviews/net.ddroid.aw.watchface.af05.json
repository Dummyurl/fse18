Then lastly, include a color pallet so we can change that green color to whatever we want. This app would be great with some of those tweaks implemented.",

(used the fixes location setting...set to NYC and Chicago, IL..Both failed to produce weather and windspeed).  I have the LG Urbane (with HTC one m8) and tried this version as well as the motor 360 version. Both versions have the same problem.  If this can be fixed, I would gladly buy and rate 5 Stars, but for now uninstalled for refund. Please FIX",

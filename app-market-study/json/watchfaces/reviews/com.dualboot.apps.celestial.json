Both normal and ambient look great, and the ambient-to-normal animation is eye catching. Only minor issue: On the Huawei, the normal-to-ambient transition doesn't always work in always-on mode (eg it will go black for several minutes or stay in a dimmed version of normal).",

I don't like the ambient mode to much only because i can't choose the color. Still worth the buy.  Edit. Uses way to much battery. 10 percent in 45 minutes?. What I experienced with the watch was nice. Not for me pretty though. Excellent customer service",

Our app should be around 2% or less. We hope this helps!  -DB",

There can be many reasons why your battery drain fluctuates due to usage, activity,etc. Sometimes rebooting your watch flushes any background apps that could be killing your battery as well.  Thanks! -DB",

        "comment": "ATTENTION DEVS!  I was initially very excited about this face, and the possibility of  featuring my lovely girlfriend on my LG G watch.  Unfortunately a couple of aspects of the watch face were cheesy and off-putting, so I would like to make these suggestions to the devs:  1. Do away with the shimmering white edge on the square watch face. It looks like pixels are broken, and that edge grabs my attention every time I turn the watch on.  It also makes a harsh border that keeps the watch face from visually blending into the bezel.  2. Do away with the wavy 3d effect (or allow the user to turn it off) of the watch face.  3. Allow the user to choose the option of inserting a photo into the \"standard\" watch face.  The secondary \"engraved\" watch face looks like poo, and is difficult to tell time on.  4. Allowing the option of inserting a small digital clock or battery meter into the top of the watch would be handy (handy...watch joke, get it?).  I refer to my watch so many times a day, reading an analog face is a bit slow.  I eagerly await a slightly improved version, and will definitely rebuy it!  If a dev replies as having seen this review I'll change the review to 5 stars.",

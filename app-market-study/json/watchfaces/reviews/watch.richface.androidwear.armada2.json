        "comment": "I've been using the Dynamic Watch Face as my Daily Driver for a while now however it appears to be having issues with things like weather updates and the face has not been updated since May (problems started well before that).  This is by the same developer but seems to be getting more attention since it was just updated last month.  I will probably end up making it my new daily driver.  I like it because it offers a good amount of data without really crowding the screen and the interaction options seem to work really well.  One thing I would like to see though is the ability to change the hand style as there is in the Dynamic Watch Face, I prefer slimmer more pointed hands to the thick blocky ones.  It would also be nice if there was a way to remove the hands completely when going into minimal ambient mode, again the same way the Dynamic Watch Face does.",

        "comment": "It only took a few days to get bored of it, as in the facts kept repeating. Some of the facts are pretty cheap too, example: \"1 is the number of moons around earth.\" C'mon, really? That's not paid app worthy... It could be something more fun like \"1 is the record number of minutes someone solved a 100 piece jigsaw puzzle\" or something... You can do better :-)",

Yes, we going to release more facts in the future, but it is going take a bit of time to find all the facts/backgrounds (some numbers are really hard to find) and to adapt the app to a larger database. We will keep you updated. Thanks for the review!",

        "comment": "Fun and cheap watch face. I've been using it for a day, and because I keep my display always on, and the watchface changes every minute, I was afraid it would burn through the battery. This was not the case at all.   One criticism I have is that on a flat tire screen like the Moto 360, some of the last words on longer pieces of trivia can get clipped. I wonder if this could be fixed by allowing us to change font size, or by shifting up the text.  In general it would be nice if the face was a little more customizeable. As of now, the two things that you can configure are (1) 12 vs 24 hr display, and (2) including the watch battery by the date.  Otherwise, this is a pretty cool and different watch face. I hope that the dev's keep adding more trivia and keep up their good work.",

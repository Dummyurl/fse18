        "comment": "there's room for improvement and more features. for example some more coding recipes would help newbies get going with their own design ideas. also making it easier to build your own watchface would be a good road to go. I enjoy the layers type of tools available but some copy pasting between your own designs wouldn't hurt. also making sure that the steps counter shows the same values as Google Fit would create less confusion regarding the sensors accuracy... these are the reasons why I give it 4*... for now",

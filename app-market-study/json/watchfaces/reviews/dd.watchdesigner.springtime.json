I really like it though, it's pretty and simple and what I wanted so it made me sad to return it. UPDATED 6/10/15, they let me know that the time format has been updated so I checked it out and it works perfectly now, switches between time formats right away, so I'm happy and changed my rating to 5 stars :)",

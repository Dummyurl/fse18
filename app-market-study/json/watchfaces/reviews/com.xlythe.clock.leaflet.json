Ambient mode could use a little tweaking as letters and icons are left transparently on the face and takes away from the elegant design. No notifications on ambient mode might be nice, Im sure the developers will decide the best way to deal with ambient mode. Overall this watch face is very impressive. Worth the money in my opinion.",

        "comment": "Like the watch face.  Lots of information in one place and it's easy to read.  However, the altimeter is WAY off.  The watch face altimeter says 1661 ft and my actual altitude is 1052 ft according to two different Android altitude apps and two location based web site altitude finders. Fix the altimeter and I will give 5 stars.  And yes, GPS location is enabled on my phone and in the watch face settings. UPDATE: I am sitting in the exact same location that I was when I wrote my first review.  The watch now says 1291 feet. That's a difference of 370 feet. The other ways I verified my altitude still show 1052 feet.",

        "comment": "This is my most favourite watch face. It is very tricky to install, it goes like this: Uninstall the V08 watch face from the playstore on my phone, go to the Android wear app, and click the lower \"MORE\" button to search and install more APPS from the playstore (rather than Watch Faces). There you search V08 watch face as if it were an app and install it. The smartwatch then instantly notices that you have a new app and asks if you want to install it. After installing it on the watch it still will not appear in the watch face list, but you can run the V08 app on your watch and one and one of this app's features is to set the V08 as my watch face.",

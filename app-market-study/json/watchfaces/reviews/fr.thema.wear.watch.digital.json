I use the  watch face to show the watch battery, digital time in 12 hour mode, the date and day, the step count and the weather. I have the watch set up pretty much the way its shown on this page. I set the circles so if I click on the step count circle it will auto pull up google fit on my watch and show me the exact step count. If I click on the weather circle it goes to google weather perfectly. I do not use google fit on my phone since its already on my watch and this watchface connects to it nicely. There is a delay on presenting the exact step count on the circle, but no problem I can click the circle and get the exact step count. Very Nice!",

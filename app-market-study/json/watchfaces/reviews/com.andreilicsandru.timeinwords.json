Problems im experiencing right now: opening calender (left) crashes the face. And the weather (right) resets the location and will not hold a set location! Again, happy the dev is constantly looking to better the face and im sure it will be fixed soon!",

For those with the calendar problem, you have an app that is drawing over the apps (wear mini launcher for example). Disable it set the permissions for the watch face and then reinstall / enable the other app. This is a bug I think from the OS. It happens on other apps as well.",

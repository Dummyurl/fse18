        "comment": "Was very excited to find the updated version. I had the old version but it never aligned correctly on my Huawei watch. This version looks great. The only request I have is could you make it so you can't change the color scheme when tapping the watch, but can still use the other interactive functions? With it on I always change my watch face color which is annoying. Unfortunately if I turn it off I can't access anything on the watch. I think the option to select the color scheme should be a totally separate on and off option from the other interactive functions. Thanks and keep up the great work.",

        "comment": "Like the watch face itself, lots of data and easy to read, weather interactive works really well.  However the options around the face (Stopwatch, Timer, Agenda, Menu) seem to be hit and miss, trying to get them to work can sometimes take a dozen or more touches.  I'm using the Moto 360G2 so I'm not sure if it is the watch but very frustrating, especially the Menu Option.  Also although the app provides the ability to change the colours of the ambient mode it does not appear to work, not matter what I set the ambient mode stays as white text on black background.  There is no date in ambient mode which really should be a standard feature.  Lastly the constant ads still popping up after paying for premium are extremely annoying.  I appreciate that paying for premium unlocks the features but it should remove the adds as well especially since you sometimes have to go through 2 or 3 of them to get into the app.  Thankfully once the face is setup I won't have to access the app very often so I can deal with it.",

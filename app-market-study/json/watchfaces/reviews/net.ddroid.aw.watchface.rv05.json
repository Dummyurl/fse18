I'd like to be able to change colors or have themes plus be able to do things like remove the digital temperature and analog 24hour clock to reduce redundancy and make everything in the center a bit bigger. However I bought this knowing it did none of this, so even if you released a different one I'd buy it.",

It shows 100% all the time.",

        "comment": "Last update seems to have completly broken the watch face, the companion app reloads everytime I leave it, never saves settings (even if I manually save a profile) and does not show up in the android wear app, or on my watch.  Unusable until fixed.  Also the menu for the watchface settings on the phone looks pretty janky, and has minimal feedback when you do various actions, such as no notifications for when you save/load a profile, change weather settings, and a slew of other things dont have any feedback as to whether or not it worked.  Edit: i dont have play store on ny smart watch.  After restarting my phone and watch multiple times and reinstalling the app on and off my phone 3 times, o got master to load again, and the settings seem to save now.  Upped to a 3 star review, which I'll change to 5 once the app itself gets a bit more polish and options and changes in app have some form of solid confirmation when doing things  Aside from that, I do really like how this app runs and looks",

Please go in the Google Play store on your watch and search for the watch face by swipping down the screen. Install it and everything should be solved",

This event was added through an online link, so I dont know if that is why it wasn't shown on the watch screen or if it was because it was in my calendar before I installed this watch face. I will have to figure that out in a couple of days. I did add some test events however and those did show up on my watch face.",

Also, be able to show the date in ambient mode would be great. Maybe even show the text in the calendar events also in ambient mode. And a stopwatch feature. Than it would be perfect .",

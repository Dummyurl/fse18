Wish widget were 4x1 and more tweekable but, good enough. Fir example, shrink the time a bit. I like that it shows as much info as it does; I'd be willing to loose some of it for a smaller widget. Also like that the widget touch area is sensitive such that tap on clock area brings up clock and two on weather area bring up whether.",

Ability to see both hourly & weekly forecasts is nice, but I wanted that capability for the widgets, not in the app. (You have to select hourly OR weekly forecast in the widget settings menu). Provides a temperature notification icon permanently at the top of screen (very convenient at a quick glance). I love the widget background/transparency options.",

It also has a leading zero which is even sillier if you're not going to have a 24-hour.  That is even if you use a larger Widgets or on the app itself.

The only thing is that you have to choose between hourly weather and few days forecast through menu, but this is not really a problem.",

Only reason it got two stars is because of how well this app functions. Hopefully they get rid of ads like that or offer an ad free version. Otherwise I will be finding a new one soon.",

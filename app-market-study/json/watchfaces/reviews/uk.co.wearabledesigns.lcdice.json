        "comment": "Just bought it. Looks great, but on Android Wear app on phone it says ERROR & keeps crashing. On the watch, I can't get the weather icon or updates on screen, so all I have it's the steps widget. Some other tech probs too, such as not all colour changes take place or even add the widget. Not really happy. Only this watch face from this Dev is problematic. Please fix these probs devs. (LG Urban 1st Gen with OS 2.0)",

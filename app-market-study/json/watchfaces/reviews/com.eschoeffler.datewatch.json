        "comment": "BEST.  CALENDAR. WATCH FACE.  EVER!  I have tried and dropped 7 or 8 different calendar watch faces. My life planning depends on seeing my appointments on my watch face.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  I uninstalled Microsoft Outlook to go with this. Outlook was buggy, sometimes didn't show my events, and took way too long to load events onto the watch face.  This app is smooth and immediate.  Dev: I would gladly pay for the ability to change colors, especially to assign colors to different calendars.  But not if it makes the app buggy.  The smooth simplicity of this is what I love about it.  Very, very, VERY well done!",

All the other stuff isn't needed all the time and just wastes battery and causes more burn in. Also needs the option to tap the weather widget and get more detailed information instead of cycling. Please consider adding these features, especially the minimal always on mode.",

Really love the phone and watch battery monitors on the sides.  It also seems to be really easy on the battery.  I take my watch off the charger at 7am (weekdays) and usually around 5pm I'm at about 50% battery on a \"normal use\" day.  I've noticed that using this face I'm around 60-65+% battery at that time of day.",

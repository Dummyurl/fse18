Would love it if you added ability to:  - change size (time and date independently)  - change font independently for date and time  - change text color independently for date and time(sometimes the image requires separate colors)  - select date format 'July 7' without the the day.   And for a stretch, not sure if it's feasible, but sending multiple watch faces to watch so that you could switch between them at will.  If this isn't possible, would be nice to save them on phone and resend saved ones at will.",

It would stay on one minute for too long then quickzily pass the next one to the proper time.                Edit: apparently it's my watch skipping minutes as I caught it doing on another fac",

Also the \"Press Start 2P\" 8-bit font is cool. Only which there was an option for custom text color so I can make the font green. Still worth a 5/5 though.",

With the ability to move the clock and date position, or to remove the data altogether would be nice to see as well as perhaps a way to show up cards as their smaller form? Not sure how/if that could be done.   Easily the best way to make a watch face right now - perhaps the ONLY way for end users!",

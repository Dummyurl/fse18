        "comment": "I kinda like it. Wished it looked a little more refined. A little too cartoony looking. The main reason for the 2 star rating is that when the screen of the moto 360 turns on, only the back dial and numbers appear at first and all the other dials and details appear about a second after the screen is on. Kind of annoying. I hope this gets fixed in the future so I could give this app another try. Until then I'll be getting a refund. Sorry.",

I love how there is a little digital clock and date that tells you the time like a SMART watch should. -1 because it takes a little while to fully turn on upon unlocking like almost all other non OEM faces.",

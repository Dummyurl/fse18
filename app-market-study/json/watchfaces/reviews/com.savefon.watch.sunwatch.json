Maybe add time of solar noon? For a while I thought the shadow was reversed, if you point 12  noon North, the shadow is correctly oriented.",

        "comment": "Interesting view. Like the sunrise and sunset: bigger font than on F04 watch face. BUT...  the black font color of the sunrise/set times is unreadable on the dark blue background of the nighttime face. The color of the sunrise/set font should also switch at night, like the color of the time. I've only had the face for a day, so I don't recall if the date was also in an unreadable font color; if so, the same applies to that.",

We have updated our app and now the font of the sunrise/sunset time changes its color at night exactly like the colors of the date and time. Now the sunrise/sunset become fully readable at anytime. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy the new look.",

I restarted both my watch and my phone, but still I see no option or ability to change pictures. Even adding new ones won't help. Once this is resolved, I'll give 5 stars. I have a Wear24 watch. Edit: I figured out how to change pictures from the watch. Still difficult, it's best to just keep my favorite picture in the middle slot. Now going with 4 stars. I'll rate it 5 IF it was super simple to switch pictures from the phone by tapping and choosing \"apply\" like with the Samsung Gear S3.",

Please consider adding the settings configuration to the watch itself. Depending on the photo sometimes I want a different placement of the time, and as it is currently I have to change that on my phone. Could also allow for saving a specific display setting for each photo ahead of time. A small gripe but still my daily driver!",

        "comment": "I was looking for an app which would navigate me along a recorded/downloaded track with Wear support. Most apps with wear support were not able to strictly follow the waypoints in a satisfying manner. This app though fulfills my use case 100%. After 4h of navigation I still had about 60% left on my Huawei Watch so a full day should not be a problem. App is simple to use with a lot of thought put into it on what functionality and information is useful when navigating. Fantastic work by the developer!",

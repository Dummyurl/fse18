Maybe this has to do with having a square watch (SW3) and being used to the face I have had for the past 18 months. I'll happily recommend it from a functionality point of view and it installed and operates 100%..... but the pics on the Android Authority review made it look very different from my reality. Still, it wasn't a heap of money and I hope the developer puts it to good use",

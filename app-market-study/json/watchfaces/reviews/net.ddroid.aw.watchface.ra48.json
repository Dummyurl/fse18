(Google fit is inaccurate)  Every thing works including the heart rate but the screen is way too busy for me. Now the negatives:  There is so much on the watch face that everything is micro size. Major battery drain! I have since switched to the Everyday watchface by HuskyDEV. Which is the best watch face I own because it has a builtin launcher and more!",

Why does this not work picking up my home WiFi when the phone is off.... Can't get future Temps or forecast. Just walked 30 minutes it says I walked 16.walked 1.45 miles says I took 500 steps. REAL? Sorry I bought it . update doesn't count steps",

The one issue is the pedometer\u2026   it is counting less than half the steps that Fit app has for the day,  and the watch has been on my arm all day,  the phone not so much..   Fix that and I am revising my review to 5 stars",

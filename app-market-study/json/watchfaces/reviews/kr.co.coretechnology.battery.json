Used the same picture on the default wear 'custom' face and it shows up crystal clear. Hoping this can be improved with an update. Also having the ability to change the background with a gradient would be nice too.",

If I have to pay 99 cent to change the colors then I would like a \"save color profile\" option. Then I could easily change from 1 preset to the other. 2. If I want the time, date, and stroke to be the exact same color, it's rather difficult to do so. It would be nice to have a \"recently used\" color option. If these issues are addressed I would gladly rate the app at 5 stars",

There's an in-app purchase option for Premium but this is in fact a donation and the free version is the same as the Premium. I've donated anyway because it's a good well-designed app.  The only extra feature I'd like is the ability to change the font size of the time and date...especially the date. Some of us don't have 20-20 vision.",

Not quite as good as Chrono watch face, but it's a very close second. I'll be using this as my primary watch face for the coming weeks. Using the Sony SmartWatch 3 and still looks excellent. One quick question I have: Is there a way to display the watch battery percentage and phone battery percentage on the face? I had a quick look through the settings earlier and couldn't see anything.",

Updated to the premium version,  but fear that the additional colours will kill the battery faster? Worth paying for the update even if it's just as a thanks to the programmer.",

I would like to be able to control the sleep mode display a little better..  Personally i would prefer the all the elements to drop down to a darkish grey but it would be even better if we could set the colours for sleep mode in the same way you set the colours when viewing it.",

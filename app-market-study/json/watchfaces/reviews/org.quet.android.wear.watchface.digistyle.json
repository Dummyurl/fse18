I was always changing the watch face via the Android Wear app on my phone, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get to the settings.  There is only the most very brief split-second look at it in the video -- I actually had to rewind it and put it on pause to see that it was in the \"choose watch face\" control.  So, one sentence, could you please add that to your description?  It would save all kinds of time and aggravation!",

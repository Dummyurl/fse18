        "comment": "I really love this watch face. It's informative, fun to look at, and very configurable (battery on my LG G Watch is not abused by it thanks to some clearly defined config settings).  My only complaint is that the step counter does not appear to be tied to Google Fit, but rather, is it's own independent thing. I went for a walk with the dog for over an hour and took nearly 10k steps by the watch face's count, but Google Fit did not show the same count at all (substantially less), which means that the watch and phone were not using the same pedometer API.  Other than that, it's still a great watch face and I'll be keeping it :)  EDIT: User error! The watch pedometer is using Google Fit when available! I had to refresh the Google Fit App and web page in order for the steps to match up. Step for step they are the same, so yes, this watch face gets zero complaints from me :)",

Only one complaint: I have a very hard time activating the interactive features.  The Fitness stats activate easily, but the battery stats are hard to open, and the weather information  (which I believe is vital) is almost impossible to access. Fix that, and I  update my rating to 5 stars. Otherwise, thanks for a good looking watch face!",

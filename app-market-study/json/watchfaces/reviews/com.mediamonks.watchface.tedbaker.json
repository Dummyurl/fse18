        "comment": "Update: This app works now. I still want the option to add widgets, but it's as beautiful as ever.  Currently IMO, Ted Baker has most beautiful faces available for Android Wear. I love them. I wish there were a way to add a couple of discreet widgets. Also, I'm not sure why they're separated into male/female categories.... For the most part, the faces are gender neutral.   Unfortunately, after the latest update, this app shuts down on launch. For reference, I have a brand new Zenwatch 2. Will update my review when it works.",

My only problem with this app is that when I go into the settings, I can't figure out how to select \"male\" vs \"female\". I think I've finally figured it out, but it is not at all intuitive, and it's not very responsive so it takes a while to actually get into the watch faces to see if I had done it right. I would love to see more watch face options - but only because they are beautiful and I love staring at them! :)",

Most of the images actually look nice as a watch face (which is oddly rare), and the way the hands sweep/reveal from one image to another is neat.  Some feedback:  I do wish that it would provide the option for showing subtle hour tick marks around the edge. I can manage to tell the time but it's not the super-easy at-a-glance process you really want from a watch.  (And a minor thing: it would also be nice if, when you tap the face to flip the two images, it remembered that flipped state after dimming and waking up again.)",

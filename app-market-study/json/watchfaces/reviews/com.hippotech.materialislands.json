For instance, I like the volcano with big ash cloud instead of small one, and the original sun (the new one just doesn't feel right to me, idk why...). To understand how big this is, let me say that you that you're tampering with somebody's wallpaper. If you're going to release an update that does that, even minor changes, give the option to switch between new and old. Maybe the new versions of the other islands look better than the others, it depends on the user looking at them. Nevertheless they are still great, as always.   Btw, on your donations section of the support tab, not even if you go to Burger King, 99\u00a2+tax is NOT buying you a coffee, you might need a buck 50. Hehe. Donors beware of this tax, idk if that's the app or Google but it charges $1.03.",

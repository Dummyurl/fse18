But I wish I could turn off modules, or at least change the date format and turn off the labels - they're kind of dorky (\"atomic\").  It doesn't look as smooth as stock faces in ambient mode, but pretty good, which is what I see most because I use 'always on'. I would like this more if the 4 lines that remain across the screen went away in ambient mode.",

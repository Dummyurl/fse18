I paid in hopes full ambient mode was a paid app option but at least on LG Watch Urbane it is not available. The upset is that because it is an in-app purchase, I can't get a refund. See I use all my watchfaces in full ambient otherwise it beats the purpose for me. I recommend Weareal watchface as a great alternative for that.",

I love skeleton watches and have been on the lookout for a watch face that has skeleton features, and actually looks good. This is the first! The option to remove the tourbillon is nice as well (not that I ever would!)  One thing I would like added if possible is a setting which allows adjustment of the outside golden rim. On the Moto360 it kind of looks like there are two rims with this watch face, so a setting which could make it smaller, or even remove it entirely would be an awesome addition.",

However, the dimmed mode is the black and white mode like other watch faces,not the elegant dim gold background that was there before the update. Please revert..

The \"OK Google in center\" and \"Compass\" check boxes don't have any effect on the display. I don't care about the OK Google since I don't want it cluttering up the display anyway, but the ability to disable the compass would be cool since I don't use it. If it worked and used the extra space to make the face slightly bigger, that would be awesome. Too bad it doesn't do anything.",

        "comment": "This is a nice face, but I have 2 issues with it. First, the compass doesn't work. What is it supposed to do? Should the dial rotate about the face as I turn, or should there be a ticker that moves about the dial? I don't know. Mine does nothing when I turn the compass on. The other issue is that only 1 background gives you the option of turning on the digits around the clock face. I want to see the numbers, so now I only have one usable background. The digits should be a separate setting. Fix for 5 stars.",

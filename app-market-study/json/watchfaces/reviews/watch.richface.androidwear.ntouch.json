One thing disappointed me with this watch face and hence the 3 star rating is the steps counter. It doesn't work or I have to connect my phone to the watch. Most other faces have the ability to use the watch step counter so you don't need to carry the phone or have Google fit connected by Bluetooth. Until this is fixed/added then I will give this 5 stars.",

        "comment": "Managed to get watch face to show in Google Store on my watch - KG Urban - but unable to get it to show as a selectable watch face on my watch. I have purchased the premium version but to date it is unusable.  Update. Received response to my original rant above and advised to load from Google Playstore on the watch. I had already tried this but thought I'd give it another go... Surprise, phone face was sitting in my watch face selection.  Pleased with my purchase. Give your watch time to find and recognise new face.",

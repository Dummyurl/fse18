Also, it's taking a very long time for them to fix the coming soon no connection issue. So at the moment, not only are you stuck with a limited number of watch faces to choose from, but there are zero new ones coming in. It's been like this for nearly a month. This app could well be one of the better ones, but still lacks in a lot of areas.",

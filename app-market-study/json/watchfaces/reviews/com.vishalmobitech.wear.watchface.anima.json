        "comment": "Using my Huawei watch the concept looks great, more interesting than just a traditional watchface on a digital device. Yet, my widgets never seem to work. When I get them to work then they only do so for a short period of time. I'll update some settings and then when I look later, they have reset themselves. I paid for pro and would give 5 stars if everything didn't glitch out on me. I would love an update that fixes the issues, if there isn't one coming then I feel I wasted the money to buy pro version.",

        "comment": "I paid for the Pro Package and I like the app but many things are not working.  Quite a few widgets just don't work (step counter is wrong, OK Google doesn't work in any location, some widgets don't go away in ambient mode without any logical reason, Google Keep doesn't connect to the app, etc.).   I am using a new Huawei Watch 1.  Please correct these problems.  It's a great concept and an interesting visual display.  If everything worked it would be worth the money.  As it is, I will need a refund from the Play Store if these things can't be fixed.",

I charged my watch around 20 hours ago while using this face and still have 59% left now! I was a bit worried at first that the battery life would be negatively affected but clearly not an issue.  Looking forward to future updates :)",

Only issue that is very minor is that ever time I take my Moto 360 out of the charger, the options for the watchface screen comes up and I have to press the button to close it. Besides this, I highly recommend this",

But no one reply me.. And just a few days ago, as I was looking for a new watch faces, I bumped into this perfect watch face.. Quickly I registered my card and buy this watch face app. Thank you..",

Would be great if it has more features such as Steps counter, calories and weather... And maybe an option to hide the watch icon from the App Drawer. But I am still using it as I simply love the design!",

It's almost there but the image doesn't seem to be sharp enough. The dullness actually makes it a little hard to tell the time, every time my watch lights up I actually strain my eyes a little trying to figure it out. I know it must be difficult with all the black, but the watch could benefit from some sort of shadow, make the hands a little more 3D",

Does the compass scale appear and is not moving or the compass mode is not selectable in the settings?\nPS Just tested it on Moto360, it works.

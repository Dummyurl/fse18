The biggest issue is that when a card is showing up, and its between 4 and 8 o'clock the card covers up the time. Why not also have the time show up in the center? Also, on a round screen the battery indicators are off-screen completely, and the watch face as a whole just feels... a little over sized compared to the device.  There needs to be more padding around the face (this would also help fix the off-screen battery indicators). Finally, and this is just a minor thing, I really feel like the typography of the watchface could be improved to be more usable at a glance.  The idea behind this watchface is phenomenal, but the execution is lacking. I look forward to coming back to this the next time it is updated.",

I love the typography and the way it looks in ambient mode, If you could make it so that instead of reverting to an analogue version, it just has digital time displayed using the same style as the regular text on this watch face, I'd gladly give it a 5 star rating!",

I actually really like the simple, elegant face that displays when there's nothing imminent. The Ustwo designers really understood how to take advantage of Android Wear to create something that shows a view of time, in a beautiful, intuitive, glanceable way, and is also novel and couldn't have been done mechanically. Kudos.",

Please make sure your Android Wear app and Google Play Services is up to date. If this does not resolve the issue, please hit us up at wearissues@ustwo.com!\n\nBest,\nustwo Wear Team",

And it doesn't provide a way to get to the agenda app for more info (either on watch or phone). Minor gripes, but very nice for what it does.",

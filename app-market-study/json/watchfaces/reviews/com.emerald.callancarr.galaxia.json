        "comment": "Really nothing amazing here. The watchface looks good but in the description it is implied there is a bunch of customization but really all you can do is change the background. There is no date option. I also find it hard to believe that this watchface is \"optimized\" to magically give you better battery life. Also seems there hasn't been an update in over a month which makes me a little nervous these basic features will not come.",

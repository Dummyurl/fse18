Just improve the search - it does not search keywords within 'my meals' and 'recent' items on app do not sync with 'frequently used'  on Web version. Sometimes you lose  saved items - does it say 'saved changes' too soon?",

My only problem is the barcode scanner. I not surprised it doesn't work for me since I'm in Iceland. It makes sense that the app doesn't have a lot of the stuff available here as I'm sure there aren't a lot of users from Iceland, but so far I've only been able to use the scanner once. I expected the app to at least have some of the imported stuff.",

There's a fair amount of options and features for the app, I personally enjoy the ability to choose what time of plan you'd like to do for whatever you're trying to achieve. One issue I've come across that's really annoying is when using the add food feature. It closes out and refreshes what you were writing if you minimize the app. Which is really frustrating when you're trying to copy nutrition from online into the app. If they could fix that issue this app would be worth 5 stars to me.",

Overall a great app. Some potential added things could be a step or distance counter. One thing I noticed that is a bit concerning is that my battery drained by 50% in 4 hours using the dimmed 1 second update mode on my Sony Smartwatch 3. That's quite a lot. My score is 4.5+ out of 5. Great job.",

Love the fact it is easy to stop and restart time. The reminder is also great that clock is stooped. Vibrate alert. Count up or down timer - screen shows both so you can pick mode you are used to. If you are a referee (or umpire) do yourself a favor and use this app. The watches will see so antiquated!!! I see myself using this for other sports too.",

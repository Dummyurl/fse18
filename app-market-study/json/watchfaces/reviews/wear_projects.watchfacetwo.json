Hoping to see more customization options in the future, specifically choosing what info displays on the bottom and what order to cycle it through. Also an option to remove the shadow on ambient so that the entire number shows up.",

Have noticed a bug though -  if you turn the minutes markers off, when the face is active, you can only see the seconds in the space after the minute hand before 0 degrees. So, if it's late in the hour, you can only see the seconds tick for a few seconds before they vanish behind a background again for the rest of the minute. Suspect it's a layer thing... Some more colour choices would be nice, too... Or a colour wheel?",

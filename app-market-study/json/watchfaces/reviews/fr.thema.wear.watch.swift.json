If you've paid for Premium it should remove the \"Obtain Premium Access\" option from the menu on the watch completely. It must go away. 2. For some reason the weather widget on the watch won't show the temp, it just draws 2 dashes, even if I set the weather location manually and disable GPS. Other than that, outstanding app.",

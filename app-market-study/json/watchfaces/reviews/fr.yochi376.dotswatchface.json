Only two issues: 1) Can't assign in built apps (such as torch or timer) to triple tap. 2) Transition animations are slow, often activating right when I wake up my watch, making me wait before I can see the time. Would be nice if I could disable those.",

Both restarting the phone and the watch don't seem to fix it. If you fix this, I will quickly change my rating to 5 stars.",

Edit: Anthony, I used it once to see what it looked like and I didn't like it. After not thinking about it again your app decided to notify me LOUDLY while I was in a meeting to remind me to buy it. First, you don't know if I'm using it, secondly, \"reminding\" someone to buy something that you offer for free is a pretty dick move. Maybe if you want to sell it don't give it out for free? I'm pretty sure if i wanted the extra functionality I would have paid by now. It's even fine if you advertise that you can upgrade on the watch face...but notifications?!? unprofessional.",

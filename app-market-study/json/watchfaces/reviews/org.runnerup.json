But the recorded tracks appear as very jaggy lines with no detail whatsoever, you only get a very rough idea were you ran. This is a known issue to the developer and has been reported several times in the GitHub of RunnerUp. Until this is fixed, I simply cannot recommend this app. Which is a shame because RunnerUp has everything to become THE app for tracking runs. Except that the core functionality, recording runs, is broken. I would love to be able to use and RELY on RunnerUp.",

Running on mountain courses also seems to log far less than the actual distance, but that's probably a limitation of GPS, since phones don't come with altimeters to measure elevation changes.  So this is mostly useful as a stopwatch and workout tracker for time, not so useful for distance and pace.",

I was able to connect to RunnerUp to my RunKeeper, Endomondo, Runtastic, and Google Fit accounts, but the app crashed every time I tried logging in to my Strava account and constantly re-promted me for credentials when I tried tying it to my MapMyRun account. The UI isn't pretty, but it gets the job done.  I just wish there were a \"treadmill mode\" - a way to record activity without a GPS (which would allow heart rate capture), and then manually define the your Miles Traveled before saving (and publishing) your activity. There's a lot of promise here, it just doesn't quite deliver yet.  (For what it's worth, I'd absolutely be willing to pay for the app if it were a little more stable and if it worked with MapMyRun.)",

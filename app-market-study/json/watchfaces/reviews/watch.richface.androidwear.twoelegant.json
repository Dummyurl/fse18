In response to the Developer, yes, I did try to change the colors via the app. Got it to work sometimes. The text colors are the ones giving me the problems. Making changes to  the watch is not very responsive. As for the \"steps\"....yes, I'm connected to FIT. I show the left indicator on the app but the watch still shows Watch and phone indications. For some reason it won't change.   If we can get this to work, I'll change my star rating. I do like this watch face.",

When you choose to display the date it displays the day of the week and the full name of the month. It does not display the date.   followup:  If I use the right complication and not the top I can get a month date display. I would prefer it on top, but it is not enough of an issue to keep this from being my go to watch face.",

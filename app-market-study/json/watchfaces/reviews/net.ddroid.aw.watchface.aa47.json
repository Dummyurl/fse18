Everything including temperature, humidity, it's very easy to tell what your battery level is in the phone and on the watch. I was a bit disappointed when clouds showed up on my watch but it was a clear sky. Somehow that changed and now it's correct. It does suck up some battery,  Outstanding!  Ok one small con. Uses 9% battery while idle. I have to charge daily instead of every two days",

Would be better if you could turn them off, hide them out at least turn them black and white. Also, there is not a step counter on the face, which is a pretty basic complication. That just boggles my mind.",

        "comment": "Nice face design, but the app is NOT very user friendly. It took me a while to work out I had to install the app on both my watch AND my phone to be able to customize anything. Then, the controls in the app are not self-explanatory - tool tips explaining each function would be helpful. Alternatively, a \"dummy\" watch face in the app could show the effect of changing a setting. It took ages for the settings I changed to sync to my watch, so much so that I couldn't work out what any of the functions did, because I had no visual feedback on what each change did. Also a bit disappointed that I can't view today's step count in one of the icon slots, only an icon that once you press it gives you the week's stats.",

It looks nice, it's functional and it seems to have less impact on my battery life and watch responsiveness than any other watch face I've tried.  My only issues are, I can't seem to disable the background design in Pro. I just want it to have a black background. And I'd love the ability to have an AMOLED friendly full ambient mode (ie all black background and maybe no color in the shortcut icons).  Other than that I love this one.",

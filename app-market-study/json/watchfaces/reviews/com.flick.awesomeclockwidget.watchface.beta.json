I can understand SOME in-app purchases, but this is ridiculous. I've purchased other apps for the same price they have way more free options available with the initial purchase. You need to be more open about what is included in the initial purchase: next to nothing. I won't be purchasing any other apps from this developer. Let the buyer beware.",

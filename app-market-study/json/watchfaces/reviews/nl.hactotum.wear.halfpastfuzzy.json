        "comment": "Fuzzy implementation needs work. I'm using the \"Fuzzier\" setting, and at 10:28 the watch was telling me \"Quarter past Ten\" despite it being much closer to half-past. Similarly, at 11:48 the watch is saying \"Noon\" even though 11:48 is closer to \"Quarter till noon\" than to \"Noon\". Other than this complaint, the watch face is excellent. Wonderful customization options, ability to change font, color, size and wording.",

Only issues are cards cover bottom string if it's of a reasonable size and no complications for date. Perhaps allow the display to resize or rearrange if a card is present.",

        "comment": "Nearly ten years ago, I learned of a project where someone was planning to create a watch which would tell the approximate time.  I thought it was a terrific idea and every so often, I'd check the project webpage to see if there was any progress and saw nothing (well, nothing meaningful).  A few months ago, I learned of a watch which merely shows the hour hand (and the noon mark on the face is where noon is supposed to be, straight up!).  I thought that was really cool, too, but couldn't justify spending a few hundred bucks on a watch that did nothing but tell the (approximate) time.  How incredibly lucky I am to live in a world where I have a smartwatch that lets me install a watchface that gives me either of the above two concepts (and thousands more).  Are there things I'd like to change about HPF?  Sure.  Are there other things in my life I'd like to change?  Sure.  But sometimes I need to be okay with things being the way they are.  Heck, if I wait a few minutes, they'll change.  :)   Thank you, Hactotum, for making this awesome face available to us for free.",

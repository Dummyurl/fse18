It needs an option to use the smaller card previews, otherwise it's a bit useless. I know the dev is responsive, so I hope they take this on board. EDIT: The lack of response from developer has forced me to change my review. Watch face is useless if cards cover the time.",

It would be nice to have the notifications be short cards instead of taking up a good chunk of the screen (e.g. music player when listening to music on my phone interferes with the time).

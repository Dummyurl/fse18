Click on the weather all and see the forecast. Click on the time - get a stop watch or alarm. The ambient like could use some work also. Maybe invert it. Just make it black n white. But this face is still awesome! Worth the cash...wait..I forgot if it's free or paid... Anyways, little thing's need work. Great face",

Also the full color ambient mode doesnt drain the battery on my LG Gwatch R like some other watch faces. I have one request though. Ambient mode is always the default orange color. I'd like the color in ambient mode to be the same color that is selected for active mode.",

I must admit I normaly use simpler faces. - I changed the background color, but everytime the face activates, the default color is briefly displayed before switching to the one I selected. Too bad the default is orange which shows a lot. - Passed the first few minutes, I was only interested by actual time which kind of gets lost in the bells and whistles.",

That space could probably be better used with a sunrise/sunset chart like is found on the F03 WatchFace.  Alternatively, put the battery percents and icons where the analog clock is and use the space at the bottom for the sunrise/sunset chart.  Also, where is the black and white mode for this face?  I would actually like to do colored text on a black background most of the time.  Note: I've seen a few app crashes if I switch away from this face and then switch back to it again but the face does come right back to this is more of an annoyance than a real problem.",

        "comment": "If you like beautifully designed skeleton watch faces with tons of movement, and highly configurable, then this is the face for you. What's more, you can actually adjust the time until the watch face dims, even up to 30 seconds. Amazing! You can keep the full design, with color  (but no movements)  visible in dim mode. The only downsides are that the watch is a little hard to read (like all skeletons) and it may use a little extra battery power.",

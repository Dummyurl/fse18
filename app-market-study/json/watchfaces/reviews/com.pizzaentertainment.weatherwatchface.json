Pretty disappointing. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing but still have the same issues. Will change 1 star rating when app starts working how it's supposed to again.",

I like the watchface but am very preturbed the weather problem is still an issue.",

It also provides battery meters for both the watch and the phone. Unfortunately, when the temperature exceeds 100F (which it does often here in Phoenix, AZ), the degrees symbol overlaps the watch icon. It's not a functional problem, but it does mess up the aesthetics of the face.",

Can the 'ok google' be removed from appearing on watch face ?  Update - 2nd time I tried this out the temp was out of whack.

What a waste of time. - Gave it another shot, more crashes and keeps losing watch face setting; but I forgot about the 12-hour update and wore wrong get up for the weather. HATE this even more now.",

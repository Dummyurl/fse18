Will uninstall for now but will try it again later. I have greatly loved this app, esp its ability to be set to hone in on tiny local climate areas! No other app is like this. Would be very happy to pay for special features if needed to make this work again as before in my obscure geographical area.",

Weather prediction that isn't close to reality is useless.  Odd because this phenomenon with the two included providers started happening about 6 weeks ago.  Perhaps it is time to look for a replacement weather app that uses good data sources.",

All in all I'd say it's a great app.",

But nothing beats this app for a \"Weather & Clock\" homepage widget. Ideal layout and appearance customizations couldn't be better. Especially appreciated is the calendar and clock sections of the widget can be configured to launch whatever calendar and clock apps you want. Can't even think of a small complaint (maybe more fonts?). Works beautifully with Nova Launcher too. Highly recommended.",

When using 24-hour time, it still says p.m. for the evenings except, it's morning. So, for example, right now it is 8:45 in the morning but, it says 08:45 pm. Firstly, in 24 hour time, it should not have a.m. or p.m. Second, it shows p.m. for the mornings. Like I said, a minor glitch that I'm sure can be fixed in a future update. Other than that, it's excellent. So much so, that I paid for the full version after installing and trying out and many others before this one. If you fix this minor glitch, I'll be sure to go back and give the full five stars and revise this review.  Update: Now, it shows PM all the time. I just noticed!

MONSTER SLOW EVEN WHEN MANUALLY UPDATED, IF IT WILL UPDATE AT ALL!  I HAVE THE PAID VERSION,  AND IT KEEPS TRYING TO BILL ME!  IT WAS SUCH A DELIGHT.  WORTHLESS TO ME NOW. SAD. WONDER WHAT HAPPENS DEVELOPERS QUIT CARING. OH WELL... HERE I GO AGAIN ...  I'VE USED THIS APP FOR SEVERAL YEARS. ONE OF THE VERY BEST EVER! I AM SO PROUD TO GIVE A REVIEW OF AN EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT!ACES IN MY BOOK!",

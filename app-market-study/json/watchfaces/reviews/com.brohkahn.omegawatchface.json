The only issue I have is that the step counter step up is all over the place. First it doesn't show anything, when it reads from Google Fit it doesn't read correctly, and reading from the watches sensors give me exacerbated readings. Other than that is really great!

I have the app installed on my phone but it won't seem to install on to my Asus Zenwatch 2. I have tried uninsalling the app, paid key and facotory seting the watch. I have also tried re synching apps in Android Wear and refreshing in the Omega Watch app. It does not list the face within the watch when pressing and holding down on the watch to try to change the face. I have had this watch face before on the watch when I used a Moto X, first generation. If you could please contact me at your convenience with any solutions on how to transfer your watch face from my new phone to the watch. Thank you and have a nice day! - Joe",

This watch brings back that warm fuzzy feeling and brings back fantasies about cutting through the floor with my watch laser (still wish I could do that... dang!).  Tip - if you're on Android Wear 2.0 and install this watch face on the watch itself, make sure you go back to your phone and install it there as well!  That's the only way that you'll be able to make customizations and ensure all data is synced with the watch.  Great job guys! The only problem I'm having at the moment is that the weather seems to get stuck after a while. When I pressed the refresh button in the app it synced, but not sure for how long. It was showing 59 degrees for a long time during these sunny Orange County days.",

I've just received the update that allows proper support for square watches. Although it's certainly appreciated, now that I've seen it for myself I'd much prefer a toggle that lets me keep the original round face on the watch, as the straight battery indicators spoil the classic look!  Any chance of implementing this option in your next update?",

I also find it annoying that if you uninstall and then reinstall either the phone app or the watch app, the settings reset on the reinstalled app, but doesn't sync up with the other app.  And there is no way to sync them after the reinstall.  I wouldn't mind if both apps reset, but I have to cycle the app setting for every setting I changed to get the watch back to how I had it before.  It's usually faster for me to just reinstall the other app then to cycle though all the settings.",

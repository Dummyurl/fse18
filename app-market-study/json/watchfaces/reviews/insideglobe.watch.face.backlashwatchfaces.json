I would love to have the capability to adjust digital clock (12/24hr Mode), and disable indicators (rather than just off), google fit integration (Not a fan of software running its own calculation on steps), adjust second hand to a firmer motion (rather than smooth, consuming more battery life), but I still love the look!. I am having a problem where the hands are in the background , the phone battery always shows low (even with 100% charge), and the color settings do not stay locked in upon waking, it keeps defaulting to tan.",

Maybe a bigger digital time in dim mode and no analog or take out the white/dark theme and make it either completely white or completely dark and opposite color hand of time but for the rest I like it a lot. Even better if you could change that but just in dim mode.",

Tried sending the dev a nicely worded email before negative rating only to find that there is no way to contact him. The email address he lists on his apps does not exist and his facebook page redirects to his Play Store apps page.  This app does 1 thing right, it brings a BTC ticker to android wear. There are very barebones minimum customization options, you as a user do not know and can not set the price refresh frequency or what exchange is used (I understand that this would be difficult to implement user settings for; at least let us know what they are if we can't change them...)  App is near unusable on H-Watch due to formatting issues.",

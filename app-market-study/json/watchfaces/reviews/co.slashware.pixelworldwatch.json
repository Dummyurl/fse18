With a sickening sense of deja vu, you begin to dream. You try to wake, but tonight the ghostly eyes captivate you.  \"Treachery and doom! \u00a0My brother would unleash a great evil upon us. Britannia is in peril!\"",

Of this could be fixed, this would be my default watch face. As it is now, I cannot use it because I am unable to glance at the time without using a hand which undoes the whole purpose of a watch. If this is changed I will redo this review. Thanks.",

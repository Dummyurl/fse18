I wanted this watch face with the portrayed daily breakdown of several activities on screen at a time. Alas after way too much time messing with settings. It just doesn't work. Thus the face was a waste of time and other precious resources for me.   Other faces sync with Google Calendar just fine. Please fix this, or give a tutorial, and I will gladly increase my review.",

The calanders don't work, the temperature is some three digit number that doesn't make sense, the step counter is way off(just use the Google fit data). I emailed dev about some questions and never heard back. I have the Nixon mission that is listed as a supported watch.",

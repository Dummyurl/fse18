The problems that other users have with the watch appearing would want to check something that I have not seen anywhere, but found out on my own, since I have a lot of watchfaces installed:  It seems that the watchface handler in the Android Wear app can only handle 60 wathcfaces. Once it passed that for me, no new faces would appear. You may have to delete watchfaces, then re-install the one you want for it to appear. That fixed the issue for me.",

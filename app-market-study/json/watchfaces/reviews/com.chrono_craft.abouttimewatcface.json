If you guys can make the ambient mode the same as the face when the watch is active (without animations) I would give it 5 stars. Look at the ranger watch face for example which ambient mode is almost as good as the face when the watch is active",

All watch faces will vastly improve when the pixels are increased. The watch face is HD ready so it will look pixaleted etc until then. The LG watch has a smaller dimension compared to the 360.

All watch faces will vastly improve when the pixels are increased. The watch face is HD ready so it will look pixaleted etc until then. The LG watch has a smaller dimension compared to the 360. Hope this helps :)",

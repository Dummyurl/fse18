I've yet to test how this effects battery life on my LG G watch, but there are very cool scheduling options included in the face settings. I think a few areas could be cleaned up a bit, but overall, this is a fun and unique way of telling time on android wear. If you like the look, this is definitely worth a purchase. This is my new default face!",

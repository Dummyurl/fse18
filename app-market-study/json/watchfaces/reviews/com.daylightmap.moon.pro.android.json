Only thing I would want the option for is to be able to change which part of the moon to have on the first screen.  I'm in the southern hemisphere and being that the phase moves from left to right down here, my second screen to the right is often the more accurate depiction of the moon phase.  So in order to have the correct phase of the moon on my lock screen, I need to make sure I swipe to the second screen before I lock.  Otherwise, perfect app.  Thank you",

Moon Phase will even notify users about upcoming meteor showers, supermoons, as well as the full, quarter, half, and new moon cycles. A live wallpaper of current phase is offered, as well as a resizeable widget. I enjoy keeping one next to my [other] clock on my home screen. I am grateful to know moonrise times too!",

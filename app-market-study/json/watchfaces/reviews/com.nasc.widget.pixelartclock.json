        "comment": "First, let me say the clock is beautiful and the customization is amazing! The only issue I'm having is that it doesn't actually work as a clock. It doesn't update with the time. Sometimes it updates a couple minutes late, and sometimes it keeps up for about a half-hour, but eventually stops updating completely unless I go in the app. A restart fixes it temporarily, but it always stops working. Fix it and I'll definitely buy the in-app purchase.",

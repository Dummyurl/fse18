Adding additional meals (not listed in our diet plan) is possible via manual calories adding. PS We took completely opposite approach than MyFitnesspal - for example.",

I love the suggestions but I'm not about to go out and buy all the food the watch suggest as soon as I download it. :/ The ability to customize would be great. Stream line beautiful interface though. No imperial system, only metric. If we wana get really crazy macros would be a great addition as well.",

It requires a lot of effort (buy, prepare the food), but on the other hand it can generate better results (well balanced diet). We are developing the app, so the real dietitians (&patients) can use it. Stay tuned :)!",

There's no way for me to easily see what my daily calorie threshold is after its been calculated.  Aside from adding up all the meal totals or extrapolating from something else.  For me, I would like to set a threshold and jusy track calories conaumed manually. Ideally I'd like to sync with MyFitnessPal and use this app as a dashboard.  I'd even do a one time payment for just that functionality.",

During beta we will be uploading some updates, one of them including a dashboard, so you can track your calories needs and expenditure, your weight goal, and more, so it's a matter of time. A feature for adding calories manually will come too.",

If manual meal times were an option the app would definitely be 5 stars as it's intuitive and attractive. The automatic meal times though really lowers the usefulness of the app for me.",

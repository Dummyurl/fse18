(I currently have the countdown clock set to vacation start date!).  Only challenge I had was with weather updating.  However, I emailed the designer and he got back to me within a few hours with suggests. Now it works 100%.  Great watchface and great designer!",

It's definitely one of the best looking watch faces out there, however the countdown timer is a bit useless to me & I wish there were more options for what the center button does. It'd also be nice to be able to change the dim mode's colours. As some others have mentioned, I wish I could change the dimming time as well. Great watch face all around.  (My watch is a Nixon Mission SmartWatch).",

Only problem is that the central ring is 1) I find visually unappealing (obv subjective!) but also 2) bit worried about using it on an AMOLED screen 'cos burn in. If there was an option to replace the ring with a 1-2 pixel colored circle (keep glow etc) then it would be a great everyday watch face and would be well worth a $ or so. Or if the ring had a separate dim brightness option I suppose so I could  set it down to like 10%",

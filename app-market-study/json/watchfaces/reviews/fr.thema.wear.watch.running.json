I was not getting step results on my Huawei watch and it was because I had to load Google fit on my phone. Everything worked. Very happy with this watch face. At first I thought the step count was off but it is not. It just takes some time for the steps to show. This is not the watch face's fault. Its a function of android. Nice to have heart rate and step count and the time turns into a stop watch at touch. Very nice. UPDATE: I found that I can use this watch face without google fit on my phone. Just had to Click on the google fit on my watch, scroll to the right past the heart rate, and make sure the fit app on the watch is set to on. Love this watch face.",

It does update correctly when I restart the watch but then gets stuck at that reading no matter what I set the update interval to (15 minutes). As soon as I restart the watch, the correct temperature gets loaded. Edit: it does eventually update but not at the interval specified.",

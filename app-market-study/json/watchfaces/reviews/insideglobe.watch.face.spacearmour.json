Get these problems ironed out and you will have a watch face that will take some beating.",

My main concern was battery life. With the stock watch faces I can put the watch on at 5am and still have 30% left at 10-11pm that night, with the Space Armour watch face it was dead at 3pm.  My other concern was the watch battery indicator remained at 100% the entire day so I actually had no idea it was running out till the Android Wear battery warning popped up saying 15% left.  Good design, but possibly the heart rate monitor needs to be an interval based thing.",

It shows a solid gray background across the entire face in ambient, which isn't good for AMOLED watches. Also there's no option to keep some color in ambient, which many watches now support.",

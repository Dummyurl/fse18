As it is, I can swipe down to view the battery, but it would be nice to just have it on the watch face. This is all that separates it from 5 stars for me",

I tried to reinstall it giving you the benefit of the doubt. This apparently hinders refunds. As the product supplier you should vaguely specify what won't work. The gear watch line of devices are for Androids and wearable. But for 1.83$ you argue.WEEKS LATER  NOOO RESPONSE  NOO REFUND! !  DO NOT BUY   I paid for it, it won't install. And I can't refund it (minutes after buying).",

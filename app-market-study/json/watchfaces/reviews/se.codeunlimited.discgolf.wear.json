I'm then able to put scores in. But at the end, when I lock the game, nothing further happens. My phone shows an empty score card while my phone shows a locked game. Nor sure if I'm missing a step or if there is a problem.",

I think right now this is the only flaw I found, but as long as I turn off the screen I was able to play a round and only lose a small amount of battery. Keep up the good work and I look forward to new updates with improvements.",

If it can be rotated back 90 degrees, it would be straight up 5 stars. I'm so glad someone has made an app for this. Fix the orientation and I'll buy the full version.",

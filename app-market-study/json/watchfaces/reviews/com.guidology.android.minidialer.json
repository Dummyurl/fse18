Consequently, I uninstalled the app.  Yesterday I tried Mini Dialer again.  And wow... what an improvement!  The dialer works great with my S4 and the new features (Contacts, Call Log and Speed Dialer) are really nice.  The only feature that needs to be improved is the Speed Dialer.  The design gives you blank faces of the names/numbers on your speed dial, hence you have no idea of where a number is placed on the speed dialer.  If you cannot put face pics, then I would at least add a number (1-12) to assist with trying to figure out where a speed number is placed.",

Make your decision. Will you get an original, with updates nearly every week, or will you just install a poor copy of it with less functionality?",

If you were directed here looking for the real minimal and elegant, you will be left disappointed. I've let the author of the real app know that someone's trying to copy their app.  KNOW THE DIFFERENCE",

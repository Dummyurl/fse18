        "comment": "Very nice watch face. I like the idea mentioned about having coloured dots or ticks for hours 3, 6, 9 and 12. I have the option of using the GPS or network for weather, It would be good if the watch decided if the GPS was on it would use that, if not then it would use the network. I am also seeing a long string of random numbers instead of the temperature on the Sony Smartwatch 3. I am not keen on the colour schemes. The only reason that I don't use this generally is that the ambient mode looks blocky.",

Also being able to change color or remove the gray circle around the middle would be nice. At last the brightness in ambient mode. I am guessing it's not possible to make it brighter, but if it is, that would be a nice option to have. Btw, it looks like the red preset have the weather icon in a slight more dull red than the rest.",

Things I would like to see: other date formats, not a fan of the current one. Haven't seen it show weather a single time, it's either a bunch of random numbers or it an error picture. Would be neat to have different configurations for always on face and the active one. A few different stiles, the middle circle looks odd to me.",

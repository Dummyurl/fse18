Has everything you need, although the list of tiny 4squares at the bottom of the face which takes you to the main menu,  the little headphone to start the music app fails to do anything & plays nothing,  is really the only gripe I have with it all. Oh, & the little weather icon never changes to anything other than a half moon & doesn't give you accurate weather  'c' temperature.  Change these two gripes & I'll change to 5*",

        "comment": "Love this watch face! It has all the stuff I want, you can change the colors, and some other stuff that I really like having but it doesn't lag the watch like the custom face apps have. I have a couple issues that I would like to see get addressed but they don't effect the overall usability of this watch face.   1. The weather is set to update every hour or every half hour (I have tried both), and it works sometimes but then other times it won't update for like 12 hours, or until I manually go in and hit update. Then it seems to work again for a bit.  2. Changing the color from just tapping the time is a bit annoying. I would like to be able to tap on the weather and stop watch stuff but its so sensitive that I have to keep it \"locked\" which makes those buttons unusable.",

The biggest one being that I wish I could lock the watch face colour without locking all the interactivity. I often accidentally change the colour and need to fix it unless I have the whole face locked. I'd much rather only control the colors from the phone app. Being able to customise the colour of more parts of the face separately and the apps in the button drawer would be good too",

Before this I was using the RichFace NEO WatchFace worked well but I wanted more interactive buttons. Well on this watch face it shows the watch battery level and phone level in graph mode., it show the weather temp and weather icon, at the top of the watch it shows your actual location and if you click on it , the maps come up. Also at the top of the watch you have the steps counter (which does not work for me will explain) it would probably work if I installed the fit app on my phone but I don't need it because the watch face has a google fit shortcut that connects to the google fit that comes on the phone. The phone has so many shortcuts I don't need the wear mini launcher !! You select the shortcuts on your phone and then when you click on the bottom icon a box comes up with 6 apps to select. Very cool. I use the google messenger app on my phone which also connects to my watch and I can receive and send Texts and MMS pictures on the watch. This watch face is one of the few apps that has a shortcut to messenger so I can go to my texts instantly. Like to see it cover even more apps in the future.",

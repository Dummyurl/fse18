You can deactivate it by going in the \"interactivity\" category of the watch face settings ;) EDIT: Glad that everything is now working as expected. Would be great if you can update your rating :)",

        "comment": "Watch: Zenwatch 3 Pros: edited, changed to 5 stars. You'll need premium, it's priced the same or less than most others. With the premium version, there are more options than most others. I like all the different background/color/text color variations available, ability to change up the four widget interactive areas, and the ease of getting the battery levels at a glance (a nice surprise as most battery level indicators are very small and hard to see quickly).   Cons: Noticeably slow to come out of ambient mode and slow to show tap indication and open widget. There is so much great visible area wasted on the inner dials at 3 and 9 o'clock, with the little second hand (redundant) and the dial that says Time (and what does that tell us, it's like a one handed clock). Suggestion, have the TINY three widgets in the bottom of the digital clock be data only and have the three inner dials up top user defined widgets (I.E. Date, Day, Steps, Gmail, Weather, etc) that open appropriate app or user defined app.",

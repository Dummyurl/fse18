        "comment": "The circles around the date, date, and time/battery indicators are a little bit different. When my Galaxy Gear goes into standy-ish mode, it will use less pixels, colors, etc, and therefor the circles will turn blue. Can you check if ALL the colors in the blue mode are exactly the same. Please change the small circles to the outer stripes color. The light blue gives less strain on the eyes and looks better than the small circle blue (in standby-ish mode). If you give me an email address I can send photos.",

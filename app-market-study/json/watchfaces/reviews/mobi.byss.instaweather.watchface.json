What I really, and I mean REALLY dislike is the fact that you CANNOT put wind speed/temperature on the BOTTOM chart type. Why?? There is absolutely no justification for having only certain options available to the top chart type and other ones exclusively for the bottom. You know how nice it would be to both know the temperature and the wind speed? I feel like this was available in the past, or maybe with different watch interfaces offered by the same brand, but PLEASE, just make it so all the top/bottom chart types are interchangeable. That is honestly my only complaint, 5 star application for sure and will be subscribed for years to come.",

The ambient mode will not kick in if the screen dims while anything other than the main watchface is open - the color version will instead stay on the screen with no light.  This drains the battery and risks burn-in on OLED displays.  I only use this app now for the weather complications, but even those frequently crash.  Edit: I am lowering my rating to 2 stars, because there have been many updates that still fail to address this issue.  Would be 1 star, but I use the complication with another watchface.",

It has all kinds of options and you can set your phone up to have as many widgets to show everything from this app as well. I have the radar temp and forecast on my smartwatch and have the same on my phone with the addition of the precipitation. It's a good app to have so you know how the weather is gonna be and I'm no damn bot either I'm real and this app is real. If you look over the little hiccups it may have it will do you some good. Iv had no problems with it myself but people complain about some things. Idk whats wrong with there apps but all you have to do is keep it updated and set it up to sync and it's all good.",

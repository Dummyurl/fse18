One suggestion I have though is to add in the brightness control for dim mode similar to your other app. That helped to make elegant faces even for dim mode and still make it a day or so on battery life. Otherwise,I'll be buying the other apps just to support your development further. Thank you for what you do. This is what Android Wear should have always been.",

I absolutely love this design, and will most likely be looking at the other watch faces this group creates. I'd also love if they somehow added a font/card that allowed this face to look like a nixie tube watch. However, not having that option doesn't detract from the usability and aesthetics of this watch face.",

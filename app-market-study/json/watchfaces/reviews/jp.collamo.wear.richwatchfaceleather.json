        "comment": "Works well, but ended up switching to a different watch face.  What I found most appealing was that the tic marks took into account the light sensor placement on the Moto360, & the added battery indicator.  It will likely sound nitpicky, but here is what would have kept me using this watch face: 1.) Smoother second hand animation. 2.) Option to remove 'Leather Watch' branding from the face. 3.) Text were a bit more bold/crisp on the Moto 360 display.",

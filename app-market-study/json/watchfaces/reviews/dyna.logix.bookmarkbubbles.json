It is one of the only watch faces that truly merges innovation with functionality - not gimmicky and really unleashes the power of Android Wear.   Don't hesitate and get premium to because we need to support developers like this - this guy gets it!   Support is also amazing. Really give it a try and spend time setting it up, you will not be disappointed!   Bumping review for updated version.",

This is possibly the most powerful yet easy app available for Android I have used so far, the software is well written and very stable, and there are clear online guide videos for all aspects of the software.   When this is combined with Tasker, the possibilities are endless, the support is also second to none. I had to contact them on one occasion (which was due to an android bug not a software issue) and they were very quick to respond. If I wasn't so slow with my responses, they would have probably had the issue identified and resolved within an hour.  I am by no means an advanced user but I now have an attractive and streamlined look to both my phone and watch. Well worth every penny of the premium price, I won't be without it now I've used it.",

It provides so much customization and control that there is inherently a bit of a learning curve. Watch the videos, ask the developer questions if need be, and at least learn how to use this before giving the dev one star. This launcher was not easy to create and Stock Android Wear sucks without it. It radically changes the Android Wear experience into something far more intuitive and user fried friendly.

This is the ultimate in personalization for my LG Style watch running Google Wear 2.0, which purrs and growls snarly on demand now. I use a Pixel XL on the Android side with Android 8.1.0. Everyone is amazed at what my rather plain vanilla looking little watch now does and it wouldn't be possible without Bubble Cloud Wear. It takes a little time and effort to understand the tool, but the results are exactly what I want, total control over the UI. It took me about an hour to cozy up to the features, the are many and I have a lot of apps installed. If you are just starting with only a few apps installed, it should take less time to work out what goes where, etc. For you fellow techies, this is what brings out the promise of Google Wear, for me anyway. The Android Widget is equally amazing, BTW. Buy the premium version for the best of both worlds. Seven stars for an outstanding app!",

I love my LEM5 Pro watch it's much more powerful then any Android Wear watches with the 2gb ram 16gb storage and to me it's much more refined with less issues then the Android Wear 2.0 os. It would be awesome if you could one-day try and work in support for them . They have good APIs I've heard . Thanks anyway .

Instead of having a long list of cities, i woud suggest having a list of GMT timezones, and the option to manually name each GMT timezone. This way, everyone can have their own city listed, instead of just one from the list. In addition, it would let people name timezones as \"home\", which would be useful. Another suggestion is to add a toggle to turn off animations completely, including the movement of the sun in flat mode.",

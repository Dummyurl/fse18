Only thing I would like is an option to turn off the icon in the notification bar but that's just a small personal preference. Great job.  Edit: not sure what's going on but recently the snooze button has not been showing up when the alarm goes off. All the settings are the same as when it did. This is a big bug for me hope it's fixed  soon",

I checked and didn't found it. Developer: Please add the option for the never ending alarm unless it's stopped by user and it will be perfect.

Maybe disabling the lock button when in this app, but then you would have to make it unable to leave the app. Aw but I just thought of another work around...taking out the battery and you can't control that",

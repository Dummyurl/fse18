        "comment": "The watch face is very beautiful and looks like a real, expensive and well-designed watch But there are some negatives I found: 1. Too quickly goes to energy saving mode, I'd like to show off my 'real' watch 2. As others reviewers mentioned, no date display, I think it could fit the design scheme without spoiling it - most of the expensive watches have it anyway 3. In the energy-saving mode, the digits are too close to the center. I understand, that they are on the same position as in the 'normal' face, but still it leaves huge empty space between the numbers and the bezel, and since this mode is used most of the time, makes the otherwise expensive looking watch, look cheap and funny 4. The orange 'minutes/seconds' ring, around the white hours ring duplicates the physical ring around the display of the LG G Watch R - there could be an option to remove it, and make the hour numbers closer to the bezel  But the biggest problem is, that the normal watch face doesn't use the whole display, there are around 10 pixels in each direction, that the face doesn't use ?!?  LG G Watch R here",

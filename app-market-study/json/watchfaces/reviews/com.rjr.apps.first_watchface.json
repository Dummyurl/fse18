As always in good design, form follows function.  This watch face would have far more users, if only it wasn't hidden behind a plethora of silly, junk faces, that have populated the Google Play store. Admitedly, its a bit tricky to customise, but then, we don't have the advantage of Force Touch, as on the Apple Watch, do we?  I don't need my watch to tell me how many steps I've made, or when to take a dump - surprisingly, I've already got that stuff under control. What I need to know is when are my next few appointments, and do I need my umbrella or warm coat when I go out - things like that, outside my immediate control.  This watch face allows you to do that, and elegantly too.",

I just wish there were an option to change the wording to be Ten O' Three instead of Ten Zero Three. And for there to be clock hands in the background to go with the time, but you can't have everything, so I still love it! :)",

There is a lot of variety in this pack, so you don't feel like you have just a bunch of \"one type\" of style of watch faces to choose from. I personally find it good to have lots of different faces to choose from to fit my outfit or my mood or both!!!! I recommend you download these.",

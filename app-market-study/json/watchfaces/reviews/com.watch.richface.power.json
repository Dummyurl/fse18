I'll update the review if the developer responds and resolves it. Update: the developer responded and said they couldn't fix it and refunded my money. It's a shame because it's a really nice looking watch face.",

        "comment": "Love all the apps from this developer. Especially this one.  My only complaint is how they implement the weather info system in their faces. It's very simplistic. It requires location to be on all the time to get the info and the location selection option doesn't work AT ALL. It doesn't detect what state is put in, just the city. There's more than on of my cities in the US.  I have a few other watch faces that use a method that doesn't require location to be on indefinitely to be able to get weather stats. It allows you to pick a location from a map and it refreshes every so often. You don't need to have location on.    It would be greatly appreciated if the developer could either overhaul the system these other faces use or at least fix the location selection option so it actually works.",

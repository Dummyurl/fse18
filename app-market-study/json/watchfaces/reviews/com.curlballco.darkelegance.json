All my other faces work fine.  The bottom small dial also was always missing hands. Not very good service for a paid face.",

Watchface is now unusable) I'm not one to buy apps but I just couldn't resist with this watch face. It truly is beautiful and simplistically amazing! Only change I would make is to update so the flat tire isn't as obvious like the special version of this watch face. Regardless 5-starts and thanks for the awesome watch face! (:",

No lag or changing of colors at all when the watch awakes from sleep. Keep up the good work and please make more watch faces! Im gonna buy all of your faces,  even the pink one for breast cancer month. :)",

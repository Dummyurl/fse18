The watch face color toggle in settings no longer works; I cannot lock in my selected color, and always risk changing it by touching the watch face. The ability to activate \"Ok Google\" by tapping the watch face also does not work. Furthermore, the weather forecast does not even display current day's forecast--only the next several days. I have no idea what the high or low will be later on today. Not worth the $1",

But, all the options seem to be broken, there's a \"change color on tap\" option that cycles to a random color watch face when you tap the watch, which is extrenly annoying and is still doing it with the option off.  Short cuts work fine most of the time, but they will completely stop working (but still show on the watch) for no reason, and I have to reset the app settings everytime to fix it  And after spending $1 (not a lot I know) I expect the premium options to be premium and work.",

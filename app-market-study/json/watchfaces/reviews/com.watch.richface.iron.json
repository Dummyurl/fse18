Despite the interactive setting being turned off, it still changes the color when I tap at the bottom... It also doesn't obey the option to not show taps... that setting is also off yet I still see the circle where I tap.",

I really like the functionality of this face.it doesn't throttle down my watch when I use it. I'm very happy with it. I hope they keep up the good work because making an app for smart watches or phones even is a hard thing to do. Believe me I've made a few apps myself for personal use designed specifically for my rooted HTC one m8. Keep up the good work and thank you for such a great app for my watch. :)",

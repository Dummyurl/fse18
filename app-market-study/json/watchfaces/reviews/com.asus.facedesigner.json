        "comment": "I have an old Zenwatch 1 and it works great for that. It has a few built-in face backgrounds, dials, and hands that you can use to quickly build your own watch face. If you don't like the provided options you can use your own. I haven't tried using my own background, dials, or hands yet because I was satisfied just using the defaults. There are also widgets you can add for extra information like watch battery level, phone battery level, day, date, weather, steps, etc...  My only gripe is that the ambient screen is limited to just time. You can't put widgets on the ambient screen. You can't even put the day and date on the ambient screen. If they would allow widgets (or at least day and date) in the ambient screen I would raise my rating from 3 to 5.",

You can theoretically import additional ones, but there's not a lot of options for finding that sort of thing online. Useful for wallpaper and not much else. Gave it 4 stars since there aren't any alternatives that do the same thing. After custom making my watch face, I don't like anyone else's.",

Plus, add the option to rotate the text / icons on the watch face. Some of the stock built in watch faces have rotated text so that would be wonderful to see in this app as well.

I like the inclusion of epox time though the only time I would use it is for very precise time measurements such as when something happened noteworthy. And utc time I use with all my friends all over the world so we can easily coordinate Skype calls and online gaming sessions",

The sample watch face from google is kinda complicated in some parts but your github link cleared it all up for me, now I finally understand how to correctly implement settings in my own watchfaces :D  So I've bought it as a thank you for the source code which helped me a lot ^^",

Uninstall DevOps Time; 2. Reboot watch; 3. Reboot phone; 4. Install DevOps Time; 5. Wait 5 minutes; 6. Check the Android Wear app. Hopefully that gets you back on track.",

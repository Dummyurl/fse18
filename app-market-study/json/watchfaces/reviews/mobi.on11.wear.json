I saw many posts on Reddit mentioning about this bug, e.g. http://t.co/sT82PwOmxX http://t.co/75TkQLxxU1 . Pls wait Google to fix it. Meanwhile, send me an email if you want to know the details. :)",

This is caused by the limited bandwidth of Bluetooth communication and installation speed on Android Wear watches. Email me if it does not show up after 5 minutes. Thanks. qhe@wpi.edu",

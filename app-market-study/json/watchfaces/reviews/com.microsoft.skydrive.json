I didn't use the app for about 3 months, then about a week ago, I logged in and ALL OF MY FILES WERE DELETED! they decided to change the free storage amount to only 5 gb.",

I used to use DropBox to sync my pictures from my phone, until the few gigabytes of free space was filled and I decided to switch to OneDrive because it offered more space for the money when paying (at the time). OneDrive lumps all of the folders I sync that contain pictures into one big group, rather than keeping them separated and foldered (as DB did) and it absolutely refuses to sync on it own (as DB did). I have it set to sync whether on wifi or mobile, whether it's charging or not, and my phone's Sync setting is turned on. I even have OneDrive set to be ignored by the device monitor so it won't be closed or impeded in the background, and STILL the pictures from the chosen folders only sync when I actually open the app and go to the pictures tab, and only if the phone is charging! WHY are the settings even there if they aren't really going to apply?!? Since the price and data amount I originally started with (the whole reason I switched services) no longer exist for new customers, I would certainly recommend going with DropBox instead...",

And now this app won't let me switch to my older/other Onedrive account. At login I signed in with my older account and its password, but it won't let me log in. But when I sign in with my other/newer account, it works fine. But I need to log in to my older account!   HELP!!!",

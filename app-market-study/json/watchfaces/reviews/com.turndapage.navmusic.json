It might not be updating Android's media store while it transfers, in which case, no other app would know that the files were added.

Playback works great, as well as shuffle/skip etc and I really like being able to reorder my music by artist/album etc.  Ditch Google Play Music and it's awkward process for transferring music to your watch - get this app now and you won't look back!!!",

Transferring files using FTP is very fast and is a lot easier than any of the other methods I've come across.  Hopefully there will be support for playlists, or at least folders, in a future version.  Also, I'd like to be able to change the background color to black.  The type (names of songs, etc.) is small and hard to read - a black background and perhaps a bolder font would certainly help.",

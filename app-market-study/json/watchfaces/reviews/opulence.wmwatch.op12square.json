        "comment": "I LOVE your work. Your faces are amazing and elegant. I have to say that this face is far too tiny on the LG G Watch. I can barely read it. I know you mainly do round faces. That doesn't make your work any less. You are by far one of the best. I just wish you would extend out to more square faces. If you'd be so kind to edit this from a round inside a square face to a true square face it would be much appreciated. Keep up the great work. You're a true artist!",

The analog and digital watch face are overlayed on the same complication unless you use the weather background. You cannot see the battery percent from the phone. You cannot click on the weather complication to see the weekly forecast. You cannot click on the clock to set a timer. Used to be great, now I'm off looking for a new watch face.",

Added it back and I struggled to get back my old setup. Initially had issue getting analog time to go away after I selected digital time. Now that's okay, but all other changes I've made seem to be displaying on top of previous item. I would MUCH rather manage this from my phone. UPDATE: battery drain is bad. Changed watch to only come out of ambient when I tap rather than move wrist to conserve. But now digital time doesn't display correctly in ambient - seems to display current overlaid with prior, which makes it unreadable. Not acceptable for a smart WATCH app to not have readable time. :(",

I rated it 5 stars because it works exactly as advertised and is good enough that I am making it my new watch face even though there are others that are much nicer from a design standpoint. But this one offers me the most information at a glance, and that's why I bought my Wearable watch in the first place. I would happily pay a buck or two for a premium version with more designs and options.",

I've done everything you said to other people and it does the same, the problem lies within the code because older versions worked fine. Also, it would be great it the weather won't rely on the location, a way to choose a city in the app settings would be great.",

This is one of my favorite watch faces and would be my default face if it had those missing features. I use a different one with custom shortcuts for work. Add the missing features I mention and will change to 5*!",

Unfortunately I've stopped using this because the splash screen that comes up everytime I raise my wrist despite using the always on option and this ruins the watchface as the small wait makes glacing at the watch pointless",

        "comment": "The idea is lovely. It uses a different count of steps than the actual Fit app so most likely these 2 will not match, which is OK. What I couldn't understand was the battery drain. My moto 360 lasts me whole day and 1 night. With this watch face running the new 5.1.1 It didn't last 12 hours. I changed the face for Driver and I was back on my regular consumption. So I just can assume it was the watch face Geox. Not uninstalling, I will wait for an update that addresses this issue.",

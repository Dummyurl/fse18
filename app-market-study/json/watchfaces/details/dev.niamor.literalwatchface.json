        "Pretty cool. Wish it supported ambient mode. Like if the foreground letters got dim and  background letters disappeared.  As it is it is probably pretty easy on battery with my HW2 classic.",
        "LOVE it!  It's exactly what I've been looking for and Romain helped me figure out why it wasn't working with my Zenwatch 2!",
        "Would be nice to at least have a battery icon. But still, loved it!",
        "Couldn't get it to show up as a watchface option.",
        "Quality Watch Face A very nice watch face, looks just like the real qlocktwo. No complaints.",
        "Works great! I like all the options... The best part is being able to change the language. Thanks!!"

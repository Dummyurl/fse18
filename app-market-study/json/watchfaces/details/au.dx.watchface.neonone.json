        "Nice design but has issues Very nice watch face. I like the idea mentioned about having coloured dots or ticks for hours 3, 6, 9 and 12. I have the option of using the GPS or network for weather, It would be good if the watch decided if the GPS was on it would use that, if not then it would use the network. I am also seeing a long string of random numbers instead of the temperature on the Sony Smartwatch 3. I am not keen on the colour schemes. The only reason that I don't use this generally is that the ambient mode looks blocky.",
        "Different yet beautiful... But Some more tweaks would be nice. Like an option to make the dials linear. I am not a fan of the thick to thin shape. Also being able to change color or remove the gray circle around the middle would be nice. At last the brightness in ambient mode. I am guessing it's not possible to make it brighter, but if it is, that would be a nice option to have. Btw, it looks like the red preset have the weather icon in a slight more dull red than the rest.",
        "Need for customization options It looks very nice, haven't found anything similar or cool lucking yet. But for a paid watch face it's lacking a lot of things. Things I would like to see: other date formats, not a fan of the current one. Haven't seen it show weather a single time, it's either a bunch of random numbers or it an error picture. Would be neat to have different configurations for always on face and the active one. A few different stiles, the middle circle looks odd to me.",
        "Make an app The UX on the watch to change the watch face is so stupid. Please make an app on the phone to do this. Would have been so much easier",
        "Unable to change settings When opening the menu on the phone to fine tune options it just opens to a empty screen. Additionally cannot seem to change any settings on the watch itself.",
        "Nice Looking, Needs More I really think it's a great looking watch face, but the date and battery data just clutters the face. Would be nice to be able to move them up to the top."

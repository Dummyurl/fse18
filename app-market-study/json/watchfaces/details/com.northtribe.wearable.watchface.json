        "Let down by ambient mode A great looking watch face which is let down by a plain ambient mode. It would be better if the ticks and numbers were shown there.",
        "Great clean look with a classic design yet modern touch. Just the pieces of data that I want quick access to. Best of all, battery life is amazing. Even with always on enabled and brightness of 3, the battery is only at 73% even after 10+ hours of normal use!",
        "Not a bad looking watch face by any means, but if you're going to charge for the app then there needs to be customization options available.",
        "Why not listed? After installation...why not listed on my adroid wear apps?...I can not install it...what should I do?. I have Huawei Watch with Samsung S7 edge....pls reply asap...thx",
        "Nice graphics, but I need a square version for my Watch.",
        "Attractive but can't change Settings Only option is to Install Settings."

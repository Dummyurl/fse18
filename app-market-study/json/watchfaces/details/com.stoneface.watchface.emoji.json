        "Nice watch It's a really nice watch, but the seconds do not move when the screen is dimmed. Also, maybe you can add notifications on the dimmed screen. I'm using Xperia Z3",
        "I love it! It will be better if it have animated emojis! Please add some animation effect!",
        "Love this!!!! Very original face. My new favorite!!!!!! Perfect as is, but animations or interactive features would be cool :)"

        "I am having issues with the app. I used to have it long ago and was working nice. Now for some reason you cannot freeze the background so when you swipe it changes and also i found a bug in s8 plus. When i am in the home screen, if i tap anywhere it automatically swipes to the end of the image. Very annoying.",

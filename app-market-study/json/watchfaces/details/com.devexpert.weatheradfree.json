        "Has been great for several years. But recently has refused to update, even if I open app & refresh manually. Seems maybe an issue with weather providers for me area? Will uninstall for now but will try it again later. I have greatly loved this app, esp its ability to be set to hone in on tiny local climate areas! No other app is like this. Would be very happy to pay for special features if needed to make this work again as before in my obscure geographical area.",
        "This app's two weather prediction data sources are consistently 3-6 degrees F higher than actual temps as well as other sites like Weather Channel.  Weather prediction that isn't close to reality is useless.  Odd because this phenomenon with the two included providers started happening about 6 weeks ago.  Perhaps it is time to look for a replacement weather app that uses good data sources.",
        "I love the customizability of the widgets, which are not only informative about the weather, but actually function as better clock widgets that the ones for my clock app. My only (tiny) quibble is that there doesn't seem to be a way to display rain probability as a percentage instead of an estimated depth (i.e. in, or mm). All in all I'd say it's a great app.",
        "Quite customizable and not overly informative widget. My gripe lays in non symmetrical hi/lo placement (should be centered to weather icon). Also, could use distinct color options per time, date, forecasts. Developer should group similar settings (eg. Units: imperial vs. metric, then the specifics to each class). As is but a roster with addendums.",
        "Nice and simple but could do with a widget with 24 hour clock on it. Also not compatible with my tablet. On watch the app doesn't display properly. Rating due to the compatibility problems which weren't previously there and developer doesn't respond to emails",
        "It's amazing application. It does what it supposed to. I use it for just what it is, weather and time. I do not know what else this application does, but it's worth it and it has remove the ads option which all the applications should have. I hate ads, because spyware and viruses can wreck your phones. BUY IT! 5-Stars!"

        "Crashes instantly on Moto 360 Gen 1. EDIT: Don't even get a message, it just crashes the whole watch and won't turn on again without me putting it on the charger. If you think it's incompatible, I'll remove the review.",
        "Very nice minimalistic but futuristic watch face! The Android app on my Asus Padfone crashes at launch instantly, but fortunately the app on my Asus Zenwatch 3 is running okay! Would be five stars if the companion app on my mobile would work though. :-)",
        "Worked good on my Zenwatch 2 before the AW2 update. After that this app made my watch completely unusable. The cpu was always tied up making the watch unresponsive to touch.  Eventually I got it uninstalled and now the watch works great and responds to touch.",
        "I don't think that this app it's nougat compatible yet, because when I open the app on my Pixel it crashes without and crash reports and it wouldnt sync with my moto360 2 gen. I would like this use this and I will change my review once I can use it but I do like the concept",
        "A really fun, short game that you can play on your watch. And the watch face on the \"menu\" screen is really nice looking! I want it to become an actual watch face.",
        "Crashes after install on moto 360 2nd, twice, then works just fine. Great app."

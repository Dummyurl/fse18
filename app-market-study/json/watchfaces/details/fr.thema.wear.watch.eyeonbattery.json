        "Professional looking watch face that is functional and looks good in ambient and active screen mode.  I only wish for Roman numerals option.",
        "Like simple classic look, does not drain battery.",
        "Great Face I love the clean look of this watch face and the ability to customize the color. I just don't like the color picker when adjusting the color from my phone. It is way too hard to make small adjustments. It would be nice to be able to enter RGB codes or something.  Also, moving the adjustment down seems to just dim the screen on my watch rather than really affecting the color.",
        "Perfect for your round smartwatch My favourite analogue face for my G Watch R by a big margin. Simple and elegant. Looks great in ambient mode too.",

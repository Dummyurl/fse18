        "It's cool but... I love the Zero Escape franchise and a watch face based on it is awesome, but why does it have to be a 24 hour clock? And the it's hard to tell the time because the numbers are so small and blend in with the background a little. I like it a lot but I need a watch face that I can just glance at real quick and see what time it is.",
        "Seems interesting I like the idea but can't find the app in either my apps list or widgets where is it stored.",
        "Oh, Android Wear exclusive. Meh. Three stars for the idea.",

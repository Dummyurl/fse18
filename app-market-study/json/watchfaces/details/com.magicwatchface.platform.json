        "Almost Many good features about this app Such as awesome stock faces and cool customization,  but the weather is very inaccurate. Living in San Diego   I am fairly certain it's not going to rain for the next 3 weeks straight,  and it's not 82° at 8pm in February.  Inaccurate weather can be a deal breaker for most smart watch owners.  Fix the weather problem and I give 5 stars.",
        "Please fix the weather The weather  currently displays 77°F. It is 10°F here. Obviously wrong. Isn't the app able to use phone location? I am uninstalling until fixed. May have to cancel my subscription as well.",
        "They're nice But there's no access to settings, the weather didn't appear to work, and the G+ community appears to have been abandoned",
        "Great and simple watch faces. I'd love to give it 5 stars, but a lot of the really neat faces are only available in 24 hour mode with no ability to toggle it to 12 hour.",
        "Awesome faces to choose from, but... ...weather reports as 82 degrees every day. I live in Illinois, so this is quite impossible in March!",
        "No Square watch face faces All the watch faces are for round wears and nothing for square face. Although its applicable to square but it will be better if you provide settings to choose between square and round."

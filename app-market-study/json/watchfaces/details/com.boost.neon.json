        "I like the look and how easy it is to read.  I would like to see the position of the month and day of the week switched, though.  I think it's more important to have the day of the week in large text, than to have the month show up there.",
        "Love it Love the watchface. One nice new feature would be a setting that changes the color once a day.",
        "Good! I don't understand certain things on screen that seems they have no function  just effects of color. It would be better if it were interactive.",

        "It's okay The quote changes each time I tap my watch. I would love it if the quote can stay on the watch face a little longer so we read it. Maybe add or change the quote every hour. Like it but it need little work.",
        "Very nice, but needs a little work Lovely clean look and I love the concept, unfortunately though the digital face positions the time so that it's unreadable if there's a notification on screen (making it useless when music is playing!)It would be nice to be able to configure the quote refresh time in settings too. Will keep an eye on this face though as I do really like the design :)",
        "It doesn't have the date, although the description says it has date on/off customization.",
        "It needs a bit of tweaking which includes the date",

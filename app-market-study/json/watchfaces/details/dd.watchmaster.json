        "The watch faces they have are mostly decent, some are very well done. The problem is there just isn't enough of them. Not for the price you pay per year. Also, it's taking a very long time for them to fix the coming soon no connection issue. So at the moment, not only are you stuck with a limited number of watch faces to choose from, but there are zero new ones coming in. It's been like this for nearly a month. This app could well be one of the better ones, but still lacks in a lot of areas.",
        "Love the watchface designs \"the classyness of them\" wish they had more of a clickable interface.. I would be giving a 4 Star review if almost every month now it keeps on telling me in no longer pro & asks me to subscribe again... even tho I'm subbed till 10/10/18...? Please fix this issue & I'll up the review",
        "It stopped working with the new tizen 3.0 update. Please fix the issue. I love this app. Thanks for the response. But it doesn't detect my watch..",
        "One of the MOST expensive watch face apps and has the FEWEST faces. Totally regret my purchase of $16.99. Basically the same number of faces from 11/2016 (approximately 400). This app is NOT worth the money.",
        "Coming soon watch face error conection, please fix it",
        "After the last update coming soon watchfaces cannot be seen"

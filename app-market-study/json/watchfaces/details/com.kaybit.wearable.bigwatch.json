        "It's good but... Ambient mode doesn't appear to work right. Still the same after the update, black background with dark grey number colours (same as my active combo) will just turn the screen black on ambient mode. Seems to only work with a very light number colour. Still using it though. Asus zenwatch",
        "I really like this watch face it's not a bad watch face at all it's got big digits and I really love it. Especially the fact that I can actually read it in a way that it could be read. Keep up the good work oh and did I forget to mention I like the color schemes the background especially green for the numbers and red for the background because it reminds me of Christmas keep up the good work I think you guys do a lot of thinking that goes into this that's what makes me realize this watch is very good I'm in the watch face that is so it just keep up the good work and I think you'll have a lot more good thoughts about it thank you",

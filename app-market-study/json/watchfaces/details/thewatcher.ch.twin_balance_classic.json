        "Dose not work in LG urbane 2nd edition. It shows in a corner of the screen. It only works in old devices who's resolution is 360x360. Almost all new devices has resolution more than that. A paid watch like this should not have this kinds of flaws.",
        "Looks great but... Not compatible with Huawei, really wish it was. Such a nice watch. I see the watch in the far left corner of my screen",
        "Gorgeous classic watchface.",
        "SUPER COOL",
        "Unfortunate. Love this watch face but it does not work on my moto360 second gen. The watchface loads but does not fill the screen Radius. I'm guessing it isn't meant to work with the newer version of the 360. Grabbed a refund but would re-purchase if this was fixed.",
        "Not compatible with Moto 360 v2 Definitely would consider buying if compatibility issues are resolved."

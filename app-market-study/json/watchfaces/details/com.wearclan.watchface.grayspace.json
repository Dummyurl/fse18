        "Not bad. Love the design but... It needs a proper square face comparability, rather than shrinking a round face. You lose too much \"real estate\" on a square watch.",
        "Battery and temperature seems to be stuck after first applying. Sad, it does look great. Uninstalled.",
        "Looks great, but it's a massive battery drain on the LG G Watch R - the ambient mode needs to be fully black & white because of its OLED display, whereas your ambient mode is just toned down normal mode, which means I can't really use it.",
        "Gray space watch face Sexy looking!!!!!",
        "عالی",
        "So so Looks OK, although very grainy on the Huawei watch. Temperature never actually displayed anything and there's not enough of a difference between the ambient and non-ambient screen."

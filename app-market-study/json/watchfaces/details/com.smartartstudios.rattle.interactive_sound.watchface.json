        "Not quite what I expected although nice looking the time displayed is far too small. Steps does not update. I'd suggest losing the ring between the battery gauge and clock to increase the size of objects inside the ring. Also does not support wear 2 complications which would be nice option. Will revisit after a while to see if improvements are made. Edit. Bigger watch face is a great addition 1 extra star",
        "Good",
        "Looks nice but the version you download from the play store has zero functionality. You can't tap on any of the watch icons for weather, calendar etc and none of the many settings shown in the configuration  screen can be changed so no way to assess if it's worth paying for the premium version. Complete waste of time.",

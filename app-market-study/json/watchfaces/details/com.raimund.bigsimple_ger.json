        "Euro Time??? We don't tell time in 24hr format here in the United States. Please add 12hr format as well. Also the date and month should be formatted Monday/October/20... Uninstalling and will check back for an update. There is a rest of the world too. Had installed for over 2 months and I'm sure I'm not the first to mention this.",
        "Love the design. 24-hour time is much cooler than 12-hour time. Easier to set an alarm to and not confuse am with pm. What's so difficult about deducting 12 from a number to figure out the time?",
        "Needs more work Needs a 12 hour mode and more customization features."

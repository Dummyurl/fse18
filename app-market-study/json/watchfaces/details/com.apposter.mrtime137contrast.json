        "Like it but... When my watch goes into sleep/dim mode the long and short hands change to the opposite of what the actual time is. So if the actual time is 3:00pm, when my watch dims it changes 12:15pm cause the hands change. Any ideas why? Otherwise I like the watch face.",
        "Not up to standard Unfortunately the watchface is too difficult to see. On paper it looks good, possibly even on an emulator but in a real life scenario, on my Lg G Watch Urbane it did not look really good. Sorry guys, I know its meant to be \"Contrast\" but some more luminance is needed. Ambient mode is too simple as well."

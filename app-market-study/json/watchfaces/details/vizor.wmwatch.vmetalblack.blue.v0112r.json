        "Great design, small flaws. Overall, one of the best designs I've seen. Very sleek, and functional. Ambient colors and design could be improved, but overall awesome face. I have problems on my Moto 360 2nd gen, where trying to close a secondary screen (like options or weather), I have to tap just above the \"X\" icon to close. Tapping the actual close button does nothing. Please look into this.",
        "Functional & Great looking Probably the best watch face I've come across to date. Great if we could see more watch faces from VizorWatch with the calender notifications included around the clock and more visual features such as an RSS feed scroll somewhere on the watch face and more animation features.",
        "Beautiful and functional This is by far my favorite watch face. It looks great and adds a lot of cool functionality.",
        "Nice design The watch looks great, sunset and Sunrise would be a nice add. I also feel like my watch battery drains faster while using this watch. My thoughts, still deserve 5* for nice design",
        "In the description it states 12/24 hour time but it will cost you to change it.  The temp is centigrade only.  I can't use it as it is. 12/30/15 Thank you for the info to change C to F. I just re-read the description and on my copy it does state: \"12 time, 24 Time, Battery level.....\"",
        "Can't find it Looks like a cool face, but when I download it it doesn't show up anywhere on my watch or phone."

        "Minimal, functional, and clean. Also I appreciate the fact it doesn't add anything to my app drawer.",
        "Neat idea and implementation. It would be great if the text (the time) could stay in the middle, in between the end and the start of the line that goes all the way around.",
        "nice but needs battery thanks...cool thanks dev",
        "Works after rebooting all Works now.",
        "There's a glitch! On changing from dimmed mode to active mode, the seconds circle does not move. Only after sliding right/left or opening any app, the seconds circle starts moving. Otherwise a nice looking watch face",
        "Very pretty watch face I like how minimal you can make it, but I have some Ideas for future options: Make a switch to turn the text in the circles on/off, Add settings for ambient mode (I can't find any), maybe add an option to completely disable a circle (I personally only need/use 2)"

Easy: Just select the \"extract color from photo\" option in the new colorchooser interface, take a photo of yourself and select the correct color.

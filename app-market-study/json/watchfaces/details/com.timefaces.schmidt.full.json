        "Best watch face ever.  Won't know until Saturday, but the Lite version has poor Herr Schmidt going to the office on both Saturday and Sunday.   Would be awesome to see some weekend activities, maybe even Friday night pub, or Wednesday date-night with the wife, maybe a game of bridge or canasta?",
        "I like it but... It would be good to be able to change the date format ie. to dd/mm/yy as most  people are not North American and weekend activities would be great also. Otherwise good job!",
        "Great with two caveats I love it, beautiful drawings. Great and simple idea, gentle on ðŸ”‹ life. But: I have never seen mr Schmidt waking up nor brushing his teeth - I guess it happens quite early in the morning. Furthermore I do not like the fact that during weekends it still shows Mr Smith working at his desk. Can you add an image of Mr Schmidt mowing the lawn or reading the newspaper? Or even going for a walk with his wife?",
        "Love the concept However having paid for the app I would expect just a bit more CUSTOMIZATION. I mean there is not even an option for am/pm. Not weather display. No watch or phone percentages. The only reason I'm not requesting a refund is in hopes you will implement at least some of these features and the fact the concept is great. I will update my review accordingly...",
        "Very nice! Thk u for the 12 hr time! Maybe the phone and battery levels can also be a click on the time deal.. Love the art work! 2 requests, put 12 hr time and also an icon 4 watch and phone battery charges. My last watch face had them. My cell died during the night and I didn't no bcse nothing on watch face, on my wrist as I slept.",
        "I find this creation very fun, love the graphics and love the different picture scenarios that change throughout the course of the day.  I agree with the masses, please create weekend/recreational scenes.  :)"

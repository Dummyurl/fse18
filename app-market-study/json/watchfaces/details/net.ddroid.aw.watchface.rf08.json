        "After installing the app doesn't show up on the phone. One has to go thru the watch to open the app on the phone to change any settings. Also the weather data wind speed shown incorrect, like the actual wind is known to be approx 9 kts it shows 41 kts on the watch face.",
        "It's a good concept but weather and wind speed are definitely wrong email me when you fix problems I'll 're buy it but asking I get a refund atm for it not working correctly",
        "Great until it completely stopped working",
        "After temperature shown hundreds of Celsius for sometimes, now it stops not  display temp anymore. Graphics is not crisp but acceptable. 3 timezones is very useful to me anyway.",
        "Great watch face, but sadly all my watch face from this developer now show stupid weather temperatures.  It is telling me it is currently 278 celsius. Last time I checked I was on  earth, not Mercury.",
        "weather temps totally useless. Nothing in the app shows were the temps are coming from."

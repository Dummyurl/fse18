        "As it says free smartwatch faces, well the only thing free was my time installing the application, did not work for me on any of the 5 various smartwatches that I have,  anyhow it doesn't matter as I have decided to uninstall this application for now.  Thanks development team, really appreciate your help with this matter please don't hesitate to fix this matter.  Ranting over..   PLZ FIX..üòÅ",
        "It is a great app but, now that I switched phones I have to pay again? All other apps don't make you pay twice. Don't buy premium version if you're thinking of switching phones any time soon",
        "I loved the non HD version of this app on my G Watch and now that I've got a higher resolution watch, I like this app and its various faces even more. Definitely worth checking out.",
        "First was duped by the split sales deal non HD vs HD.  Then after buying both versions the HD push button doesn't work while the non HD does.",
        "Love these watch faces. Would be even better if it had support for complications on Android Wear 2.0",
        "Free watchfaces are never bad!  I like the faces, just don't care too much for the vuxia branding.  Would be cool to add your name there..."

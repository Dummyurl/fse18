        "I like how this looks on my SW3. And I am happy to have a watch face that shows me the temperature. I turned off the animation. But I wish I could turn off modules, or at least change the date format and turn off the labels - they're kind of dorky (\"atomic\").  It doesn't look as smooth as stock faces in ambient mode, but pretty good, which is what I see most because I use 'always on'. I would like this more if the 4 lines that remain across the screen went away in ambient mode.",

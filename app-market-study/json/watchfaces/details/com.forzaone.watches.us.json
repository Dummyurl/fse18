        "So this is a plain watch with nothing at the end of the watch hands yet the British one has a football attached to it? Why aren't there guns on one and dead people on the other? Stupid watch face that shows the ignorance of the face maker and their country.",
        "I wanted to love this watch face, but it is almost impossible to actually tell what time it is. Whose brilliant idea was it to use white hands against a red/white/blue background If the watch hands were black or any color other than white ( red or blue) it would be 5 stars",
        "Great! This simple design looks great on my Moto 360",
        "It won't install",
        "Awso",
        "Very good resolution.  Its a great way to show the American flag.  Besides, its free so who am I to complain lol."

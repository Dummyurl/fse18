        "Weather feature needs work The weather is based off current time zone, as opposed to actual location. So even though I'm in salt lake city, I'm getting the weather for Denver (which is in the same time zone).",
        "Crashes at first. When I get it to appear in my watch, 3d does not work & color does not change during night time. Original & flat design both not working.  I tried uninstalling & installing it 4 times. Still the same.Please fix it.",
        "Travelers Dream Awesome app for travelers who want to keep tabs with their time at home.  It would be awesome if we could change the weather source to AccuWeather or another weather app that could sync better. Wouldn't mind doing away with the seconds either.",
        "It started out great, our adult children are missionaries overseas so with this app I can tell what time it is there...But it only worked for two days and now it force closes all the time and can't use it at all now. Please help me to fix this problem...",
        "Great, but needs some tweaks This is a great watchface well worth the 99c for a traveller (and for style points). Instead of having a long list of cities, i woud suggest having a list of GMT timezones, and the option to manually name each GMT timezone. This way, everyone can have their own city listed, instead of just one from the list. In addition, it would let people name timezones as \"home\", which would be useful. Another suggestion is to add a toggle to turn off animations completely, including the movement of the sun in flat mode.",
        "Be nice if face was bi colour Would be nice to have choice of colours, not just if one is am and one pm. The sun moon would still show that..seconds need to be off for battery. An extra star for the response.. Action on the seconds is needed. It eats the battery. Apart from that it's a great watch and a widget! I've paid for less. Especially like the widget. All watches should do this. Oh a star for that! BE NICE TO SEE OTHER WATCHES GIVE A WIDGET TOO. LOOKS GREAT AND BEING DUEL TIME IS SOMETHING I'D TROUBLE WITH FINDING A NICE ONE:))9*"

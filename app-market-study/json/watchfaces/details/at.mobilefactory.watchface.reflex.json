        "Great simple Watch face Too many are complex eye sores eating the watches battery.  I like that you can control the ambient screen brightness, be cool if you can change it by the time of day. Noon very bright, 10pm half brightness",
        "Does not let me add to my Huawei. Watch it worked on there before I payed for this app and now it won't work help. My favorite watch face",
        "Very nice. Animations are great. Doesn't need additional customisation in my opinion. I wouldn't worry about such requests. Leave it simple and stylish. Looking forward in seeing more from you guys",
        "One Major Bug This is a great looking watch face. My only problem is that it flashes on/off when my Moto 360 is charging. No other watch face does this.",
        "Great but issue when watch charging Really good watch face.  However, if I put Moto 360 on the charger, the charging clock face repeatedly flashes off and on.  To deal with this, I have to select an alternative watch face before placing on the charger.",
        "Close to great but... My favourite 360 watch face with classy colours and animations. BUT watch flashes on and off constantly when on charge. 5 stars when fault fixed."

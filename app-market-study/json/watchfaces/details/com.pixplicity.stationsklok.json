    "description": "This Android Wear watch face resembles the Dutch railway clocks. By design, the second hand makes its rounds two seconds too fast, and waits every minute to 'synchronize with the mother clock' before it continues. Just like the real railway clocks!This watch face features the following:• A synchronization pause every minute;• A second hand that slides smoothly from tick to tick;• A minute hand that bounces a little every minute;• Shadows beneath the hands that move along with the movements of your wrist!To use this watch face, long-press the background on your Android Wear and select 'Stationsklok'. Or select it using the Android Wear app on your phone.Please note: this is a watch face for Android Wear smart watches. Other smart watches like the Samsung Gear are running a whole different platform so this app can NOT be installed on those devices. Furthermore, it is unfortunately technically not possible to make this a home screen widget with the same smooth animations as the watch face. Otherwise we would've made that too!This app is not affiliated with the Nationale Spoorwegen.",

        "I love it too!  I wanted to ask if it could be an Android widget too, but this was asked by the reviewer before me.  Makes me want to get an Android Wear Device just to be able to use this Watch Face.",
        "What a great app!  I'm using a Swiss railway clock as my analog clock widget for an android tablet.  Would love to use this instead.  I  particularly like the cool second hand - it's kinda mesmerizing.   Please think about developing an android version - I'm sure it would be a hit!",
        "Love it! Can this also be a widget?",
        "Like being from NS",
        "Great! I am a signaller on the UK railways. I always use an analogue watch face to keep trains to time.  I love the look and movement of this watch face. However, I can't use it at work because it does not display the date!  The real clocks may not show the date, but It would be great to have the option to have a date window. Five stars from me when a date option is included.  Also the hour and minute hand shadows appear to show the light source as the ground occasionally!",
        "I love it! I'm a real dutch-trains lover, so this watch face make it all clear in my watch! ^_^"

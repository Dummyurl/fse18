        "Problem - Sony SW3 Hi Stephane. The pressure and weather will not update no matter what i do. Please fix. Using CYYZ and CYKZ...No luck. Also, maybe have choice of red or blue hands on a white background with black indicators? Just a suggestion. Thanks!",
        "Really like this... But on my SW3 the date is slightly obscured by the 3 and the date could be a little bit larger. In my opinion the text box spoils the look of the watchface so please make it optional. Also the batter meter is a little bit too large as it covers the 6."

        "Not happy...yet I paid the Pro fee, installed app, but didn't see app transfer to my Gear or watchface category. Please help. Even uninstalled app and tried again. Nothing negative about your app, just need a little bit assistance. Will support anyone with a clever idea such as this...thanks for any help.",
        "Brother. Eat well by the end of the month. You forced my hand here to pay. It's so freaking cool. Thank you.",
        "Great You want it, you just do....",
        "Love it but wish there were more features. If you could add the ability to add/remove/edit the custom insults, that would be sooooo nice. That being said, this is still wonderful and I'd pay more if I could.",
        "OK, after loading the free version, I had to spring for the Pro version. I still love the concept: a watch face with attitude.   I'd give it five stars if there were a way to tone down the language a bit. I have to be careful who I show this to!"

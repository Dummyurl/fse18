        "This watch face has a lot of cool features with a lot of different color combinations and adjustments, and so far it has worked flawlessly even the heart rate displays as intended.",
        "I really like this watch face and customization options.",
        "Hi ,  I really like this watch face on my moto 360 sport , but only problem i am facing that it takes Steps data from Google fit & I dont have google fit on my  watch/phone.  I am using Moto Body app for fitness tracking , can anyone tell me how to change step data from google fit to moto body ?",
        "Nice looking, but it really kills the battery on my Moto 360 (2nd gen).  To clarify, I do not use the heart rate monitor and ambient mode is set to \"eco\".",
        "I absolutely love this watch face. Simple clean and looks great. Awesome functionality to boot. I just would request another Full Ambient Mode where it just displays the time (Ultra Eco).",
        "Love this watch face. I would have given it 5 stars but the weather widget no longer works since upgrading to wear 2.0.  When you click on the weather icon it just says 'unable to execute shortcut'.  I have tried the usual restart etc. Same on LG G watch r and urbane 2 LTE."

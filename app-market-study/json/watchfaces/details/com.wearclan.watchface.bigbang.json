        "Would pay for This watch face looks great on my urbane. The fact that this face is free makes it even better.                                    Edit: the ambient mode is difficult to read and with no option to disable it I'm changing my rating from 5 to 4 stars.",
        "Ok Ambient mode looks awesome but when the watch face is active it is way too cluttered. Would give 5 stars if there was a way to customize it especially since the temperature is always off by at least 20 degrees. Would also like to remove the numbers or at least make them smaller.",
        "Beautiful! I love this watch face! But do agree with others that the temperature indicator is incorrect. It should just be removed. I have a Nexus 6P, Android 7, and a Moto 360 1st Gen. I highly recommend it.",
        "Exactly the look I wanted But if the weather is wrong, it may as well not be there. App hasn't been updated on some time, so probably abandoned.",
        "Nice watchface on my Moto 360. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the weather does not report correctly on my Moto 360. Like someone else mentioned, the weather is off by about 20 degrees Farenheit.",
        "Mostly pretty good. This is a solid, basic watch face that displays all the information I would quickly want to access, however the weather display is either inaccurate or just plain incorrect, and the ambient/always-on mode is a bit TOO minimal for my tastes."

        "not going to android wear This is my fave of your faces but I can't get this to show up in android wear to put on my Moto 360 ( up to date). Updated system, fresh installed watch, went through your FAQ but nothing worked. PLEASE RESPOND, I'll change feedback if you can help. All other watch faces I tried work except this one. If you're updating I'll wait just let me know. thank you",
        "Bad data Awesome watchface, but weather data incorrect as always and no calendar events. Using Moto 360 1st gen with new HTC 10",
        "A little buggy I really like this watch face but it's a little buggy. The altitude randomly switches back and forth between being correct and showing &lt;500 while in the same location. Also, the calendar never shows my events and the app uses way too much RAM on the phone. Even my most resource intensive apps don't use the 120MB+ of RAM this app does. I'd give five stars if these are fixed."

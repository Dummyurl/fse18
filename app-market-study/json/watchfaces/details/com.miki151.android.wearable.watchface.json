        "Really nice simple design Although the dev only shows this on circular watches, if you zoom out the analogue hands it works really well on square faced watches as well.  Love it on my Zen watch 2",
        "No full colour ambient Would really like a full colour ambient display. Would look great in Huawei Watch in colour rather than black and white",
        "Love it There aren't too many watch faces that I love. This is one of them",
        "Great Good app and the best customer service support well worth buying",
        "No full color ambient Wish developer's would state this beforehand",
        "I had issues but the app. Is good"

        "Works fine and loving it. However still waiting for the \"interactive\" part to work. Mahalo nui! *FYI - Someone posted \"ORTE\" being read on their watch face but I'm seeing it as \"DATE\". *Update ***** Interactive screen works Terrific! 3/1, 3/12, ***4/30/2016 Still, since last update 'compass' doesn't rotate (animation) anymore. Any answers/suggestions? Cause this was my favorite watch face until the 'compass' no longer worked since 3/1. When 'compass' is checked it's in a frozen state so yeah. 02/16/2017 Compass in a frozen state. Any fixes for it? 05/07/17 If it doesn't work just let me know, what is so hard to reply?",
        "This watch face is beautiful, and has great features. But, the weather has not updated since 9-9-15. Even the Update Now button in the wear app won't change the temp from 80 and raining.  Update, had to factory rest my phone today, and now this watchface will not show up in the wear app, making it a pain to configure. Still looks great, but poor functionality.",
        "Really like this watch face, impressed with the level of customisation. I've had it on my watch almost constantly for the last 9 months.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the weather complication keeps getting stuck since updating to AW 2.0, I have to launch the app on my phone and force and update, it will then keep updating for a couple of hours before it stops again.",
        "So it looks fine, can't decide on a colour I like to be honest ...... But the dimmed screen looks rubbish, iv got all info showing and it goes off centre, so looks really tacky. The compass points around the watch end up cut off at sides or top or bottom .... Hope an update will solve",
        "Doesn't appear to be compatible with Android Wear 2 as it doesn't show as a watch face after installation, not on the watch either. I have a LG G Watch R which is on the compatible list.",
        "Phone battery info stuck on 71%. Android os 7.0 Wear os 2.0  *update* Restart on both ends fixed the issue. Best watchface."

        "One of my favourite watch faces to use on a daily basis. The reason I gave 4 stars is that it seems to have some small issues. If there are no calls or texts it doesn't make sense opening the popup. For the stopwatch I get an empty laps list which makes that functionality rather useless. This would be a bonus, but adding a color picker for to create or edit themes would be really nice. Another bonus would be to have the number of the steps at the end of the blue bar giving that that space is not really used for anything. Great jobs guys, another watch face well worth the money.",
        "Was working well for a week. Now the calender mode has stuck on yesterday's agenda.  The steps are inaccurate compared to google fit. Nice design ..please sort the bugs",
        "Looks good I've just installed this watchface on my Huawei watch, it looks really good there some changes you can do right from the watchface. My question is, is there supposed to be an app on my phone where I can make changes. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
        "SMS Notification Broken With last update SMS will not update. New SMS not being shown. Deleted SMS still visible.",
        "Kept crashing Never worked... Just kept crashing every 10 sec",
        "Overall look is really nice but the steps and watch/phone battery indicaotrs aren't working.  Fully charged both devices and watch shows 80% for phone and 90% for watch."

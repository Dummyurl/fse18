        "have used this for a few months on my Moto 360 with no complaints, except I would like new faces added. these are getting a little stale for me. please work on adding more. that's why i paid for the app in the first place.  UPDATE: lowered my original rating because i still have not seen any updated faces. i paid the full amount to have all the faces and have seen nothing. these are great faces and look nice but stick with the basic faces and don't waste your money.",
        "Awesome! Very cool watch faces! These are what all faces should strive to be. Simple, elegant, with a little movement to add a nice touch. There is one problem I have found on my moto 360: the time is not centered horizontally on the face; it's off to the right. Fix this, and this is an easy 5 stars!!",
        "P. Arthur Worked great for my smart watch. Try it, the only thing is that there should be a larger amount of new faces.  My friend is into flowers a lot, if you put more of those I know she will download it..     Thank you.",
        "I have a ladies Huawei and it works beautifully! I chose Moto 360 as the watch type. While time isn't centered, I'm not sure it was intended to be as it would block the image? Thanks for such a lovely app. I'd love to see more themes from you such as a hummingbird in flight ;)",
        "Huawei... I got played buying premium.. Got NOTHING for it. First, this app does indeed work with the Huawei watch. Which is a good thing. It's set to the Moto 360 setting since Huawei isn't an option. Second, I purchase premium and got no additional content. The content is exactly the same as the free version. I feel like I got played for that. Where are the fall and winter themes?",
        "The faces they have are nice but I wish I would have read the reviews before trying to upgrade to \"premium\". You don't get anything different than the free version . This developer should be confronted by Google about this!"

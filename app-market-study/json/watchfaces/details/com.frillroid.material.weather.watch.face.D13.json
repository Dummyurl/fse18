        "Lovely designed watch face. Beautiful on Smartwatch 3, wish I could change from km/h to mph though. For those complaining about it wanting you to purchase again, have you selected this face and not the free version? Worked fine for me.",
        "Not working on moto 360 Will revise after its fixed. Even though I paid for the full version, it did not unlock the promised features. It acts like it's not installed.",
        "Can't change anything.. I just bought it, but are still not able to change anything. It just tells me to buy it again.",
        "Premium features not working Even after paying for the premium edition the additional features do not work on my rooted Gear 2 with android wear ROM.  Disappointed.",
        "Accountant Bought this app ; dosen't work ; says buy again. Don't google apps work anymore.",

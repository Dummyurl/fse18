        "After payment and reboots watch still asks for premium payment. This has been commented by others. Weather also always does location cannot be detected event if set manually. If i set secondary time zone only that gets displayed and can't find how you toggle between primary and secondary time zones. If i could if get refund but unable to via play store.",
        "So far this is awesome. There are 2 small things annoying me: 1. If you've paid for Premium it should remove the \"Obtain Premium Access\" option from the menu on the watch completely. It must go away. 2. For some reason the weather widget on the watch won't show the temp, it just draws 2 dashes, even if I set the weather location manually and disable GPS. Other than that, outstanding app.",
        "Good app, really like the look and features. Tried others before and some slowed down the watch but happy with this one. Only issue I had was the missed call widget got stuck on 2 missed calls and even after clearing them on phone it wouldn't go back to 0 so had to delete them from call history",
        "This watch face is awesome. The only thing is wish I could change the background to a custom picture. Other then that it's perfect still 5 stars all day!",
        "Amazing layout. I love the customization. Couldn't figure out how to fully customize some of the buttons using complication 2.0. Wrote the app developer an email and he responded the next day.",
        "Does just what it says.  Custom widgets and shortcuts make the watch a lot better.  And the designer answered my question. In about FIVE MINUTES.  Can't beat that for service."

        "Great - except for temps displayed in Kelvin as in another review, and data sometimes blanks. This is on an Asus Zenwatch 2.",
        "Great Has so much information on the screen it's amazing. Sun rise/set, barometer, wind speed/direction humidity, phone/watch battery life info is in addition to the time. Automatic location update is cool but it does not update the time when traveling between time zones (have to select another watch face and then reselect this one). Still it's the only watch face I need.",
        "Info disappears Would give 5 stars but weather info will disappear after about 10 minutes ever since Marshmallow was installed. Please fix.",
        "Nexus 6p Android 6.0 The weather info and all other details won't show up...same problem with your other faces... Use to work using my Samsung s4... Please help",
        "my favourite.. but.. why does the weather along the top, the humidity, wind speed and wind direction randomly disappear now and again? Also, it would be nice to have the current temperature displayed separately, I.e instead of the barometer that I do not require, can you make it so we can swap these? fix these two elements and ill change my rating to 5stars :)",
        "Nice watch face, Just big enough text for my old eyes.. I can only get black on green or white on black... where's the green on black? Edit: found it . set to black and white , then select the colour in the next setting."

        "Amazing! This is truly an amazing and creative watch piece! I love the blend of digital and regular watch faces. The gears move and are quite mesmerizing. There are so many options for customizations that anything is truly possible. Easy to read. HD. Feature rich without being bogged down. Beautiful styling and ingenuity. This is a must-have for ANY android wear owner!",
        "It's OK but needs to be improved. The \"circle\" needs to take up more of the screen. The numbers look too small. Also I wish I could add app shortcuts. This developer needs to just make an app where you can create your own but instead he charges $1 or more for these watch faces that can't be edited.",
        "Looks Great Great looking watch face, enhances the look of watch. No noticeable bugs or glitches. Overall very happy.",
        "Love it!  Has everything on the watch that I need. Lot the gear movements!",
        "Great! Probably my new favorite smart waych face.",
        "Nice watch face A nice professional looking watch face. Analogue and digital."

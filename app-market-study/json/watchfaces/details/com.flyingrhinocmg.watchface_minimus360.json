He walked me through the troubleshooting and I got the watch face working in no time. It's very customizable and I love it! Exactly what I was looking for",
        "Getting worse with each update Each iteration of updates is making this watch face worse. So much more bugs now. Watch face doesn't load after watch has restarted/powered back on. Glitches with the colour scheme from time to time and battery life of the watch is now worse than before..",
        "Won't load the custom preset I had made. So I'm stuck with the basic one.",
        "Nice face Worked for 24 hours, but now it doesn't count steps.  Annoying.",
        "No way to access settings on ticwatch E...I'm stuck with the basic face. Could you please help me out",
        "Great but doesn't change colors The presets aren't applied for some reason. If anyone knows how to get it working please let me know."

        "Love the Watch Face, small complaint though I really like this watch face, it's very simplistic and looks great! My only two complains are that it doesn't come in 12 hr format, and that it doesn't display the date. The second isn't the end of the world, it's just something nice to have.",
        "Was displaying wrong time which other watch faces didn't. Once it even showed the time as 16:68. There isn't 68 minutes in an hour.",
        "Looks great. Missing features. Add 12hr time please.",
        "Pretty watch face but... It needs a 12 hour option",
        "Need 12h 12h please. How do I change the background?",
        "Nice Very nice. Date would make it perfect."

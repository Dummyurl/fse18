        "Nice app some flags are wrong Dear developer please give me your email to send you the correct flag for Venezuela. Currently it has the Chinese flag although they own us we still have our own flag LMAO",
        "Great little app but Wrong flag Great little watch face app. The Welsh flag is wrong. It shows the flag of the UK. Please fix before next round of Euro 2016 ðŸ˜ƒ",
        "Wrong flags for some countries like Uzbekistan. Also Colorado is not a country, it's a state. Are there supposed to be other states on the list?",
        "Looks and Works Great! This app does what or says and looks good doing it. Download, set it on your watch, then change the country and style in the android wear settings. Easy. One request; the flag for Scotland is weathered green in the upper left hand side. The Scottish flag has an all blue background and while I know this was done for an artistic grunge style, it doesn't really read true. Keeping it all blue (and grungy) would make this Scotsman happy! Love the app!",
        "I don't know how to change the flag There is no app icon on my phone,there is no way to change the flag."

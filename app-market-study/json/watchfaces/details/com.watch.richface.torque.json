        "Excellent watch face I've been looking for this watch face for years. I love the idea of having digital/analog on the same screen. it's extremely stylish with all the regular perks that you get for having a smart watch, like weather, Footsteps, battery ect. On top of that if you don't like the color you can change it. In that regard it's like getting 5 watch faces for the price of one because I can change the colors for everyday of the week.  My  beef is that I can never get back to the default color it's my fav. watch face.",
        "Nice Watch Face..... But! Good looking watch face... But does not link to Google Fit? for that it is disappointing, please give us the option",
        "Great watch face but does not work with Android Wear 2.0. Cannot get it to show up to apply. Disappointing.",
        "My New Favourite watchface! You guys make the best watch faces and this one is no exception! The only thing I wish it had was a locking feature so I don't keep accidentally changing the face colour after making my own custom colour, and also the option to save custom color settings would be great. Thanks and keep up the good work!",
        "Love it I keep trying other watcg faces, but always end up going back to this one. It has everything I need and it is fully customizable!  Best watch face in the android market!",
        "I downloaded the app and I did  show up on my watch like the military digital one did"

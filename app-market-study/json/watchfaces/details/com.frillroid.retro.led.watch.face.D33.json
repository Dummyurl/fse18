        "Does not sync with phone I purchased the pro version because the free one made it seem like I needed to in order to get it to sync with my phone.  But it still keeps popping up with a message to sync but will not actually sync and the info on the watch face is wrong.  I love the way it looks but it does not work so I would like to be refunded my $ or have it fixed.  No response, no refund, still now working.  Too bad, this would be my favorite if it worked.",
        "Not Understanding... Why is the setting screen still Prompting me to buy the full version...after I've ALREADY PAID FOR IT!!!!! come on guys, do you realize how much watchface competition you have out here? You've got to step up, man...Refund, please...",
        "Buggy & Missing features Some of the layout issues fixed but still no weather option and the face annoyingly makes my phone show a notification to sync data to the watch every few minutes. Uninstalling, again.",
        "failed execution Keep getting hit with purchase the pro version requests, the face rarely updates, no functionality increase when you purchase the face since it doesn't acknowledge you own it. Massive battery drain",
        "Purchased pro version in order to use full functions because I love the watchface. But it still prompts to purchase pro every time. Other reviews state the same issue. Asked to refund.",
        "Battery killer Looks cool but is killing my battery. I usually get a full 2 days but with this face ill be lucky to get 5 hours. Very disappointed"

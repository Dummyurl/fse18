        "Use this daily along with Integrated Timer. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the annoying crashes that happen, but that also happens with Ingress itself at a higher frequency.",
        "Unwanted error message Used to be my favorite watch face, but touching the screen now brings up an error message about how \"android wear support is a new feature available to donators only.\" I don't even want the android wear support enabled. Please allow users to disable this! I even payed for the extension to allow custom logos already!",
        "Awesome. Love this watch face. Have tried many faces and this is always my first choice. Is there a way to disable the active points on the face. I keep launching the Ingress app on my watch by accident.",
        "Great time widget Don't have an Android wear watch but I use it for the widget. No better watch widget for an Ingress player.",
        "Settings? The settings option seems to have disappeared. You can't change the watch face from the default view.",
        "Not an android app This is a watchface for a smartwatch running the Android Wear os...don't have one myself but still looks cool."

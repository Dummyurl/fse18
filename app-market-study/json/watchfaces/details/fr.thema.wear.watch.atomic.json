        "Really enjoy the design scheme of the watch face and appreciate that it displays enough information on screen without being cumbersome. Choosing which apps or widgets I want to access through touchable icons is a nice feature. And a shout-out to the developer for responding to my email on a question I had in a timely manner. Really appreciate that.",
        "yeah",
        "The smooth animation with the moving bars is nowhere to be found on my ZenWatch 3. Not sure what type of watch is used to make the video, but it sure as hell doesn't look like that in real life!",
        "All interactive sections work very well and the face looks great. Just wish this could save different colour schemes like I can do on the Octane watch face from the same maker. Please consider adding this feature as I have purchased a few watch faces from you now and this is a great feature to have, as I use this one and Octane face every day. Keep up the good work.",
        "Why can't I open the mobile app to edit the colors? It's only possible via the watch and it's very time consuming. The mobile app can't be opened at all, only \"Uninstall\" option is available.",
        "Looks and runs great."

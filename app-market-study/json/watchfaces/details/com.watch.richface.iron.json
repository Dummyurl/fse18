        "Good design but fix/stop the colour tap This is a good design, I like the interactive weather and showing the two battery levels. Despite the interactive setting being turned off, it still changes the color when I tap at the bottom... It also doesn't obey the option to not show taps... that setting is also off yet I still see the circle where I tap.",
        "Was fantastic until last update This was my go to face, but the recent android wear up date now causes the watch face to momentarily go back one color then reset to the colors I have chosen. Its a small thing but incredibly annoying. Please fix this and I will restore my 5 star review.",
        "Nice but with major flaws Color changes on tap need to have an option to disable. You set a color with no way to save it and then it's gone by an accidental tap. Time in ambient mode falls behind sometime up to three minutes before catching up. It's not worth even being there if the time is incorrect. Only watch face I've ever seen do this.",
        "Huawei watch Really do like this and will be my go-to face. Only criticism is that there needs to be a disable for the touch to change colour and a screen dim setting for ambient mode. If that was implemented then 5 stars for sure.",
        "Get rid of color change on tap Looks great but what is this crap with color change on tap? Totally ruins it. Why have a crazy color customizer when you can't even keep it? Would rate 5 otherwise.",
        "Asus Zen Watch My smart watch is the very first one I've owned and I'm glad I found one of many faces for my zen watch. I really like the functionality of this face.it doesn't throttle down my watch when I use it. I'm very happy with it. I hope they keep up the good work because making an app for smart watches or phones even is a hard thing to do. Believe me I've made a few apps myself for personal use designed specifically for my rooted HTC one m8. Keep up the good work and thank you for such a great app for my watch. :)"

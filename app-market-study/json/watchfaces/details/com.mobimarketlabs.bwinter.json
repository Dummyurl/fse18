        "Nice concept, but design points are off.  The watch face uses two different shades of yellow/gold that look terrible together and there is no option for 24 hour time or much customization for a paid app.  Don't buy this face until it is optimized.  Also, as a side note, the English directions and prompts in the settings are hilariously erroneous.  On a Huawei 2 and TH Connected watches, I haven't observed any crashes or instabilities like others have noticed.",
        "Nice design and good concept let down by poor stability. Every so often it will mess up and the watch will revert to the Basic watch face. The weather seems to be the main culprit, but now I can't turn it off. I've been through uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing cache, resyncing etc several times with no pattern to what will get it working again (temporarily).",
        "Very disappointed, give all permissions and watch face crashes always. Not recommend to anybody. Don't buy it is a waste of your money",
        "No solid black background and no full and bient mode. Missing hour markers... Such a disappointment‼️ The free version was so beautiful now junk. Even missing full ambient mode, no hour markers. Such a loss this was the most beautiful",
        "Battery Hog. I'm an HTC 10 user. Design and functionality appears to be a good build but just can't get past the battery drain to test.  I would not recommend this watch if you are concerned with battery life.",
        "All great except second time zone. Main face on local time (with daylight saving) and second time zone is 1 hour short. No good for travel."

        "Great watch face. Really love how simple the design is and the use of colour. I only wish I could exclude some of the colours from the random colour option.",
        "Card size is a bit big covering part of the time, but apart from that the face is good. Simple but eye catching, and functional.",
        "Good Face Perfect but just need black or dark grey colour almost black",
        "Great Watch Face Only thing is that the 12 hour time (am/pm indication) is wrong. Please fix!",
        "Unique Wouldn't mind proper colour control rather than leaving it purely to chance",
        "Really nice I feel like it deserves 5 stars simply because of elegance and simplicity. Nice work."

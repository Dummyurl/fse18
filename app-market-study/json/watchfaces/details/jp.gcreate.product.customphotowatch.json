        "Won't let me edit the photo or anything",

        "You've done a terrific job with this - Better then Moto 360 stock customization app - you've added the bonus of Color Time and date AND font size!  Now even able to move time location so it doesn't block the pics. Keep up the great work - love the color/font options! I'm backðŸ˜„! Now I've got My Pics, with My Color digital time and font in the Size I want; and date is just as customizable. Having Color options and size choice is a must when using custom photos -and stock only allows b/w which of course didn't work with all photos. With this Custom Watch Face app the digital clock can be tiny so as not ruin a back ground pic or enlarged and moved L/R, U/D. You're the best!"

        "Awesome! How do you go into night mode? (green neon numbers). I've only seen it change when setting my watch on the charger. I don't know of there's a setting or something I'm missing..",
        "It's a great app, but... Every few hours, the screen goes blank and I have to restart the watch for it to show the face. I've tried resending it from the phone app, but it is still a black screen until restart. Also sometimes it changes to a plan Moto watch face and I have to change it back. Also, when it goes to dim, part of the hands and middle aren't visible. How can I resolve all of the above?",
        "Wrong date Nice face but date is wrong; today is Sept 18th and it shows 1 18.",
        "Amazing A great piece of art and a watch face maker that does it right with great ambient faces as well- thank you",
        "Does not work. Does not show up in my watch faces. Shame it looked good.",
        "MIA Does not show up in my watch list so I can't use it had to uninstall"

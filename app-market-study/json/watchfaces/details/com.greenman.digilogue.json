        "Prevents burn in Just switched from G Watch to the G Watch R and i have to say temporary burn in was an issue with stock watch faces. Switched to this watch face and never switched to others. Perhaps on the next update, the size of the analogue line to be different when on and ambient mode? Thicker when on and thin on ambient would be useful",
        "Didn't show up Downloaded but could never find the face. EDIT: I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it works fine. Just the watch face I wanted",

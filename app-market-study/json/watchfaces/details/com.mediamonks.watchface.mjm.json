        "Update: I found the way to change the stones, but it was not intuitive. Some instructions would he been nice. For those who don't know, you can change the stones within the watch by going into your settings, change watch face, and there you will see the settings gear. So, as promised, my rating has increased from two stars.  Original: Have been waiting for the stone to change, but it doesn't. I cannot find a way to change it either. Once those are fixed, the rating will go up.",
        "These faces are so beautiful, but I wish there was an option to turn off the clock flipping to the rock story. I don't need to accidentally read it every time I touch my watch. It'd also be great if we could add some customization, like seeing the weather, or # steps, or # of notifications.",
        "Beautiful watch faces overall, though a couple are out of focus. Still love.",
        "Beautiful watch face, but I really want to be able to customize the hands and tick marks. Any ways I can do that? Instructions would have been great.",
        "The hands weren't interesting enough",

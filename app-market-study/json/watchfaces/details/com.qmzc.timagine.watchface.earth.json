        "Phone battery indicator doesn't work. Love it, but the indicator for the phone battery doesn't work. I have have tried resynching and rebooting. I would give it 5 stars if this were to be fixed. Moto 360 and S7.",
        "Beautiful and unique. The phone battery indicator however does not work. Not sure what the steps indicator is supposed to show, I don't see anything on the watch change or add anything when switching to it.",
        "It's pretty and I'd love to try it, but it needs a proper ambient mode.",
        "Very cute Needs 24 hour clock. All watch faces should have a 24 hour option",

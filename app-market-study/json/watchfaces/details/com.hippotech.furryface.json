    "description": "This is both a live wallpaper for your mobile or tablet, and a watch face for your smart watch. Your chosen FurryFace changes mood depending on the current state of your device's battery status. It's very happy when the battery is fully charged, but becomes more confused, grumpy and tired as the battery life decreases. Choose between the panda, the pig, the seal, the cat or the dog, and follow its different moods during the day. Maybe you will even share some feelings. To make sure that FurryFace won't make any impact on your battery life, no animations or other battery consuming functions are being used.If you encounter any problems, please send an email to hanell.jenny@gmail.com. Also, feel free to suggest future functions and new animals to the app! ♥﻿",

        "Nice wallpaper. Sadly I have to stick with the watermarked dog. I like the panda but, it seemed so bright but oh well. It's be great if the watch face idle screen was used as an additional feature involving daydream. It's like looking over and watching it sleep...or something like that.",

        "Wish it all (or at least some) features would work Looks great. Note 4. Marmallow. Moto 360 (2). All permissions on. No heart rate, no working weather, colors change, and analog/digital changes. Let me know when the rest gets working. I would love to have this as my everyday face.",
        "Has potential... Update - in addition to the other issues, I had to uninstall the app as it was draining battery power on the phone (LG G4) to the tune of 25% and would not let me simply \"stop\" it. Heart rate monitor does not work on moto 360 2nd gen. Also aren't the buttons on the outside supposed to be active? I tap them and nothing happens.",
        "Don't install, will murder your phone battery Two days after install and it's consistently number 2 on the list of highest power consuming apps, and my phone no longer makes it past 6pm without charging when before it would last the full day. Avoid.",
        "Looking forward to more I love the layout! I wish options included Hangouts, Glide, Compass, Google Fit Goal/Steps, Swarm, Dialer... basically if it could allow for custom shortcuts to apps/functions on the watch... not on the phone.",
        "Hmmm. Started getting ads on my phone for CallsApp! sponsored from this watch face app. Update: It's good news to hear that this won't be happening anymore, thanks.",
        "Battery Killer Used more battery than my anything else on my phone."

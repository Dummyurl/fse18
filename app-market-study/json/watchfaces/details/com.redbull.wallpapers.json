        "Love the wallpapers and use it on both my phone and tablet. The daily auto change of wallpaper doesn't work on either my Moto G4 or Samsung galaxy tab s2. Nor did it on my previous tab and phone. It's my only problem with the app so I figured 4* until it does as it states. Thanks anyway.",
        "Always stops working The app always stops working on my moto 360 2nd gen. It happen every time when ever i try to set it as my watch's face. I am using the latest version of Android on my watch.",
        "The wallpapers are cool but.... They are nice but the wallpapers do not fit in the centre of my display even if I use single screen on my display and kept the the scroll wallpaper option off. Maybe they just don't want to fit in the centre of my screen.😅",
        "Not working in moto360 This app used to support my moto360 smart watch and after the last update it doesn't support it anymore. Please fix the bug. I really like the wallpapers but I want it in my smart watch again.",
        "Keeps crashing on my zenwatch 2 I think it has support for only round watch faces..please resolve this issue",
        "Watch face crash! The watch face keeps crashing on wearables. Every time i pair the watch, i see crash notifications. I couldnt even use the watch without uninstalling this app!"

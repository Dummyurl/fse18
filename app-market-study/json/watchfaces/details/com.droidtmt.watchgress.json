        "UPDATE: Keeps getting better. The dev actually updates the watchface, adding more features and icons, really love the latest one ;) keep em coming! Could do with adding those new Wear 2.0 features like adding shortcuts to other apps etc.  Watch face didn't appear in list for Wear 2.0, had to go to Google Play on my watch  and actually install the app via the watch for it to appear. The dev was amazing at helping! 5 stars!",

        "Almost perfect. The developer(s) need better curating. It's not that the art choice is bad, I've actually enjoyed that. However the quality of certain works is too pixelated for today's screens. Please consider only using higher resolution images",
        "Used to work great. Now it has trouble changing wallpapers on its own. I've had this problem with multiple phones. It'll work if I change to wifi only, and then stop working. And then if I change it to not wifi only, it'll work for a bit and then stop. Wish it would work all the time.",
        "It's gone back to getting stuck on one wallpaper and only showing half of it. I have to change sources, restart my phone to sometimes get it to work again. I use this app with backdrops.",
        "First app I put on all my devices. Beautiful. The lastest update is great. The only thing that would make this perfect for me at least it's to add an option to stop wallpaper scrolling. I know some custom launchers do this but I actually prefer stock. Thanks for your hard work.",
        "Love the app but most of the time it doesn't change the wallpaper as scheduled on my S6 Edge which is really annoying, even when I go into the app and press the next arrow a lot of the time the wallpaper won't change. I have uninstalled/re-installed and cleared the cache etc with no success, it works perfectly on my Pixel C tablet so must be an issue with my phone which is running Nova launcher btw. Other than that I think its one of the best wallpaper apps out there.",
        "Coming back to this app after 3 years only to find that you still haven't given us an option to resize or adjust the wallpapers to our screens! It's not even scrollable! Beautiful app but it's all a waste if it won't fit our screens!"

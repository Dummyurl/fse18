        "Stopped working all of a sudden This was a nice feature untill it stopped working. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still does not work. This is not worth it if it stops working. This was on the note edge. I will change this review once this problem is repaired. Also very hard to contact the programmer to let them know about this problem because i do not use facebook.",
        "Nice Just what I've been looking for. Now please make some similar ones so I can switch it up. Something more like Stuhrling watches.",

        "Love the watch face, nice and, minimalistic with plenty of customization. There are a few bugs where after looking at a notificationl it doesn't display the correct time and mode for passive mode, this is fixed by going into active mode and letting it transition back into passive mode, hope they will iron that out though. Also, wish I could remove the spin transition hand and just have the second hand fade in in active mode. Favorite watch face thus far though.",
        "Pretty cool but ambient mode is weak. Update: never got that update as of 4/16... I really like it, though. There's a decent set of options in regards to color. The transition animation is very smooth and looks great. However, the ambient mode watch face is pretty lame compared to the active mode. Please add some additional options.",
        "Hard to tell time I like the way the watch face looks with the cool animations, and all the different options as well. What it really needs is an option for hours markers though, because in its current state it is hard to actually tell the time, which kinda defeats the purpose of a watch",
        "great for moto 360. haven't kept a non-stock watch face on my watch for this long since i purchased it six months ago.  minimal, material, and perfect.",
        "Great watch face.. This should be included by default on every watch and the developer could get a royalty for it. Also the first face that has customizations right through the watch itself instead of through the phone app. Great work and beautiful!",
        "Close to perfect! Awesome  watch face. will definitely give 5 stars when there's  an option to show the time in number form an this will be one of my permanent watch faces. Please add the digital time feature, pleeease devs!!!!"

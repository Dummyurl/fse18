        "I love the appearance of this watchface, but things just don't work no matter your setting. Peak and translucent cards don't work. Notifications only work sometimes. Tapping the center changes the color scheme, and you lose those settings. Maybe it'll get some bug fixes in the future.",
        "Really great watchface, love all the details it gives effectively, clearly, and neatly.  One major issue I have is that if you allow interactivity and touch the digital clock then you lose your custom colors and it cycles through presets. This is really annoying, and the only way to avoid it is to completely turn off interactivity and that stops a lot of other features. I really wish there was just a setting to turn that off.",
        "I have Pixel XL phone and the Find My Phone on my Huawei watch worked at first then didn't and the worked for one day then not. My husband has this app on his Huawei watch with a Moto g Force or something like that and his Find  My Phone never faltered working.      .......Also the temperature doesn't seem to change on watch unless I update on phone first.",
        "Love all the rich face watches but uninstalled them all, even my paid ones because I don't need to be reminded every 15 minutes when an update occurs!",
        "Been Harrassed all day with sale messages. I've uninstalled all of your watch faces and you can shove it.",

        "Was ok until I found out that I needed to use the companion app. Now that I have done this, not the premium, I can no longer change the face colours by tapping on then screen. It was happily lettinge do this before connecting the companion app. Also there are no screen taps showing at all on the screen, as though it is no longer interactive. The screen lock is still showing unlocked, it has never worked!",
        "Hi looks like a neat watch face, but how do u get the digital clock and day and calendar in the middle? When I hit stopwatch, those things disappeared and can't seem to get them back.",
        "The watch is great until you do something interactive and then randomly nothing works at all after that. Only way I've found to fix it is to reinstall which is a pain. Restarting didn't resolve the issue. Would have been 5 star otherwise.  (update: there is a small lock icon at the bottom which is used to lock the watch face and I had not noticed it... 5 starts now!)",
        "DONT USE THIS APP!  This app in the paid version crashed my Moto360 and it hasn't worked since (foUr days so far) just a blank screen.  I emailed the developer but no response.   Google refunded my purchase.",
        "I love the app!! If you guys want me to rate 5 stars then please let it show steps",
        "5 stars for the last update, it is possible to disable now that annoying 'change color on tap' feature, thanks!"

        "Looks elegant and stylish. But heavily buggy and freezes all the time. Would've been better if the watch face can be customized from the watch itself. Moreover I never saw any customization page in the wear app that shows ads.",
        "Doesn't load to my watch and even though I bought the Pro version when I change it to green it stays red doesn't matter because can't get it to my watch says Color Mask has stopped wasn't worth the 1.01",
        "Crashes Never can set watch face because it crashes. 360 V2",
        "Meh... Not a single one setting in free app. Also, no time i  ambient mode, only seconds ring...",

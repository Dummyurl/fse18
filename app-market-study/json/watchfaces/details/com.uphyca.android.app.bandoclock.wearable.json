        "Love it!! Paid for it!! But now it feels abandoned... Thanks for the update but know I can't seem to find the settings to adjust the BOW faces within the Android Wear app. I'll have patience since hopefully it's being worked on now.",
        "Very application Not very cause its stock the pic that use..",
        "Doing nothing to my phone",
        "Great watch face! This is a great app.  I paid for it, not because I cared about changing the position or text color, but because it's worth the price of a ice cream cone, latte, soft drink, etc for the free version.  Would love it if you added ability to:  - change size (time and date independently)  - change font independently for date and time  - change text color independently for date and time(sometimes the image requires separate colors)  - select date format 'July 7' without the the day.   And for a stretch, not sure if it's feasible, but sending multiple watch faces to watch so that you could switch between them at will.  If this isn't possible, would be nice to save them on phone and resend saved ones at will.",
        "ABANDONED APP... no new features for paid version. App dead? Abandoned? This app has not been updated since July, 2014. It lacks many features that are now more common in other (free) Wear watch faces. Such a shame. It had great potential.",
        "Good but has two issues First issue: set it up and looked perfect at the time I put it together. 10:00 comes around and the last 0 falls out of place. Minor as I as able to adjust it, but is hard unless it's currently that time. Second which is why I cannot use it, it was literally skipping minutes which didn't occur on any other watch face. It would stay on one minute for too long then quickzily pass the next one to the proper time.                Edit: apparently it's my watch skipping minutes as I caught it doing on another fac"

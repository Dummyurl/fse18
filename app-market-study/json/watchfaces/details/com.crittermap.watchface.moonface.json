        "love the idea but needs more style I love this faces idea but it needs more unique style firstly I would like to see a minimal or simplistic design, secondly I would like to see the moon rise/set to have an option for non-military time setting,lastly I would like to see the background change with the time of day instead of every time you look at the face otherwise its an interesting idea that is rather soild that just needs some more style to make it stand out better",

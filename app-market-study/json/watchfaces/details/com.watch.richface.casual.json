        "The best This is my daily watchface. Looked great on my LG Urbane....and looks even better on my Huewai W1 ....simply the best. I have read the negative comments and have to disagree. In my experience having used the watchface for a few months, the weather works perfectly in London UK; I like simple hands and the peek card sits perfectly under the digital display on my Huewai.  5 stars.",
        "LAZY Another crap, lazy watch. Could be good if care went into the hands and instead of telling me the same time twice allowed me to set up the digital myself to a timezone. No problem in LUA. Waste of an opportunity. Money back. Change and I'll pay again.",
        "FINALLY!!!! A watch face that is clean, classy, full featured and has everything I've been looking for! Perfection!  Only hiccup I've found is that when the watch goes out of range of the phone, the icon that pops up displays on top of the day/date. Other than that I love this face!  Good job guys!",
        "Bad weather details The weather never updates so it should have an option to display or not display the weather.  It shows 31 deg and has done so since it was installed. Perhaps the ability to select location may assist.  Rest is good but let down by this",
        "Ok, but a few bugs Weather definitely not working, whichever weather source or refresh time you choose. Please fix this, since its one of the main face features. Using on Moto 360 2nd gen",
        "Everything you need in a watch face Best watch face out, both anolog and  the digit time displays, watch and battery displays, smooth, sleek design.                                                      Only downfall is the phone battery percentage goes out of sync now and then.  Running a Huawei watch, other then that great all round and best designed watch face."

        "I'm not so impressed about it. If I wanted to know other Gmail app I would have stayed with them. The only thing upsetting is I can't get this thing out of my tablet! Every time I go to set up another email app this thing keeps on coming up like a virus! I'm very upset with this! Now all I have to do is my homework, and then I can get rid of this silly app once and for all! I don't advise using this!",
        "They've made a big mistake with the latest update!! They've changed it to group by time (days, months), and it has ruined it!! No option to turn it off either. Please give and option to turn it off! Means my inbox is much bigger (and less manageable)  than before. Hate it! Considering moving onto another app.",
        "App will sync your emails sometimes only after restarting it. It will never let me download attachments and most of the time sent emails will just sit in the outbox without sending. Almost useless.",
        "Often will not sync the inbox, even after pulling down, just loads forever. No calendar month view. Can't sync calendar with Android system as old app allowed. Calendar colors completely unstable and do not match OWA, W10 Mail app or Outlook. Can't select folders to sync, can't select amount of mail to sync. Inbox is slow to update or does not update when notifications for new mail display, therefore you can not read the new mail. No Group calendar support.",
        "No search in calendar, no email count notification on icon, contact view needs a right edge abcdef.... for faster scrolling as the search of contacts is too slow.  Does integrate with Cortana.   Guess MS will get it right in a few more iterations.  Right now it is poor beta software.",
        "The latest update is terrible, it now groups email by dates which makes the inbox far bigger than it should. I turn this off on my desktop view, why would I want it on my phone! At least give us the option to turn it off"

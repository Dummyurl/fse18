        "Awesome watch face.After difficulties with installation it works perfectly on Casio WSD-F20...UPDATE: experiencing the same issues as Anirban.No data sync for 2 weeks.Watch face is still installed but disappeared invisible and no access...",
        "Great but... EDITED: Moto 360 v2. This is my current favourite watch face but is let down by higher than expected battery use compared to similar faces. Device has provided some settings tweaks to improve things but is still below expectations. I love this face but I wish it just worked a bit better. Keep up the great work.",
        "Great work. Keep it up!!  1. The mobile app is beginning to stop randomly. This affects the data sync with the wAtch face on my Smartwatch3. Mobile OS: 7.0 Nougat, mobile Z5 PD.  Can you stabilize the mobile app?  2. Request to add the \"weather\" as a widget option on the watch face along with steps and 2nd time zone.",

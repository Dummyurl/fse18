        "Looks great with defaults.  Hope you like them because none of the options \"available\" work on the free version.  Ambient mode doesn't change, no matter what you set it at.  Makes me not want to try the pay version because I'm afraid of the same issues.",
        "I have a problem with Android Wear 2, I can't see the watchface in the smart watch. Any suggestion?",
        "Love the simplicity but they are dishonest in that what they tell you you can do with edits, you cannot do. So I will uninstall and give poor ratings until it is fixed.",
        "Nice looking watch face but no matter how I set the ambient mode in the app, it doesn't change on the watch. It only displays the default bient mode regardless of how the app is set.",
        "I can't customize this at all. The changes done in phone never reflect on watch. Using pixel 2xl and Huawei 2classic",
        "Nice looking watch face. Love the uncluttered look.can we get the option of displaying the phone battery instead of watch battery?"

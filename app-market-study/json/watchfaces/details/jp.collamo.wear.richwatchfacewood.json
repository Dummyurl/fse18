        "Mildly Disappointing It crashes every time I try to go into settings. I can choose different watch faces, but I have a feeling there are additional settings (such as the secondary time zone) that I can't access. Otherwise, good looking faces.",
        "Best watch face for me Elegant. Simple. Beautiful. Functional.  I'm happy to compromise on battery life to keep it always on! It's actually quite battery friendly even if kept always on.  Dim mode looks really cool too in the dark.",
        "Can't see it Can't see it on my hauwai watch in the android wear app on my phone.",
        "Doesn't work properly Crashes when trying to access settings",
        "Constant crash. HTC ONE M9 Moto 360 V2.",
        "Love the Brown wood! Synced up easily, great looking faces especially the brown."

        "I cant find it because I'm stupid. Stupid people like me have not been catered for. I assume I need some kind of android watch to make it appear. Because it sure doesn't  show up on my Galaxy.  There should be a sign for fools and idiots such as me to explain this otherwise we are confused for anywhere up to an hour.",
        "World famous clock face on your wrist! I like this, it's a nice replication of the clock face on London's famous tower. My only gripe is it is a little feint in dimmed mode on my Sony Smartwatch 3. Otherwise it would be 5 stars from me!",
        "Jolly good job From a distance, where you can't tell it's Big Ben, it's just an awesome looking,  handsome watch fac",
        "cool nicely done. Now you need the chimes.",
        "Doesn't have enough information about the how to use the clock.",

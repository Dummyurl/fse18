    "description": "This watch face keeps it simple and minimal. Just some lines, circles and colors. It was designed as a round watch face, but can also adapt to square Android Wear devices. The watch face supports ambient mode and showing the date and markers.After installing Airli, you may have to wait a few minutes until the watch face is available on your Android Wear device. Watches which do not support full color ambient mode show a simple black and white representation of the watch face when switching to ambient mode. Also, your watch needs at least Android 5.1 for the watch face to work – please update if you use an earlier version.",

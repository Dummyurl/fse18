        "Nice watch face..... But It's too light. It looks more grayish than black. The indicators are not very accurate and even confusing.",
        "Doesn't work on Moto360 I have reset both my phone and watch multiple times, and resynced Wear Apps to watch but it is still not listed in my watch face list. Uninstalling.",
        "Disappointed Installed on moto 360 but it doesn't fill the face properly and looks like it's slipped from top to bottom!",
        "Resolution I have the new Urbane and this has to be the worst resolution WatchFace I've ever seen",
        "Just wow. Easily my new favorite watch face. Cant beat the look and the multiple dials.",
        "Ambient mode is terrible The watch face itself looks great and works well. But ambient mode is really boring and ugly."

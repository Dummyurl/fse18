        "Reinstalled (LG Urbane and moto 360).  Options only available through watch, not Android Wear!   Still crashes on both watches.  Other mml watch faces work better. And I don't like being told I don't know how to do something when it flat out DOESN'T WORK as described!  Android 4.4",
        "Although the look and style is great. The battery indicators do not update automatically unless you click in the phone app. Also the month calendar is not going to current month automatically.",
        "It's keeps say no permission to read calls or text on my phone it anoying even I quite like the watch face",
        "Great looking , but have a question when's is the interactive one coming it's been 12 months almost sine it came out shame your other watch faces have poor reviews they all work fine for me",
        "Wish to get a full or more features version. And wish at the ambient screen got a simple digital style with a calendar for all your products, thanks",

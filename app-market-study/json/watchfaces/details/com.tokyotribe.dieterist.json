        "A beautiful and simple watch face that actually looks like a watch face. Looks great on my LG Watch Style. No fuss and easy to read the time.",
        "6 gets cut off on 360 I'd be fine with the 6 being removed for moto 360 watches",
        "Looks great. Would be nice to have a Moto 360 specific face though that didn't cut off the 6 at the bottom. Maybe just move it up or remove it?",
        "Looks good.  Maybe add a small digital or day of the week",
        "Very elegant",
        "Good face Very nice but would be better if had more info on face like battery level"

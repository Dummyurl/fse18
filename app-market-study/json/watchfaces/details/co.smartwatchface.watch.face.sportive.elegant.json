        "Does nothing? Change items in Settings, but nothing changes the watchface.  Says it's now \"on wearable device,\" but not so. How difficult should it be to install a watchface?",
        "It's a very elegant watchface and I use it quite often. What upsets me is the weather complication. It does not work. I have the Asus ZW3 with Android 2.",
        "This is the best watch face I've found. Unfortunately, though, the reflective animation does not work on my ZTE Quartz. It would be really awesome if we could use a plain black background for active mode as well as ambient mode. Otherwise, it's on my watch all the time.",
        "It doesn't work with the Michael Kors smartwatch:(",
        "Very classy with Huawei smartwatch. Works perfectly with Android Wear 2.0. I have other watchface from the same Dev.....always top notch",
        "Beautiful and professional looking watch face. Well worth the money."

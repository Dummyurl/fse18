        "I can build better faves at watchmakers. Dont waist your money.",
        "Compass mode and phone battery not working on Huawei Watch. The compass scale appears but doesnt move. Phone battery level is always at 100%. Would be great if it has more features such as Steps counter, calories and weather... And maybe an option to hide the watch icon from the App Drawer. But I am still using it as I simply love the design!",
        "A bit touch up maybe? It's cool for sure but it looks a bit cluttered on LG Urbane because of the details on the edge... and I wish there's options to add glow effect to hour and minute hand. It's a bit hard to see sometimes with most details are overlapping in white colour as well",
        "I was really looking forward to seeing how this looke don my Moto 360. The idea is great and it's such a beautiful design for a watch but this face doesn't do it justice. It's almost there but the image doesn't seem to be sharp enough. The dullness actually makes it a little hard to tell the time, every time my watch lights up I actually strain my eyes a little trying to figure it out. I know it must be difficult with all the black, but the watch could benefit from some sort of shadow, make the hands a little more 3D",
        "Most stuff are fake Compass is fake \"W\"is always at 0900 and does not move. Batteries for phone and watch don't work. Timer for on/off can't be adjust. The only thing good about this watch is the look. But it is over price at $2 I kept it because I like the way it looks."

        "Installed on Samsung Gear Live, I'm able to customize colors, however any of the options on the watch face only activate the OK Google option.. I tried settings different options but none work.. Am I doing something wrong? Do I need to somehow disable the OK Google option for the options in the center of the watch face to work?",
        "Very nice watch face Love this watch face, my only gripe is that I wish the colour of the watchface itself (not just the hands, numbers and digital display background) could be changed from the dark brown it comes with.",
        "The watch face was always crashing. Couldn't even finish configuring or it crashed. And now I'm not even able to run it from scratch anymore",
        "Stability is a problem, but nice faces Stability seems to be big problem. I downloaded it for my Sony Smartwatch 3. It constantly lags and stops running. Ultimately it will restart the watch. The faces are really nice, but with the stability issues I will uninstall it. Good effort overall.",
        "Not very stable Considering I Paid money for this, I  feel that it's flaky and unstable nature has a lot to be desired. I have better free watch faces. Very dissapointed. Using on a LG Urbane.",
        "Crashed a lot Used with LG urbane crashed constantly, not sure why never had a watch app do this before.  Need updating badly."

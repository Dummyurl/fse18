        "Would be Better if at the top section would be smaller so that 2015 would fit with the date. Also if there was an AM and pm with the time then this would be 5 stars. Would also be cool if it would automatically change different  colors. Also if it display weather info",
        "Looks good but needs more options. Colour is the only option that we can change. It would be nice to be able to change various things about the time/date format. For example displaying the month as \"Aug\" instead of \"08\".",
        "Great watch face for my Android Wear. *Update:* woo-hoo. Thanks for the update for transferring the time to the middle. Won't be bothered anymore that card previews are blocking the time.",
        "Nice watch face but can't get into the setup on a Sony sw3 to change colors though, would make it a 5 if I could",
        "Ok. Would like to see the watch time alone have the ability to change to different color and I would 5 star it.",
        "Great app Easy to use and nice looking."

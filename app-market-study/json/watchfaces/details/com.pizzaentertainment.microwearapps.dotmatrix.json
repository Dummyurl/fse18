        "No Ambient Mode? I like this face for the most part. Its unique though a little difficult to read. My biggest complaint is there is no discernible time displayed in the ambient mode of my watch. What's the point if I don't even know the time?",
        "Great concept. Love the idea and concept but very difficult to view in ambient mode.",
        "Doesn't work on android wear 2",
        "Pretty good but it could use a step counter",
        "Needs improvement While the idea is nice the implementation needs some work. There needs to be a greater contrast between the background and the number digits. Without better contrast time is very difficult to read. Also passive screen is useless since background dots and number are all the same intensity.",
        "Passive screen is useless. On the Gear Live, the passive display still has the background dots. Eventually the dots used for the time are indistinguishable from the background dots."

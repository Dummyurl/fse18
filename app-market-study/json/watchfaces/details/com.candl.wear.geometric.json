        "One step away from being my default. Really, really like the look and feel of this watchface. Only thing I feel it is missing is custom backgrounds. The choices there are great, but having the ability to apply a custom background would be awesome! Maybe even different font options? Otherwise, works and feels great on my LG G Watch paired with my S6 edge!",
        "This watch face is not showing... This watch face is not showing on my Nexus 5 (OS 5.1) or Samsung Gear Live (OS 5.0.2).  I restarted the watch and phone, but with no luck.  I also uninstalled and then reinstalled the watch face and Android Wear apps, but that also did not help the issue.  I do like the watch face concept.  CAN I PLEASE GET A REFUND?",
        "Does not work It worked for a few seconds when I first installed it, but then gave me a force close and then just stays on a generic face. When I choose a different face, then go back to this one, it gives me 2 force closes, then goes back to that generic face. Please fix this problem. I would love to use it",
        "Bought it again , and it works now (360) I tried to buy and use this watch face after the first time it kept crashing. The watch face work with running and I'm able to make changes. Very beautiful face! Running nexus 6 (at&t) and moto 360",
        "Looks great, works bad I love the look of this watch face, but ever since the first time I tried to customize on my Moto 360, it crashes every time I try to set it. If that gets fixed it will be great.",
        "Nice but with some flaws This is a really nice watch face, one of my favorites so far, but it has some stability issues and crashed a couple times during setup. Barring that, the personalization options are very nice, although I'd love to see an option added to have accent color in always-on mode to make it a bit less bland."

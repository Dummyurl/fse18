        "Extremely user friendly. Seems so simple yet you can actually make quite a few different face looks with it. Your zodiac sign or not you can make a really nice watch face however you want with quite a few choices. Great app, and great developer one of my favorites personally.",
        "This is the best watch face I've found. Easy to customize, nice and responsive, and I love how you can save your settings. I've spent a good hour tinkering and saving presets so I can switch back and forth between my favorite styles. Excellent work designing this!!",
        "Very disappointing Too many display options. Step counter display doesn't work despite keep connecting to Google fit.  Waste of money!!",
        "Nice Work. Can't complain much. Nicely designed watch face. Menu are easy to click and face is very responsive.",
        "I've followed the instructions and factory reset and the zodiac watch is still not connecting Zodiac watch is installed but it not showing up on my watch or android",
        "Just downloaded this as part of a premium membership. Had to pay for it but it doesn't do anything won't open and can't be found. Instead of open it says refund I. App store"

        "I love the look, but it isn't compatible with my Q Explorist apparently? I'm going to miss it!",
        "Love the watchface but since the 2.0 update on my watch I can't set it up anymore. I can choose the watchface​ in the menu but when I want to set up for example the color it tries to open something. It then freezes and the only possibility to get out is to press the crown. Would be awesome if it got fixed.",
        "its a very cool watch face and all but the on watch watch face settings are completley broken(moto 360 1st gen) and when i want to set the 3 tap app on my phone the preinstaled stopwatch didnt show up please fix and ill give u 5 stars but all in all 100% would recomend to everyone",
        "I really like the look of this watch face and the customizability. Being able to keep track of the battery % of both my phone and watch is great. A feature I'd love to see, is the option to randomize the colour every month/week/day/hour/whenever I look. I can't currently modify the colors through my watch itself with Wear 2.0, looking forward to an update.",
        "Multi select settings are not working correctly on my moto 360 2nd gen",
        "Look very nice. But got error during customisation...can't choose the settings. Would be great if there is a fix!!!"

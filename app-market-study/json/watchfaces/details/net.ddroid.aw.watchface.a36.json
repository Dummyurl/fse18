        "I think I give up Love the look of this watch face and the face works fine. But I find it still slows voice activation and searches on my gear live down to a painful pace.",
        "All though the app was \"updated\" The option to change from 24 to 12 hour isn't there along with changing ....well any options.",
        "A little warning would have been nice. I bought this because it showed both analog and digital.  Had I known the digital only supported military time, I would not have gotten it.  As it is, I'll never actually use it because of this.  EDIT 9/12/2014: Pretty sure I'm reading it right... The clock face clearly says it's the 12th but it's indicating that it's Saturday and not Friday as it should.",

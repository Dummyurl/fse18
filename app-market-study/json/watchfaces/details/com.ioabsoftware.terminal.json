        "The only thing that does not work for me is the black and white mode. Otherwise this watchface is literally genious.  Also it would be great with a better mintue indicator. If that could be done! Just like the orignal has.",
        "Exactly what I was looking for! This watch face captures the spirit of majoras mask perfectly.Works great on my motto 360. I don't know why anyone would complain about hour markers just go off the minute markers. Any semi-intellgent being can read it just fine. It would be cool to see the new interactive abilities the latest android wear update added utilized here but it's perfect as is.",
        "Will it be available for Samsung Gear? I love the idea of the Termina clock, especially a functional one and not just a picture of the clock. It's the first thing I looked up, but I have a Gear S2 and it's not showing up on my watch faces. Will it ever be available for Tizen/Samsung Gear? 5 stars if so, great stuff!",
        "Oh no It breaks my heart to say that its not working on my sw2 wont even appear in smart connect, i was looking so forward to this. However i know it is amazing and i love the idea so I'll give you 4 stars but please fix this for my watch :)",
        "It's a great idea, I just wished it worked for me I have a Note 5 and Galaxy S2 Watch. I read that I should wait for the face to pop up in the Gear Wear app but I've been waiting for about 2 days now and it never appreared. I'm disappointed, but I hope you can fix this sometime soon.",
        "An amazing watch face except... It's a little hard to read. The only thing that would make this watch face even better would be the option to have hour markers on the face, if that gets implemented it will be 5 stars through and through!"

        "Version 2.1",
        "• Added \"Top Indicator\" option, which emulates a specific part of the clock tower face. May make the time easier to tell for some, may make it harder. This was a user request. Defaults to disabled, enable it in the watchface's settings.",
        "• Added options to force certain color schemes in certain watch modes."

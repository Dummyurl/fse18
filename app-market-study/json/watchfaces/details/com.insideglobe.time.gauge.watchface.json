        "Looks cool, but it's too big for my LG G Watch. The horizontal layout barely fits but isn't centered.",
        "Love it! But... This face really is great, and unique.  I do wish the colors were more customizable.  I would also like to be able to adjust settings from within wear app as well.  Still 5 stars though.",
        "Do not buy this watchface It used to be good, but since the marshmallow android wear update it just became extremely ugly and buggy",
        "More colors, please! I like the face, so far...but a few more colors would be nice. Personally, I'd like a darker blue...like navy blue with silver bars. ;-) I deducted a star because the face often stutters on wake and takes a sec to update. This has been corrected on other watch faces. So, I suspect it can be corrected here, too.",
        "It's ok Could not change settings, so I restarted my phone and watch. Right now the watch will not finish rebooting. I've removed the app. I hope when the battery dies in the watch it will be OK. Edit :it's OK. Could use more color and font choices.",
        "Notification ads A notification popped up advertising a watch face on my shade. As soon as I blocked notifications from this app it went away."

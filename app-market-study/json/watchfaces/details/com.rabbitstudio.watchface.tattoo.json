        "Not very realistic No settings to adjust skin tone. More realistic looking in the pictures than in real life. Not worth a dollar.",
        "I like it, it's a watch face",
        "Was a bit disapointed with the skintone. I understand only one is available, but didnt look as nice as I thought it would.",
        "Refund Not good could not even find the download and when i did the watch looked like, well, lets leave that shall we. you can make this for free and the same color as your skin. Not impressed",
        "Only 1 skin tone. Crazy easy to make it watchmaker with a picture of your own wrist. 0/10 not worth a dollar",

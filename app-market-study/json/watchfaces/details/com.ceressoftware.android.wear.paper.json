        "Been using for a while... Until Just recently my battery drain became awful on my Sony SW3. Couldn't work out why. Changed the watch face to a stock Sony face and I am back to 2 days rather than 6 hours. Nothing changed on my end hardware wise. Its been since February. I just thought it was the battery gone bad. Turned out when I changed the watch face battery was fine.",
        "Really cool look but... The interface is pretty clunky for options and there is no control over what gets displayed in the details. Steps would be nicer than phone battery. Seems to suck the power from my phone and watch.",
        "This watch face doesn't work with the new version of Android wear.",
        "I like it but wish there was a way to change the time to ambient mode to something like 20 seconds.",
        "Love it, it'll be nice for this app to show weather.",
        "Like it very much."

    "description": " Roto Gears A Beautiful Rotating Gears watch face for Android Wear Devices.It is no secret that gears are the concealed mechanical elements in a watch that give the needles their different and precise speeds of rotation. They work in a rhythmic unison that is fascinating to see. So we came up with the idea of doing away with the standard anterior of a dial and bringing the gears forward.Roto Gears is a simple watchface that mimics the inner mechanical design of a watch on its surface. This idea is an extension of our product, Roto 360’s design. Instead of giving the dial a single pivot as we did in Roto 360, we displaced the hour and minute dials, making them wheel close to each other like two rotating gears. The dot at the centre works as the single indicator of time.Features: • 8 Pre-defined Themes • Choose custom colors to create your own theme• Complications (Required device running Android Wear 2.0) • 12/24 Hour mode Requirements Android Wear smart watch  Compatible with: • Moto 360 - All generations• Asus Zenwatch - All generations• Huawei Watch - All generations• Fossil Q - Founder, Marshall, Wander• Tag Heuer Connected• Polar M600• Samsung Gear Live • LG - G Watch, G Watch R,  Urbane, Watch Sport, Watch Style• Sony Smartwatch 3or any Android Wear DeviceAlso check out our other watch faces • Roto 360• Time Tuner• Tymometer• RadiiCreated byGaurav Singh &Krishna Prajapati",

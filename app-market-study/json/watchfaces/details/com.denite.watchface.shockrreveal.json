        "Great looking watchface, enough that I've already purchased premium.  My 5th premium that I've purchased from you.  I will make this 5 star if you could make it more compatible with a square watch face (Asus Zenwatch 2 1.63).  That's my only complaint is that I just don't like the round face on my square watch.  Is this by any chance possible in an update?"

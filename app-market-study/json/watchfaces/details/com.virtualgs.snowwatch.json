        "Nice Very nice watch face, could do with hands being darker or black , also digital clock at the bottom could do with being slightly bigger does not show up properly on Moto 360",
        "I love it! However... I would not complain if the digital clock at the bottom was a little larger and higher because my watch cuts off the bottom",

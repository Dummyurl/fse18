        "Cute but step counter doesn't work Very cute animations, my 4 month old loves it. But the step counter just keeps going up, doesn't reset each day. Seems a bit of a major flaw for a smart watch face? Don't mind paying for the full version but step counter needs to be fixed first.",
        "Cute but you have to buy game to change face This is a cute idea, makes my watch a little laggy, which is my main complaint. Secondary complaint is that you have to buy a game and play it in order to change the watch faces. Nice idea, maybe I'll check it again later.",
        "I don't understand I purchased some faces 3 days ago and now there missing.  It wants me to purchase it again,  that's not right!",
        "Nice! But the step count just keeps going up?!  Am I missing something?",
        "I can't connect to my smart watch help me.",
        "Does it work on dz09 smart watch?"

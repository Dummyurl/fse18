ArcAngle is inspired by UsTwo's Zodiac design, but solves my main complaint with Zodiac: that its lines could extend over the numbers in the center.",

        "Nearly perfect: minimal without being too weird or hard to read, and uses a smooth, sweeping second hand.  The only thing missing is complications support, and some little touch of color, maybe an option to change the color of the hour and minute circles?",
        "Best watch face I've used Best I've used on my moto 360, and I've had one since release. It's elegant and easy to read, and I constantly get compliments from other people.",
        "I like the simplicity and the animation seems to function very well. A few options would be nice like inverting the colors.",
        "Elegant in its simplicity. Would like to see some color options added."

        "Brilliant. Very well designed simple watch faces at great value. Totally refreshing compared to the rest and what I've been waiting for.                   One request: Any chance in transitioning colours, alternating throughout day/ breathing effects?",
        "Needs some improvements The watch faces are nice, but there seems to be no way to change the colours on watch or phone. Also 9TTMM just shows a black face when screen is dimmed.",
        "Different from the rest Gorgeous watch faces and they really stand out. 4 watch faces for 35 cents each is a steal anyway. Very pleased. Keep up the great art-work.",
        "Watch faces look great, but I am unable to modify any of the settings in any of the watch faces :(",
        "Well done and stylish!"

        "Really like the design but issues on Huawei A nice selection of relatively interesting, but limited, customisations but on my Huawei watch it consumes huge amounts of battery vs the standard options (8 hours vs several days of the same use). The watch is also slow to come out of sleep with this enabled and transitions through a black and white minimal face first. As a result I'm no longer using it.",
        "Huawei Settings dont ever take effect and the movement isnt smooth. Worst menu. Google play wont refund. No phone app.",

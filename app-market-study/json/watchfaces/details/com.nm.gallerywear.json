        "It works! But... After sitting on this app for a few days it decided to work. The one major issue now that I can actually use the app is it resizes pictures into squares distorting faces and the like. Also, load times are very long, which is probably why I thought the app was nonfunctional at first. Fix these two problems and you'll have five stars. I have an HTC One M7 phone for the record.",
        "It doesn't work It really works even when it does it gets stuck",
        "Shows nothing but a black screen.",
        "Sucks",
        "not worth it. doesn't work. Screen goes black. no options on p hone to sync photos or anytype of setup menu.",
        "Waste of money I requested a refund within 2 minutes of buying this and finding it only worked once and none of the features such as tap to zoom, and scroll worked on the LG g watch.  No refund given and stuck with an app that doesn't work at ALL. Just shows a blank screen now..."

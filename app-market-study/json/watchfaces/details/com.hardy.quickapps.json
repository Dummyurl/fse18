        "Doesn't do anything Doesn't work my phone nor my watch!? Update... Talk to the Dev for 20 minutes as he tried to help with issues. Was not able to get it working, but was offered a refund. Very nice guy. I'll just be waiting for an update to see if that fixes the issues I'm having.",
        "Does not work on Android Wear... Did not work on my Samsung Gear Live.  Has a floating button to launch apps quickly, but the card does not show up on my Wear device.  Talked to the dev and it was only working in the emulator.  Hopefully he gets this fixed soon. Otherwise the app works as a quick app launcher.",

        "Awesome face I think everyone should have this face! Very easy to use and clear and easy to read!",
        "Brilliant",
        "Great face, but currently unusable on my zenwatch 2 The design is wonderful, but on my zenwatch 2 something is off with the main time display; it appears that the date is on top of the time instead of side by side with it. If fixed it would definitely be a 5 star. UPDATE: The issue seems to have solved itself,  or was fixed in an update. 5 stars!",
        "Like it Great development, originality",
        "Almost perfect! I'm with Andrei: I'd love to see a black/white pattern in standby. This face is utterly cool in active mode, but turns pretty plain in standby. Interactive button is genius.",
        "Great watch face My only complaint is that you cannot set it to display the weather in Celsius with the new interactive mode.  Seems to be accurate for my location if I do a Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion.  Otherwise this is a five star watch face for sure."

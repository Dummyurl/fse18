        "Could be better Don't know if just my watch but I take 200 steps according to other faces and Google fit, but this watch even with sensitivity set low registers about 1500 steps... Way too inaccurate!",
        "Love the watch faces. I have almost all your watch faces. I bought them for my LG G Watch R but I have recently changed to the Moto360 Sport.  Can I switch all my watch faces to the moto360 or do I have to buy them all over again?",
        "I'm using the latest Huawei watch. I like the fact that the step counter on this watch face does not require google fit on your phone. (Google fit is inaccurate)  Every thing works including the heart rate but the screen is way too busy for me. Now the negatives:  There is so much on the watch face that everything is micro size. Major battery drain! I have since switched to the Everyday watchface by HuskyDEV. Which is the best watch face I own because it has a builtin launcher and more!",
        "Turning off phone When I turn off phone I lose the four square forecast. Also needs current Temps step counter way off compared to other apps like Ranger. Why does this not work picking up my home WiFi when the phone is off.... Can't get future Temps or forecast. Just walked 30 minutes it says I walked 16.walked 1.45 miles says I took 500 steps. REAL? Sorry I bought it . update doesn't count steps",
        "Great watch face! To make this even more awesome have the ability to set day/night brightness controls - 1 for daytime and 1 for nighttime (when you typically don't need it so bright) or just another one that reduces nighttime brightness by 0-100%..",
        "Google Fit, Weather, and Colors Please link the heart rate sensor and the pedometer to use Google fit. Please make these active buttons to open the fit app. Please make the weather section also an active button to open a weather app. Please add a color generator to select colors instead of the pre defined colors. It's my favorite watchface, but there's more that can be done."

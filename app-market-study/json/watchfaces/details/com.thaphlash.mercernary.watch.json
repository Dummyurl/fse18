        "Just wanted to try it! Great watchface but I only wanted to try this and the steampunk face. It took awhile for it to install on my watch and when it did I could no longer refund it. Could I get a refund now so I can buy the steampunk face?  Thank you.",
        "Wanted to love it... I wanted to love the watch face but it keeps on crashing Android Wear and just bogs down the watch completely. I am using it on a Zenwatch 2.",
        "Love your work Great detail and creativity in all your creations. Please bring your Punisher watch face to Play Store. Thanks. üëçüëç",
        "Big fan Love your watch face, big fan of deadpool.",
        "Hmmmm.......... This watch face works perfectly, and is massively customisable but I don't find it either practical for my needs or attractive. Maybe this has to do with having a square watch (SW3) and being used to the face I have had for the past 18 months. I'll happily recommend it from a functionality point of view and it installed and operates 100%..... but the pics on the Android Authority review made it look very different from my reality. Still, it wasn't a heap of money and I hope the developer puts it to good use",
        "Awesome face This watchface is sick. With the always on feature for my LG Watch Urbane 2 the ambience mode is really cool. My only gripe is that no matter how many times I disable the analog hands, it reverts back to enabled as soon as I exit the settings. Would be a 5 otherwise."

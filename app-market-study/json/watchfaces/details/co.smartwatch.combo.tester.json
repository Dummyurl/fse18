        "I just keep coming back to this one I've downloaded (and paid for) several watch faces for my LG Urbane. This isn't the most elegant of the bunch, but I just keep coming back to this one. It's easy to use, easy to read, and clearly displays lots of useful information. It's easy to look at and fairly attractive. The only reason i didn't give it five stars is because sometimes when I'm trying to get to my apps list, it deploys its list of current info. It's good info, but when I'm trying to get to settings, well...fix this and it's five stars.",
        "Nice looking! The customization options and watchface itself looks nice and elegant. One thing I don't like is the word \"Combo\" written in middle. It sticks out too much. Maybe making it more dimmer or fading it would make it better.",
        "Brilliantly Customisability Great range of options that are FREE, for now. Finally able to make the watch face that I want. **minor negative** UI flashes on touch eg when swiping up or pressing for more information on weather etc",
        "OK but. . . Looks good but apparently some services it requires are not yet available. As a result it cannot reach my Smartwatch. I'll hold onto it in the hope there is an update to fix the issue, more stars then.",
        "Nothing short of fantastic This made me fall in love with my smartwatch all over again.  The level of customization provided by the developer here is insane.  I love this, thank you for making it available to us.",
        "I would have given 5 stars. But there is a slight glitch on moto 360. On tilt to wake it flickers while turning on display. Developers, kindly fix this issue."

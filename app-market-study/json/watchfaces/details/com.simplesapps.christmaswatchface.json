        "Can only access one image from each set. And not the ones I want!",
        "Great little app!! Great customer service too, as I was to thick to work out how to use it, thanks again David, love this app makes me smile",
        "Nice! Made my morning! I like that you can switch faces from the watch! Many nice looking faces. Since are just OK, but so many choices for a little over a buck. üëçüëå"

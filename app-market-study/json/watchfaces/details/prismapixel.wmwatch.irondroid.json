        "Great and Classy if no I.M. Droid. I agree with many of the other comments. PLEASE come out with a version that does not have the Ironman Droid. This is actually a great combination between Classy and techy, but the Droid makes it too immature to use as an everyday watch face. I would pay extra for one without the Droid.",

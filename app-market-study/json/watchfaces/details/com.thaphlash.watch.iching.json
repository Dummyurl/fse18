    "description": "I Ching is a modern digital and analog watch face for Android Wear. Like having your own personal guru, continual use of this watchface will bring the anxieties and complications of your life into blissful perspective.Why is this awesome? Because you ask yourself a question and simply tap the Yin Yang symbol in the middle of the watch face 6 times to bring up answer. Why 6 tap? The Book of changes (i ching) has a method of trowing 6 sticks to determine your answer, and i wanted to be as close as the real thing as possible.Big thanks to Brian Fitzgerald for graciously supplying the 64 bite-sized nuggets of hexagram description in this project. It manages to combine simplicity and directness, complexity and beauty.  (He also has a I-Ching app on Play you should check it out.)Heart rate monitor feature when you activate the heart rate display, the heart rate value is the metric recorded manually by the application Fit. Open Fit and ask for your heart rate... the watch face will then make a average value of all the recorded data.Fully compatible with every watch using android wear.Extremely optimized code base to make your battery last way longer than the usual watch face apps and Will work with all android wear watches, round or square, big or small.If it uses android wear, i'm on it.Take note:Sometime there's a delay getting the watch face on the watch from your phone, i recommend a bit of patience if its not instantaneous for you . This is not caused by the watch face, but rather Android Wear app.If the Application doesn't appear:- uninstall the face- restart phone- restart watch- connect watch and phone- install the watch faceYou can get more info by checking out my FAQ here: http://www.tha-icon.com/help/ LET'S HOOK UPWebsite: http://www.tha-icon.comTALK ABOUT ITG+: http://google.com/+PhlashTha",

        "This was the second (of many now) watch face I've scooped up made by Tha PHLASH. Loving the design on this one. Some of the subtle touches like the metronome are hell-a- slick.   He has so many incredible designs. I can't help myself and switch them up constantly. If you have issues check his website/instructions first... if that doesn't work he is an EXTREMELY responsive developer. Two thumbs up and a Word Up to Tha PHLASH for some awesome designs.",

        "Making ya boy work the weekends is just a shame, let him go to the movies and dinner with the wife! Otherwise, great watchface, I feel like me and Herr Schmidt have a connection. He knows me.",
        "Very innovative It is a very interesting and extremely innovative idea. Nevertheless there is a definite code improvement. The current version is heavily draining the battery. Hopefully, the next version is getting better.",
        "Nice, but... I have only one complaint......no date! Or am I missing a setting somewhere?",
        "Poor Mr Schmith It would be nice to see him doing some weekend activities but otherwise beautifully done watch face",
        "Adorable Didn't test it yet on my watch but I'm using it on my phone and is absolutely adorable. It was easy to set up and works flawlessly",
        "Not compatible with 2.0"

        "Fits all my needs, dual time, weather ( with forecast), Analog and digital, REAL ambient mode. Usually I cannot find all of that within one watch face. There is a bit of fumbling around to figure out all of the customization and widgets. The picture in the app description with instructions made that simple enough though.",
        "Weather problem My moto 360 doesn't seem to be able to display the weather. It just has an n/a. I'm hoping there's a fix...",
        "Great watch face Great watch face, love the additional options for color changes.  My only request is the option in the settings part of the App, to lock these settings, so that an accidental press or swipe of the face doesn't change a color, or widget.  Daily use of my Moto360 or any smart watch is to touch and swipe it's face, well if my finger is a little off, I end up changing a widget or a color of a button/feature.  Locking my choices made from the App would prevent this.  Otherwise I really like this watch face!!!",

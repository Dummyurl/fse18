        "Great app, the only problem is that the music player doesn't work. I can't skip, pause, go back, raise volume, lower volume, or play at all. I have to use the notification tray on my watch. Also it takes a bit to figure out how to actually make the app function. You have to keep re syncing your apps over and over before it actually sends the settings to your watch. Other than that, great app.",
        "Please fix battery drain issue; battery discharging at about ± 2% per 7 mins. Overall nice watch face - looks sweet on MK Dylan Gold.",
        "Just bought the premium and none of the interactions are working.  Really disappointed.  I'd like a refund",
        "Beautiful interface, but dissapointed that it only registers steps from phone, and not from watch. I don't carry my phone on me at all times so the count is not accurate.",
        "I could not set up on my Huawei smart watch. Doesn't working.",
        "Just purchased, please add feature vibrate on hour. Thanks"

        "Best app out there for local music from the watch - a pair of Bluetooth plugs and then you have all you need without your phone. Way better than Google music which is a mess when it comes to local music in the watchüëç",
        "A decent standalone music player for android wear with a good control interface . Also support earphone's remote control . However , transflective screen support seems missing , hardly visible under bright sunlight . Would be great for better control interface .",
        "Great way to play offline music. Developer listens for feedback and makes changes!",
        "App said that it's installed, can't find it on my phone. My watch want me to pay for it again when I try to download it.",
        "I installed the app it didn't even show up anywhere. On my phone",
        "Works perfectly, has an FTP server built in that works with more than music. What is there to complain about?"

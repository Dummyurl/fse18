        "Would like to use this The face doesn't show up as an option to set on my moto 360. I've factory reset, uninstalled and reinstalled, no dice. Very frustrating.",
        "I'm a big fan of this watch face on my Moto 360.  The phone app offers a good amount of customization, allowing you to turn down or off the 3D effects, alter the graininess and frequency of static and do a few other things.    My only complaint is that, like a lot of heavily animated watch faces, it seems to be a real battery vampire, even with the 3D effects turned off."

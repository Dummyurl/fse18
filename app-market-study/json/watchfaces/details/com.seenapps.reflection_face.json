That's the great thing about it.Designed is preserved in ambient mode, although scaled down to black and white.Settings will let you choose between 7 colors and 3 layout modes (Checkered, Light and Inverted) for a total of 21 watches :)Support of 12/24h mode is automatic based on your locale settings.The sample has been taken on a 24h mode device. It Would Show something like M00/0000 on a 12h device.This face is an original creation.The disturbed font has been created by Yoan Maman (contact@yoanmaman.fr)For questions or concerns about this face, please contact support@seenapps.comIf you like our faces, don't miss the good stuff at https://twitter.com/SeenApps",

        "Love it! I love this watch face. My only complaint is that it will say for example two f****** five instead of two f****** o five. It also has the same issue with three o' clock for example where it will have a blank minutes field thus not making sense. Despite this, it has stayed my watch face for a very long time (except when around children or at formal events) and will continue to.",
        "Works great.  Always gets a laugh when people ask me for the time or to see my watch.  Speaking of which, all you people saying it doesn't work on  your Gear S2, this is an android wear watchface.  It says so in the description.  Your watches run Tizen OS, not android wear.",
        "Not working Don't know why it is not working on my watch. Need this badly. Model:Smart watch U9. Help me!",
        "Help! Gear s2 I have a Samsung GALAXY S7 and the Samsung Gear S2. All it says is check your watch face. But I've checked it and all my settings. And it's not coming up on my watch face. Any help?",
        "I love it but cant use it I want it on my galaxy s6 and gear 2. Its not working any help??",
        "Works perfectly on my LG Urbane with Galaxy S7. Would be great if the words can be edited; other sayings, etc.  getting lots of attention and laughs."

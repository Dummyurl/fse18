        "I'm leaving 5 stars just for the support alone!  Developer was very quick to respond, and provided excellent support.  I wish more devs were like this.  As for the watch itself...  Oh so many options to choose from!  This dev really knows how to pack the features in there.  My poor Moto 360 (1st gen) is going to get a work out!   (Insert Evil Laugh Here.)  Beautiful designs from an excellent developer.  It doesn't get much better than that.",
        "Nice looking face Another great design from this dev. The orange ring is a little too bold for me, but the watch face looks great!"

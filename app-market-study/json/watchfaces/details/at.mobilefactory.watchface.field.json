        "Needs more Great concept, but ineffectually executed. The altimeter function does not always work and there are no customization options to change from meters to feet. Also the time setting is in military and cannot change to standard.  This would be the perfect watch face if these items were addressed",
        "Very awkward to get sunrise/set, moonrise/set. It's strangely affected by whether always-on is selected.  If Always-on is not selected on the watch, only sunrise is given when one taps to see the face. To get the other 3 times, you need always-on selected, and then to see the different times, you need to tap and allow to disappear (except for the current time which remains in ambient mode) and then retap to get another of the rise/set times. Repeated tapping while in bright mode doesn't help; it stays on the same datum.  The watch should allow a setting for how long it remains in bright mode, and then also cycle through the four rise/set times during that interval. Better yet, show all four rise/set times simultaneously.  Moon phase would be appreciated also. There's room, especially on a rectangular face.",
        "Close to great The face looks great on my LG G Watch R. However, it is missing 2 crucial things: 12/24 h option for the main time and the option to show in the bottom display UTC time (In 12/24h independent of the main time display type)",
        "Needs bloody 12 hr mode Come on guys have some common sense and put a 12 hr function on it ffs",
        "Init UI error when trying to use settings on the watch. Compass and altimeter have never worked. I'm on a Moto 360. Thumbs up for this purchase :)",
        "i know it's a military style face , but give me the option of 12hr mode. otherwise it's useless to me half of the day. great design otherwise."

        "I would love to see you give us the ability to change specific things in the settings for these faces. For example, changing the date format to the day followed by the month, a smooth second hand vs. the ticking second hand, and letting us create our own watch faces - borrowing certain aspects from other faces, and even creating our own patriotic faces with different templates.",
        "Cool, good looking watch faces. Works with Huawei Watch 2.",
        "Does not work with Samsung S3",
        "Does not seem to work with the Samsung Gear S2 Classic",
        "Please allow those with Samsung Gear to get these........",
        "A good start!  The faces look and work great.  I would like to be able to read the date instead of having it under the card preview though."

        "Message to developer Hi I got this watch face because in my opinion it's the most coolest looking one. Would rate it 5 but problem I have is that the 9 and 6 and 7 look strange. Is it possible to fix that please?",
        "Just a few touch ups and it could one of the most popular faces ever It would be great if it didn't show up in my phones app drawer. And the time gets covered by notification cards, cancelling. the convenience of smart watch.  Love it to pieces otherwise.",
        "Works now Finally fixed it no thanks to the developer",
        "Won't show up in my watch faces",
        "Coolest watch face",
        "Looks nice, however... The design is very nice and ambient mode works a treat, however the card previews are too large and block the time. It needs an option to use the smaller card previews, otherwise it's a bit useless. I know the dev is responsive, so I hope they take this on board. EDIT: The lack of response from developer has forced me to change my review. Watch face is useless if cards cover the time."

        "Good",
        "Like it - beautiful watch face But...I know for a fact that it drains the battery pretty fast.  Used to drain about 3% per hour...now its between 8 - 10% per hour.  Please fix as this is one watch face that old like to have a my main go to face",
        "Love the look I was planning on sticking with Motorola's \"Minimal\" watchface - until I saw this. My only request is that the seconds hand wasn't visible in dimmed mode - UPDATE: added by developer!",
        "Good for Moto 360 If you are using the moto 360 it doesn't get cut off at the bottom which is absolutely great. Although some customization would be great! Also, and update for 5.0 features would be a good addition.",
        "The best I've seen to date! :) Wonderful watch face! My favorite!"

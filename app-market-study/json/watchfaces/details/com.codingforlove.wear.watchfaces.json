        "Awesome watchface; most interesting one I've come across yet. Also one of the most useful watchfaces in dimmed mode; very readable. I have two requests though: (1) optional 24h-format; I can't get used to 12h format. (2) Notifications in dimmed mode overlay the clock and become unreadable.   Other than that: perfect."

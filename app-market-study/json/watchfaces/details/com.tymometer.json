        "Apart from my general disappointment with Android Wear this watch face is quite good and sharp opposed to most out there where they get all pixalated when set.. Worth the price so far!",
        "Looks good but… There are no options to change the colors or settings on the watch and it dumps an unnecessary entry into your app drawer.",
        "Favorite watch face Simple, easy to read, and very sharp looking. A small battery level indicator would be ideal, but even without that this is my favorite watch face on a Moto 360.",
        "Very good but Great easy to read face would be 100% if I could get rid of the second hand and make the design full screen",
        "Did not appear on android wear app. Also not appear on my watch. Using lg g watch",
        "My favorite watch face! The only downside is that there is no option to show the date on the watch face."

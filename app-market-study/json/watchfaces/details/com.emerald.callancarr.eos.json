        "Battery saver I don't ever comment but this app really helped with my battery life it made a huge difference I gave 4 stars because of 24 hour clock but other than that it was worth buying",
        "Digging the simple and cheery colours a lot! Been using it all day and am so surprised at how much battery I have left with only one charge! I don't know how they did it but this has seriously made me love my watch even more, more than any other app I've downloaded because a big problem for me is how quickly the battery gets drained. I've been following Emerald Software for its past few releases and I must say that I am very impressed with the quality of the apps they produce. Big thanks to the team!"

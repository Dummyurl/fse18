        "4.999998 Stars Really great. It acknowledges the design of the 360, its simple, easy to read and informative. My only very minor gripe is that I wish there were a 12 hour digital option. That said, please don't start overbloating this with features. The beauty is in the simplicity.",
        "Waste of time Could of been a good watch IF YOU WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO AFTER THE DIGITAL TIME, I NEED A TIMEZONE NOT TO BE TOLD THE SAME TIME TWICE. IN LUA ITS SIMPLE TO DO. THOSE WHO CAN'T TELL 24H TIME FOR THEMSELVES CAN SET IT TO DO THAT. THE REST OF US CAN HAVE A TIMEZONE. TOOK IT OFF MY WATCH. CAN MAKE FAR BETTER. SEE G+",
        "Didn't know you could change the colours to make it more unique.   I would like to see numbers 3 6 9 in the colours of the digital clock that would look soo cool",
        "Really works for moto360 Please add more colour styles. When you introduce new faces and features please leave the old ones as they are. Thx",
        "The watchface is fine but... Unfortunately, my device's battery (Moto 360, 1st Gen) seems to last about half the time with this on, as opposed to a stock one, or from WATCHMASTER.",
        "Not as  expected boring... The only thing whick clicked me is the dual display culd have made it more interesting by adding customization on watch faces. Only colours change but wat  bout the hands and stuff. And in the new update please ADD A SECONDS HAND in the ambient mode then i will give 5 stars... Choclate...jokes apart make it more interesting oki thanks"

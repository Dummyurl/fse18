        "A little too basic. Feels unfinished. Could be amazing with the option for a digital clock in the middle with some basic settings like 24/12 hour mode and am/pm. Its a shame because this looks amazing but I can't bring myself to use it or reccomend it to anyone because it's difficult to tell the time with this."

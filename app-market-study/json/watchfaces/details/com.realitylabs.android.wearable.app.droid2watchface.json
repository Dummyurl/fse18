        "Love it! It's looks so good too! I would love a bb8 version!",
        "FANTASTIC  Apart from R2D2 being the coolest droid ever... love this watch face, Looks great and is not a battery drain at all. With the latest update you stepped it upto RAD status for me.  WELL WORTH THE MONEY! #maytheforcebewithyou",
        "Love this watchface so far - exactly what I was looking for, and I love looking down to see lil R2-D2. I think it'd be great to add a BB-8 one, especially as their design is already geared around a circle shape!",
        "Not working on my huawei watch after android wear 2.0 update",
        "Amazing skin!",
        "Latest update made the watchface not work. LG Watch Sport."

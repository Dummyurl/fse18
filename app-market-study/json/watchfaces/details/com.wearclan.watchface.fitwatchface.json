        "Except that any customization you might want to do will cost you money (at $0.99 a pop), the watch face looks really nice as is.  Using it on my G watch ...  I will have to evaluate for a few more days to comment on battery performance.",
        "NOT Google Fit Says it links to google fit for steps ..it absolutely doesn't. Shameful and misleading... Uninstall",
        "It does work I waisted my money  the app does not work, It would not  connect to my smart watch.",
        "Spam Scam Asked me to swipe on my watch to install another Acorn Studios watch face! This is bull**** and I won't touch your apps. I paid for it but will never use it.",
        "Incorrect Data The information displayed are not correct. Google fit had different data",
        "I can't switch to miles. It is stuck in kilometers. I bought premium hoping it would let me but nope! Also there is no digital watch face. I am so disappointed. I want a refund. This looked so cool but disappointed so much"

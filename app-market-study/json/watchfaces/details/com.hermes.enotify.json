        "This is a life saver to get the notifications I need and not be overwhelmed with the clutter.",
        "Great app, works well, never miss an alert or important message.  Great for oncall people",
        "This is a good App. I use it for text and email alerts. Quite comprehensive app.  Emailed developer regarding a minor issue and was prompt with his reply. Definitely recommend this app. One thing I do wish fixed is the length of time notification bar shows the exclamation mark before it disappears. I have to quickly get to my device before the alert in the notification bar disappears. If I miss it then I have to try to catch it during the next alert cycle. It has kinda become a game now. lol. Regardless it a good app and I hope one day Glen can include missed call alerts as well",
        "Only thing I have found disappointing is that the notification pop up cancels repeating sound alerts so that you cannot effectively have both. If you want repeating sound alerts you cannot have pop up notification. Unless I don't know how but I tried for days lol and couldnt do it.",
        "Excellent tool for anybody that does after hours support and relies on getting notified for urgent issues. Offers same functionality the the blackberry P1 notifications but for sms as well.",
        "does what I need"

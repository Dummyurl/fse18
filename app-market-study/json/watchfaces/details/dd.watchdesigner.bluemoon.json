        "The background should be replaced by a HIGH quality one.  For example, default Blue MoonPhase face for huawei watch has a very high quality background.",
        "Great looking but mini dials are wasted This is a super looking watch face and light on battery. To get 5 stars I would like to see dual (watch and phone) battery displays on the battery circle dial (see the new skymaster face) and why have a second hand AND a dial that shows seconds? An option to remove the liongate text and just keep the icon would be welcomed",
        "Nice design Great design but the analogue ambient mode is either to simple or has too much. Needs a a mode in between. There full mode will eat through battery as it has a blue background on an amoled screen.",
        "Good Like many of this devs faces, it is not centered on the Moto 360. Needs to be moved a couple pixels to the right (not sure exactly how many)."

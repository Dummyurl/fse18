        "I like this watch face but could you make it more interactive? Like adding app shortcutsto the watchface",
        "Works good on LG Watch Sport! THX!",
        "Pretty but very imperfect It's 9am in New York. My watch still thinks it's night.  I can't convince it otherwise. Its been light for 3 hours. If this were the dead of winter, it would have been light for 1.5 hours. This sounds like a petty complaint but this watch face's whole point is to display the weather graphically and it can't do night and day properly.  It's also clear skies but the watch thinks it's cloudy.",
        "Great watch face, simple, clean and great on battery life (with animations off). Keep up the good work, future improvements maybe changing the colour scheme.",

        "It would be great if it stayed connected. Maybe it's just not compatible with Android N 7.1 yet? If it did ever work for me, I would like to see user customizable faces. Colors, hands, etc.",
        "Terrible app. Free version is glitchy. The watch face is of poor quality. If you want me to buy it make your 10 day trial worth it. No where near worth it.",
        "Terrible app. Very glitch and doesn't even have MLB.",
        "Paid for the app and NCAAB is empty in March? No scores?",
        "I love this app The watchface are beautiful (love the dwsign) and i can follow all my sport league.",
        "Awesome Works perfectly and the dev team is great in getting back to you. Thank you and great job."

        "I like the watchface and i have it on from the past 6 months, but i need to sat that there are not many updates. We need some new backgrounds for the watchface and more bugs fixes in syncing of the phone battery. Even some more customisation for the time and date and how to place them. It is an expensive watchfacecompared to other watchfaces and when you buy expensive stuff u expect regular updates and new things.",
        "I miss being able to change the color of the ambient light like that of the not pro version, just black and white is boring. Perhaps they can push out an update? Besides that it's my favorite watch face so far.",
        "Just an awesome watch face. Love the customization, look of the date/cal and weather, the overall look of everything is just really good. This and  A4-1 round are my two favorite watch faces and I've gone through tons. I'm very picky. Good job Devüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",
        "Edit : does no work well with Android wear 2.0. Colors do not switch, watch face cannot be customized. Please fix  Love this watch face design!! Great job devs. However, the watch face sometimes takes a few seconds to redraw...",
        "I used to love it... Before Android wear 2.0, now I can't customize anything, I just get the ambient screen all the time and sometimes a background. Horrible, and haven't seen an update in ages.",
        "Good watch face. The only issue I've  encountered is the weather widget seems to get the wrong date. It is showing summer temperatures in winter :)"

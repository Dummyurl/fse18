        "This clock is a crock of crap. Hard to see colors can't be changed, nor much of anything else without BUY PREMIUM popping up. May say FREE on the tin, but it's mostly featureless. Then, when I TRY to do just that, it attempts to open Google play on phone, but can't find anything related to it. Even searched for \"VizorWatch\" as the watch screen says, nothing on Google Play can be found other than a 99 cent ROUND face version of it. Cannot even switch to another face on the watch as Watchmaker running this seems to completely hijack the watch, so you have to open the phone to switch faces to something else. ANNOYING. Got tired of wasting time with it, and removed it from my phone/watch.",

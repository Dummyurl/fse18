        "I like the simplicity. Wish it used the smaller notification style so they didn't cover up the time I'm trying to see. That's my only nitpick.",
        "Like the design but should have a 12 hour option.  Don't want to do math to determine it is 9pm at night.",
        "Nice clean watch face, but it lacks the option to display 12 hour time.",
        "Really nice cool looking watch face! I like its minimalistic design.",
        "Installed this just this morning 8am, it's already 4:15pm and still waiting for it to appear on my watch. What happened?"

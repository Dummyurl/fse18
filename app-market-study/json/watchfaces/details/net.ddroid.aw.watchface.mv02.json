        "FIX FOR MISSING WATCHFACE! Also: if you need the settings (like for weather, location, etc.) for the watchface and can't find the settings app, it's because they've updated it and it's now accessed by tapping the gear on the watchface in the Android Wear app when the watchface is current and working. Different phones work differently with apks so for reference I have a Moto Z Play Droid upgraded to Android 7.0.0 Nougat. Worked fine at first but then stopped showing up.. re-Edited UPDATE: Soo I got it to come back.. the only way was by MAKING SIRE it was Gone from the watch (&phone) by checking it's storage From it's settings in the Android Wear app, restarting both, and cleanly re-installing the app, followed by keeping the \"normal moto\" watchface from sleeping until (the only way to enable this thing) pops up; a notification saying you have a new watchface and to tap to enable it.",
        "Doesn't show up on moto 360 Can I have my money back please? This clearly doesn't show up on the moto 360, as stated numerous times by other victims.",
        "Was great with lolipop Was awesome with lolipop but when I upgraded to a marshmallow phone it no longer syncs the phones battery and weather. Would be a 5 if they fixed that.",
        "üëç Great watch",
        "Like it I really like it, but I wish there were more color options. I'd like a pip boy green color and perhaps even orange. Still very cool and works well on my gen 1 moto360.",
        "Not as nice as it looks. Absolutely zero customization and the weather app part doesn't work."

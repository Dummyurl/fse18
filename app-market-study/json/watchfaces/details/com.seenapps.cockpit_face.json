    "description": "Here is my attempt at the \"Cockpit\" watch face. This is the fourth watch in ny \"Pilot's Toolkit\" series.This face displays hours, minutes, day of the week, day of the month, seconds, battery level and ... wrist angle!Altimeter is used for Hours, Minutes, Day of the Week and Day of the Month. I tried to keep it simplistic to improve legibility. In ambient mode, this is the only lit instrument.Airspeed indicator is showing battery level. I had to reverse the colors order from red to green to be consistent with battery life, otherwise it is fairly close to the original instrument look and feel.Heading Indicator is used for seconds. Your plane will be making a continuous starboard turn at 6 degrees per second.Attitude Indicator is fully functional. Go fly you watch! (v2.0+)You can use in watch settings to select which rotation axis to use. By default, pitch and roll are enabled but you can change this settings at will (v2.1+).The dark carbon fiber texture doesn't quite belong in a Cockpit but looks much more stylish on the wrist than grey brushed metal! It is also less demanding on battery life.Altimeter and Heading indicators are available as their own watch faces. They should show in the links below.Do not hesitate to drop feature requests at support@seenapps.comIf you like our watches, don't miss the good stuff https://twitter.com/SeenApps",

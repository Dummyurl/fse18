        "Really good, but could be better This watch face is one of the best faces on the market that I have found!. The only thing I think it needs improvement in is. Interaction! Click on the weather all and see the forecast. Click on the time - get a stop watch or alarm. The ambient like could use some work also. Maybe invert it. Just make it black n white. But this face is still awesome! Worth the cash...wait..I forgot if it's free or paid... Anyways, little thing's need work. Great face",
        "On the top of my list! This is a great looking watchface and one of my faves.   The only issue is when you select a different colour from default, when it wakes up,  it goes orange then the colour you chose...  Everything else is super.",
        "I love this watch face. Its one of the only watch faces that I've found that can pass for a traditional watch in ambient mode. Also the full color ambient mode doesnt drain the battery on my LG Gwatch R like some other watch faces. I have one request though. Ambient mode is always the default orange color. I'd like the color in ambient mode to be the same color that is selected for active mode."

Current date (in green) shows Day of the week, Day of the month, Month and Year. In yellow, you can seen current Hours, Minutes and Seconds using a slightly bigger font for legibility.This is quite different from the original display, which was showing 3 full dates and time.The layout has been altered to fit round faces, with an emphasis on current time.The second time (red) is adjustable via on-watch menu and persisted on the device so it doesn't get lost when you switch faces. You may notice the sticker labels (black and red background) are using a punch-in font to replicate the original look and feel. In ambient mode, background and labels are hidden to only display LED text.For the record, this face gave me a much harder time than the classical hand based due to a scaled-sprite based rendering as opposed to just drawing thing around.Do not hesitate to drop feature requests at support@seenapps.comIf you like our watches, don't miss the good stuff https://twitter.com/SeenApps",

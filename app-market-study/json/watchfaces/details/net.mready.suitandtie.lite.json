        "It's alright The idea and color scheme are nice and I was pleased that the design compensates for the black bar at the bottom of the Moto 360. But once installed it looks kind of cartoon-ish and needs some finer detail. Installed it doesn't look as refined as in the sample pictures.",
        "Won't let me change anything after upgrading to pro.  Uninstaller and refunded. .  I like the face but it won't give me access. . Tell me what I am doing wrong and I'll try again and re-create but it should be easier than that.....",
        "Can't upgrade I like that face but I've been trying to upgrade to Pro for days and it never works.  It says\" error in the process \" I never have this problem with other faces",
        "Would not upgade. I PAID FOR PRO BUT IT WON'T WORK.",
        "Smart classic Looks really nice on the LG urbane A bit different from the others. It's a good one for outdoor in sunny weather",
        "Could not upgrade to pro. Every time i try to upgrade to pro it says your order could not be processed. I have tried waiting a week and tried different credit cards all of which work fine with other watch faces. Please fix and I'll upgrade."

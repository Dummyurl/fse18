        "Not nearly as customizable as the page makes it out to be. The \"premium\" features severely lack any customization. What's worse is I had to buy this to determine how the premium functions looked.   Terrible design, there should be a free live preview just like the free options what each premium feature does before paying.  I paid to find out the premium features don't do what one would expect.   If I get a refund I will gladly take this review down but as it stands, I won't be buying any Watch faces from this dev.",
        "I did paid for full version but unable to edit customized the watch face. When i set at the phone app and send to the watch s gear 3, the watch face still the same as the free version, no changes. Please do something about this otherwise i won't rate 5 star.",

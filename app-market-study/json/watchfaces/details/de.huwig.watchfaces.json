        "Not working right. Please tell me how to refund I bought the paid version but it doubles my lock screen. I have to go through the original watch lock screen  then this one and now after restart of watch it doesn't work at all. I really liked the concept",
        "Great but crashes watch Installed this on my doogee s1 smartwatch, and after about 2 mins, I get system authorization, you device will shut down in \"20 sec\" countdown timer and watch powers down.  Edit: installed, turned off Wi-Fi for hour, when turned back on it licences fine and works fine. Only crashes system if it tries to get licence straight after installing",

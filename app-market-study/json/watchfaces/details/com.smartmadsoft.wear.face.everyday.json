    "description": "Everyday for Android Wear is digital watch face with big digits and second indicator.*** This watch face was designed for Android Wear 1.x so the time is off center to allow for display of peeking notification cards. Please see the successor \"Just Time\" watch face that is simple and clean, designed for Android Wear 2: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brouken.wear.face.justtime (it's still work in progress) ***Its main purpose is to quickly read time in a glance with higher than minute resolution - so this watch updates time every 20 seconds instead of only once a minute.The extra screen updates doesn't result in any noticeable battery drain (no more than 5%). It also works and looks great on Sony SmartWatch 3 thanks to transflective lcd. It is not suitable (burn-in protection may not be enough) for OLED.There are some configurable options: 12/24 hour modes, white on black or inverted, font size and typeface, font outline (because of background support), and few other things to toggle (date, seconds, top ambient battery line).Everyday Watch Face also allows you to have custom clock background. Just share any image on your phone with \"Everyday Watch Face\" and it will be set as the background.",

        "There is a bug I suppose. When I put a custom background on the watchface, the am and battery percentage indicator cast a kind of shadow, towards the right, which is kind of annoying.  Otherwise this is the watchface I was looking for.",
        "Exactly what I was wanting and it installs directly onto my watch from the Google Play store with in my Android Wear 2 watch. Thank you!  I would like the ability to display a leading zero when using the 24-hour display option. Where can I donate to your project?",
        "Exactly what I was looking for LOVE IT and you can put any photo as background... This is the BEST app for your smartwatch. 10 stars if I could.",
        "This is the best watch face so far I found., the only issue is in ambient mode, there is a white line on the top left and it drives me crazy...it sometimes goes away but it does reapear.",
        "Simple and easy to read. I think it's less battery intensive as well.",
        "This is the best digital watch face on the play store. very simple very customizable can even change the font and font size thank you very much"

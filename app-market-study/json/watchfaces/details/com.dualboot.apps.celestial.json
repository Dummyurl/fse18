        "Very nice looking watchface (Originally thought it had battery issues but tried again later and have had no problems since - apologies to devs). Both normal and ambient look great, and the ambient-to-normal animation is eye catching. Only minor issue: On the Huawei, the normal-to-ambient transition doesn't always work in always-on mode (eg it will go black for several minutes or stay in a dimmed version of normal).",
        "It's okay but not customized. I paid for it and kinda wish I hadn't. I can't customize the engraving or message as advertised. It keeps telling me to get the basic which I have the only one they offer. So I keep seeing pics of strangers. Image is also  blurry and time hard to see.",
        "Wont install from Google Play on Note 4 I really like the look but I can't get it to install from Google play.  Play has been stuck on Installing for a couple of days now.  I'm sure I'll love it if it will ever install. - UPDATE - Finally installed and is fantastic.",
        "Love it but I thought when this was made into a square watchface either the corners would be filled in or dial would have been squared. Not the the display would be cropped into squareness. Looks a bit unfinished now. Dev no longer listens.",
        "I just installed it yesterday my watch was @ 100% @ 7 a.m. by 9:45 a.m. i was already @ 23% battery life. Does it drain out that much battery. It does look nice but if that's  a problem then I'll uninstall it",
        "Awesome watchface This is one of the better looking watchfaces out there. With the android 5.1.1 update,  there was a slight alignment problem that was very quickly fixed. This is actually one of the watchfaces I use when showing off the moto360."

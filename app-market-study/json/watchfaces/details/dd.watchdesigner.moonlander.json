        "Won't download to my watch. Please refund my money.",
        "Perhaps I have poor taste, judging by the other comments, but I rather like this face. I like the design, and the ambient mode is pretty good in its own way while also possibly preventing burn-in and being fairly readable, and as for the main face, I like the little details in it, such as the edge of the rotating gear that sticks out in the date window.",
        "Good Not amazing, but not bad either. I think a lot of people here are being a bit harsh. It's very simple for what it is and that is both good and bad. Good because it's a nice, basic watch face with just a touch of pizazz. Bad because the ambient mode is meh and the customization options aren't great. Overall though, I like it!",
        "Worlds worst watch face This is by far worst watch face design I have ever seen in my life. I've never had to uninstall a watch face untill I came this ugly face.",
        "Moon Lander Watch face It won't load on to my Android phone's screen, why? And concider making the face a more appropriate and beautifully thought out and designed space themed starry background with the earth as part of the functions",
        "Garbage I've haven't immediately uninstalled a face yet until this one. The ambient view sucks and the regular view isn't much better."

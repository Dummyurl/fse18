        "There were some problems initially, i.e. the screen kept reseting from ambient to normal mode. There are still problems, like the temp indicator stuck at F instead of C as set.   But this is the most beautiful design, and many kudos for including the step counter.   I now wish the temp indicator is fixed.",
        "Ambient mode on this watch face has caused permanent burn in on my watch screen :-( Huawei Watch 1. Maybe a bug in ambient mode position adjustment or white levels. User beware.",

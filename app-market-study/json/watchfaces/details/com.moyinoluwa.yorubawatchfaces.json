        "Innovative! This is a commendable effort. There is no app like it in Yoruba language, so it is innovative. It can be of great help to those who read only Yoruba, a learning tool for those who want to learn the language, and a useful app for comparative language study.",
        "Glitches Hi Moyin, ìséjú is missing the S and the app doesn't state the minutes (fún àpeere: \"aago méjo ku ì éjú\" dípò \"méjo ku ìséjú méwàá\") on my phone.",
        "Add voice Great job. I think you should add voice capabilities also. It should tell me the time in yoruba when i tap a button",
        "Epic! @moyinoluwa adeyemi",

        "We know how much you love to make your app yours so we also built a customizable mobile application for you to view the time in Yoruba too."

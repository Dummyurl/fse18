        "Overall, I like it.  There's only one thing I would really change about it.  I have no use for the \"week\" portion of the display, and it would be helpful if this face had a battery percentage of your phone displayed.  It would be perfect if I had the option to display phone battery percentage in the spot that \"week\" currently uses.  That would earn a 5 star from me.",

        "Not bad. I like",
        "A++ watch system updated Better lasting battery. Very nice. Well worth the buck. Thanks n keep up the good work. After a few months of  testing. Lowering the brightness to 50% within your home  adds significant battery life from a depressing battery drainer other wise. Where's the windup or automatic standard these days. Why still a battery on these types of watches"

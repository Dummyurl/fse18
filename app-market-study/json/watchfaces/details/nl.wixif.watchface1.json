        "Great watch face Everything I want, but would love an ambient mode to save my LG G Watch R screen from burn in!",
        "L.Euric This watch definitely does not look anything like the advertised picture (except the one image showing a men wearing the Moto . It looks super 2D on my G Watch R. Not worth it, unless they can make the graphic looks MORE realistic than the built in \"realistic\" setting.",
        "Really good Very good timezone watch. Well made and 3 design colours. Not impressed with the paid for watches, but like this.",
        "Amber Face The Amber Face blocks access to notification.  Moto 360.                    Developer recommend restart of Moto 360.  Works fine.  Do not use because the Face is too cluttered to easily read. Looks better on the Play Store",
        "Love this watch face. More colors in the future would be awesome.",
        "Love this face My favourite face. Doesn't drain the battery like so many other pretty faces."

        "I loved this watch face and it was always an ice breaker for conversion when people noticed. Now, it doesn't seem compatible with my watch at all? All other apps and faces with fine and everyone is connected... Just not showing up as a watch face anymore.   Zen Watch 3/Galaxy Note8",
        "Great watchface. Time and percentages don't show up in line with the text on my Huawei watch though, if this could be fixed it would be amazing",
        "The time gets covered up when there is a card preview",
        "Can the time be higher? I love the face, but would love to see the time above my cards.",
        "Nice idea and design I like it but please make text as large as possible for readability. I have the lg g watch w100 first gen.",
        "Not working Would not display on Android Wear app using Nexus 6P and Huawei Watch."

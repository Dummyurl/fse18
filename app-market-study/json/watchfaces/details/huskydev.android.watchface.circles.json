        "Functional, but that's it It is a decent watchface, nothing exceptional. But it does not update temperature info correctly, what's unacceptable for a paid watchface (always shows 19 degrees). Either fix the bug or remove the misleading/broken functionality.",
        "Nice Nice watch face. Interactive features don't work well. Would like to be able to turn them off or replace them with second time zone. Wish you could select only the accent colors you want for automatic change.",
        "Pretty and functional It's a very nice looking watch. Lots of color options and rather functional with a very responsive team (great job guys!). I know phone battery is coming which is will probably make it my daily watch face. The only thing that could be improved is adding more options for the user such as deciding what icons(I.e. battery or weather) are displayed and choosing when the colors change or which colors are on the automatic cycle.",
        "Once again face is nice but ambient is crap and can't be customized. I want to be able to change that ugly font, size and location on screen and an option to add date"

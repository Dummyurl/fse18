        "I upgraded my phone to the S8 Active and I can no longer change my watch face. Is there a fix? I used to have an LG phone but ditched them after 20 years.",
        "It should not need a rocket scientist for such a simple task",
        "Bought App. Selecting photo in the app on phone does not transfer to my wear 2 watch fossil Q wander. I get just 3 options on watch face nature, animal and random. I can't send photo from my gallery. Will refund the money if it doesn't work",
        "I had the free version and liked it so much that I decided upgrade. Photo watch 2 allows you to add interactive tiles so you can access apps from the face. The real reason I like this app is that I feel it allows you to have information on the face without blocking all of your photo background. It's the best of both worlds, an attractive face with everything I need! Nice job!",
        "I'm not able to choose my custom photo as watch face there's only 3 options either animal/nature/random ðŸ˜‘",

        "Seems like it would be really great, but at this time, either my watch (moto360 gen2) or Android Wear 2.0 does not allow the install. Install just says \"download pending\" and never changes. Tried several times, giving each try at least an hour to download. First time I gave it all night (about 10 hours). Restart of phone and watch did not help. Removal of apps did not help.  I do like the docking mode by this maker... Just wish this would work.",

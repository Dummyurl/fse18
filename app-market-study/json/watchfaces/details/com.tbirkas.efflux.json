When the hour begins a line starts growing from the center of the canvas and  at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min it reaches a ring. Every filled line is an hour.Bugs and other problems:This software has not been tested on a real device, only on the emulator. There could be bugs what I didn't had on the emulator test run. If you find one then feel free to inform me about it and I will fix it.",

        "Innovative but boring on dim Love the idea. The colour is now fixed but is still grey in dim mode? Is that by design, I'd like it to be the colour all the time, or an option to choose the dim mode colour because grey is v dull. Also,  the hour hand grows grey before changing colour which looks odd. Then I think it would be 5 stars. Thx. Re reply,  perhaps an option and grey by default would still fit spec? Is that possible?",

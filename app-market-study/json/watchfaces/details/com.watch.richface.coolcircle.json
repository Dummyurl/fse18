        "I love the watchface and bought premium but not working right On my new watch. ASUS ZenWatch 2. The ambient mode looks horrible on the AMOLED screen. I had an LG G Watch with a LCD screen and it worked fine. The buttons don't work and can't change the color with the tap. It seems like none of the settings apply except color changing on the phone",
        "I love the look of the watch face and even bought Premium.  However, that was a disappointment.  Once enabled, you can turn off the weather icon/updates and there is no unread notifications icon, which many of the newer watch faces have.",
        "Battery sucker I feel like i wasted my money on this watchface. Installed it on my moto360 2nd gen.battery level drops at a very faster rate  as compared to other watchfaces. Moreover many bugs as mentioned in other comments. Waste of money",
        "Looks good but the premium options are real buggy.  Uncheck \"change color on tap\" and it still changes color on tap. Color changer in app doesn't work until I change the face and reapply it. Ok Google in center doesn't work.",
        "I love the face that's why I bought it but please fix one thing It isn't showing me any steps all it shows is 0 steps please fix that. I have a moto 360 1st Gen.",
        "Needs update I loved the design so I paid for premium. Unfortunately there exist some irritating limitations. The watch face color toggle in settings no longer works; I cannot lock in my selected color, and always risk changing it by touching the watch face. The ability to activate \"Ok Google\" by tapping the watch face also does not work. Furthermore, the weather forecast does not even display current day's forecast--only the next several days. I have no idea what the high or low will be later on today. Not worth the $1"

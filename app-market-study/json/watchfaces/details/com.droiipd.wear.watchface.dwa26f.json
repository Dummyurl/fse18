        "Won't leave you alone until you rate it I keep getting notifications constantly to rate this watch face. It's a fine watch face, but I don't want to be spammed 4 times a day from a tiny app among hundreds on my phone. It's just ridiculous. Please fix it.",
        "Garbage Crashes on the watch and on the Android Wear app. And doesn't stop pestering you to rate it 5 stars. So here you go, dev. You earned 1 star for being annoying. Maybe if the face worked you'd get more, but this was a waste of time.",
        "Spamming me to rate it? Here is an 1 star rating just to make it obvious how much I hate your tactics. Btw, I am considering paying but I won't because you've put more effort into the spamming compared to everything else.",
        "Doesn't look like screenshots without paying/demo Screenshots show dates and both black & white backgrounds. Date and white require an upgrade to pro version. No mention of this in app description. Might have paid but for the deceptive description.",
        "Forces you to review app 1 star for continuing to force a review even after I have said no ever and over.",
        "This app pesters me several times per day to leave a 5-star review."

        "Huge battery drain The watch faces look great, and I wish I could keep using it. But even with the frame rate set on clumsy my watch usually dies before the end of the day. Way too much of a battery hog for me.",
        "Looks great but... How do I get it to be low bit (black and white)? I have a g watch r and need it to have none of the gray background when inactive. The images show this in the play store, so I bought it, but how do I get it into this mode?!",
        "Great Good looks. Would be perfect if you somehow could add status bar info, and show time changing in seconds when screej is on. Would make me very happy!",
        "Really beatutiful watchface. I've been hunting for watches that really capture the Material Design asthetic, this is one of the best I've found so far.  Would love to see more options in display features (like date time formatting, etc).",
        "Battery drain Looks great and all, but it's a battery killer.",
        "Beautiful Great app.. Worth the money. Would be awesome if the ripple lasted 60 seconds so it could be used as a Minuite hand. I think it lasts 30 seconds at the moment."

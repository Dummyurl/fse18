        "Works great with LG G watch Was looking for a good watch face that wasn't too busy but at the same time had decent enough info. This hit the balance perfectly. Only thing I might change would be to lighten up the background a little. Even with the brightest setting on the watch, during the day, the background just looks black and you can't see any of the cool details. But that's a minor gripe. Don't let the low download count dissuade you. I whole heartedly recommend this.",
        "Really Good but... I really like this watch face.  It looks good and has a bunch of settings.  The only problem for me on my G Watch is that it runs choppy when I switch between the screens. Also it's not very battery friendly. I could still go through the day, but it definitely was using that battery.",
        "Can you fix the pedometer feature? I have a Samsung Galaxy Fear each and i purchased the premium version be cause the free version said you had to buy the premium version for that feature to work... I purchased this watch face as the round face by mistake and the steps were accurate but i wanted the square face version for my watch.. I got a refund on the round face and purchased the square face version but the steps on this version show 0 instead of what they should be.. The round face version The step counter worked correctly.. Can you fix?",
        "Love this watch face specially because I have a Sony smartwatch 3, one thing i really would like to see on all your watch faces is the option for Weather Underground as i have found them to be more accurate in my country :-)",
        "Love it, but... I love the animations and all the info! But how do I enable the 12 hour function? Also could you possibly make the weather font a little larger?",
        "Good job Works well with my Sony SW3, is that possible to add clock color support ? I mean the default color is white I prefer yellow or red. Thx"

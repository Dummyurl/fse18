        "Won't work. I have installed and reinstalled several times and I can only get one butterfly to show up, a green one. Nothing else. Tried to change on my watch (LG Urbane) and one the phone. Zip.",
        "Loved it",
        "Not animated. People will buy this thinking that it's animated like the Apple Watch. It's not. Not horrible pictures, but not anything special either."

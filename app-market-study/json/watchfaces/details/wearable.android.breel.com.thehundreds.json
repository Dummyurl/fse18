        "There are some awesome designs, but I don't like that the design partially overlaps the current time. It'd also be nice to have some extra customisation too.",

        "Love the designs, simple yet so unique",

        "No to bad",
        "Nice but lacking in terms of customization I haven't seen any other watch face using parallax scrolling hooked to the accelerometers. But I suppose that most Android users would like to change more than just 12/24h and random/static background. + for being free."

        "Great watchface...needs help.  The screen doesn't always dim properly...almost like it freezes up.  If a notification pops up and then dims it will be fine.  If it freezes, nothing updates on the screen which makes the time a bit inaccurate.  I really want to like this watchface but if it can't tell me the proper time when not \"active\" it is a bit worthless.  Huawei watch.",
        "Beautiful and functional. One of the best faces out there.",
        "Double setting icon Double setting icon on my watch face.",
        "Square please .. Looks cool.  Make it a square one and I will buy it in a minute.",

        "The best!  Except. .. It's animated and gorgeous. But the speeds settings don't stick. The rapid fire ads in setup are exceptionally annoying. I'd pay to rid them. Sometimes earth vanishes.  Sometimes digital time shows (even though it's off in settings). No time on dim screen.  I wish i could adjust the time before dim to 30, sec., as in Tourbibling. Fix all this for 5 stars.

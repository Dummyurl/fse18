        "Absolute perfection I wanted a minimalist look with some extra features, but every watch face I found seemed to either not be as customizable as I'd like or used low resolution watch hands/text and it was very noticeable to my perfectionist eye. This is truly the absolute best watch face app I have found for Android wear with the perfect amount of customizability as well as great visual aspects. Will never uninstall this face.",
        "Awesome This is the nuts. There is so much to choose from in the realms of customisation and the ambient lighting looks brilliant too. Good work. Only suggested improvement is; I cannot see how to add steps onto the circles - if you could do this, even better. Thanks",
        "Step counter is off by a magnitude of 10 Not sure what it is syncing with but it's saying 20k+ when all my other apps are saying 2k. The rest is fine, I was skeptical at first but you can really add your style and look unique yet classy.",
        "Some limitations Would be nice if the digital clock can be put in 24 hour mode. Also cards are translucent background which make them hard to read",
        "Constantly crashes on open. Used to be my favorite watch face, now the app doesn't even work.",
        "Was looking for a good watch face for last 1,5 month. I think I will stay with this one for a while.  I only hope that dev will provide support for complications (unleass it is already there)"

        "It's a sweet design but very hard to see the numbers unless you've just tilted your wrist to wake the screen the time lights up but then slowly hides within the camp design. Would be nice to have some more visibility such as a certain option to allow us to do this... (Sony SmartWatch 3)",
        "Great patterns and designs but can't tell the time... Still...Impossible to read lol",
        "Kool Works good on Ambient mode",
        "Pretty, but hard to read The purpose of a watch is to be able to tell time. Not to stare at for a minute trying to decypher it.",
        "No 12 hour option No option... 1 star!!!!",
        "Looks cool but.. The face looks great and I like the themes, but it's extremely difficult to read on my Moto 360. It would be great if there was an option to make the outlines around the numbers/date a bit more darker to make it easier to tell the time. Edit* upon further review the time and info do light up when you flick your wrist making it easy to ready, however this only seems to be the case when ambient mode is turned on. When ambient is turned off it doesn't seem to do this"

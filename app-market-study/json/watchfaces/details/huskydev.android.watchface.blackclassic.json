        "This app never shows the weather data, always it shows message as weather update started but it never shows.",
        "My watch seems to randomly change the brightness to very low since I installed the watch face. Don't think it is anything else so suspect a bug in the app",
        "Use it all the time",
        "Best face I've come across bar none",
        "Bought this app/watch face the day I got my Ticwatch E. I absolutely LOVE it! Very awesome, easy to use and very configurable. My only issue is that I am not sure what the Music Remote Control is or how to use it - and the documentation/help for this watch face is non-existent.",
        "The free version includes features that many watch faces charge for... The paid version is even better!"

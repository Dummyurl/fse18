        "Can't use. Moto 360 1st gen When the battery hits zero it will actually cause the watch to boot loop as it gets just enough power to boot and goes to the watch face, yet the face will cause the battery to drain faster than the charger can charge the battery. A cycle hard to get out of.",
        "Not a bad idea, has some potential but it's too basic for me. No options is a no-no for me",
        "Awesome watch face Awesome watch face love the look and everything works great just a little heavy on the watch battery for my taste!",

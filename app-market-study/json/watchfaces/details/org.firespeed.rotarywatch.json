        "Cool idea Needs work on the Moto 360. Please include an option to remove the numbers. If you could make the other rotors for hours and minutes appear \"behind\" the seconds instead of a \"ghost\" effect, that would look much better. Thank you for your hard work!",
        "Love the idea! Could you make an Android app or widget for my phone like this?  This would be a must have! Thanks.",
        "Galaxy I cannot get this on my galaxy gear 2 watch please help",
        "The words on the rotors are a little too much... But pretty cool idea!",
        "Cool idea but... Needs to be optimized for the moto 360.",

    "comments": [
        "Very nice watch face. May I ask for the following additions: 1. Allow numeric values. Sliders are tricky to sync between settings (e.g. minute and ticker lengths). 2. Allow HEX, RGB or any other color code where color inputs exist. Same reason as above.  3. Add width for tickers, same as there is such a setting for minute.",
        "Exactly what I wanted Digitalog was my favorite watchface for my GWatchR, but I always resented that all the minute ticks showed up with ambient mode. This app completely fixes that and add a bunch of customization. It's truly awesome!"

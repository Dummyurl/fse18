        "Looks great but lag makes it unusable Definitely one of the best looking and most unique watch faces around but going from ambient to active takes a few seconds then a few more seconds before \"Ok Google\" or touch interactions work. I am using an up to date Huawei Watch. Massive let down for a great looking watch face.",
        "Good, but not great for square Making the face use the full space of the square screen would be nice, instead of cropping it into a circle.",
        "Great looking watch but lags like hell, once that's fixed (and the resolution's raised a bit) this will easily be my everyday watch and get 5 stars.",
        "I think this is one of the best watch faces every, it looks so cool",
        "Great design! Really cool design. It took some time getting used to but I really love that it's one of the more unique Android watch faces!",
        "Awesome! Love this design. Just wish the ambient mode was the same cool design! Like maybe if only the relevant hour and minute pieces were visible, or maybe outlines or something."

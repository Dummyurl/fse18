        "It looks pretty, but it performs poorly, at least on my ZenWatch.  Its laggy, and the face is so small, that you can't see anything, because its a round face forced to fit screen on a square screen.  Description stated that this face is compatible with square watches, it most assuredly is not.",
        "So you can pay to unlock features. Oh and pay to go to the pro version. So $4.00 for a fully functional watch face. It's nice but it's not $4.00 nice.",

        "Fixed with quick response! I complained that the hands were not visible and the glow feature did not work and emailed the developer about this. With a quick reply he informed me about the bug in watchmaker and the fix for it.  Simply change your weather provider and change back, it will work perfectly then. This face was the reason I paid for the premium watchmaker app.",
        "Does not appear after install Looks very nice,  but the watchface does not appear on my phone/watch. Tried to uninstall and install few times - no good. LG G Watch R",
        "Beautiful but murder on battery As much as I love the look of this watchface, it absolutely kills my Moto 360 battery. I was lucky to get maybe 8 hours of run time with average use. I went back to Celestial 3D, which is equally gorgeous and my watch goes all day and into the night. I may use this watchface for special occasions, but never as a daily driver.",
        "Can't see time The watch hands are black on a black background not white as shown in the app. Not sure why but it's unreadable.",
        "Great Face Frank is the undisputed best face maker in the game.  If you've hung around the watchmaker app community you know every one is solid gold perfect every time.",
        "How to get it to work with Moto I had lots of trouble getting this to install until I followed directions :). You have to first download the watchmaker app and then install this app from your phone (using watchmaker)"

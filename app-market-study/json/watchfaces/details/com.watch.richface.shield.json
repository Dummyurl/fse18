        "Very nice face for the Huewei watch. Only hands when the screen is off. Otherwise shows day of week, battery of watch, battery of phone, temp, steps, and digital click under the analog for those who can't read watch hands.  Opening apps appears to only be a paid function. Another nice one is their Rolling Watch Face.",
        "stopwatch not working. a waste of money for a premium access. specially when the interactive feature does not seem to work. you have to force stop the app on your phone to regain the interactive functions.",
        "Still no support for Android Wear 2.0 Complications... And no response from dev... Disappointing...",
        "I wasn't willing to pay for a watch face. I did buy this one. No regrets",
        "Why doesn't the app picker show all the apps I have? And thr random colour toggling is very annoying. I think there is enough feedback here that something should be done.",
        "Really like this face. Accommodates everything I'm looking for on the main face.  My big complaint though is that the ambient hands on the black background are way too bright. They need to have configurable color for sure."

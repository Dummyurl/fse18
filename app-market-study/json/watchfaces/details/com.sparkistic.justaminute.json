        "Yes! 24hr mode has been added as an option. I was waiting for this and now the watch face has it, I've purchased Pro after being a free user for a good while.  Pleased with the customisable options which accompany the purchase. The only thing which saves the face getting a full 5 stars is subscription weather. I hear what the dev says about the quality, but could we not at least have the option of a no cost (but not as accurate) setting? Echo others in hoping complications are on route also.  Nice, clean, usable face - thanks.",
        "This is growing to be my favorite watchface, but the unfortunate lack of an option for translucent peek cards is steering me away from it (since I cannot see the date / battery and even the hour sometimes when I have a notification compared to other face watches). Would certainly love having this feature on my Moto 360!",
        "It's great. Please add option to display Realfeel temperature and current temperature on watch face not just condition. I hope complications are coming soon. Thank you",
        "My favorite watchface so far. I hope complications are on the roadmap!",
        "App caused screen ghosting (dead unfixable pixes). Otherwise loved it. Have both versions.",
        "Feature Request: I like your app very much, but I've request that please add an option in which we can place hour in place of minutes and vice versa, I'll give you 5 stars indeed. Thanks"

        "Really good, with a few suggestions. This watch face is really good! I have a few suggestions though:  1. Add an option to totally turn off the reflection, so it doesn't appear at all.  2. Add an option for the date where only the number for the day appears (like most other watches).  3. Add an option for all of the background to be pitch black.  4. Extend the green all the way to the very edge in the major tick marks. Right now those tick marks are half green and half white.  Cheers!",
        "I really like the way this watch face looks, however I continue to get Init UI error pop-ups like other reviewers here. It becomes pretty frustrating after awhile. My only other gripe is I wish there was a digital option along side the analog, as well as a battery percentage.  [Using a Moto 360 1st gen]",
        "Init UI error When you first select the face, it pops up an error saying \"Init UI error\" . I would not expect an error from a paid app.",
        "Looks great. Error on start I get the same ui error on start. Other than that I love the face.",
        "Very nice. Looks very simple and nice on my g watch R",

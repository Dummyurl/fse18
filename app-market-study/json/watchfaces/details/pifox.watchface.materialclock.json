The seconds hand swipes across the watch, the angle difference between the seconds and minutes creates a shadow area.And now you can have it on your wrist.Tap the face to cycle between 10 light colors.Easy to read and clean. It shows time, that is all. EnjoyIf you have any problems or suggestions, contact us: pifoxlab@gmail.com",

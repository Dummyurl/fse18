The time can be told in 12 and 24 hour modes.  The date is told in numerical format.  Red Tech panels fan out as you tell the time by turning on your smartwatch.  You can choose the color of the date and time text as well as the second indicator.When installing this watch face, be sure to install Android Wear from the google play store.  This will allow you to sync your watch with your smartphone.  Allow a moment for the watch face to install onto your smartwatch after downloading the app.",

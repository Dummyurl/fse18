        "I like the look and the fact you can change the colors, but it gets stuck and stops changing time. Also, when you go to change its look, it just stays the same. So now I feel like I should uninstall this since it's not serving its purpose. I have Moto Z Play if that helps.",
        "Looks great but there's a big bug! Thanks for the great widget dev! I like it but the last update causes the time to freeze on the widget. I couldn't notice a pattern or replicate the issue but I'm sure it's an easy fix. (On an Honor 8 - UK)",
        "Awesome This has instantly become one of my favorite widgets!  Becoming a fan of the developer,  keep up the great work. I would like to see the widget automatically change to match with the background. I have open the app for it to take this effect.",
        "Freezing at a point The look and feel is amazing. But it's not serving the main purpose. The clock gets strucked at some time and we need to remove the widget again to get it back into correct time. Please work it out",
        "No problems, no lag, nothing The LWP and daydream are flawless in my opinion. All I need to say is that when setting up the daydream, to prevent screen burn in, turn the background to pitch black and make the inactive color to pitch black as well. You can tap the area of a number to see it.",
        "Cool-looking Lots of color combinations to make, and it's great! One thing: is there a seconds time for the widget? If you add the seconds time for the widget, that would be great! And will increase to a 5-star rating too! ðŸ˜Š"

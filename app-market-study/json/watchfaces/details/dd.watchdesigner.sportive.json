        "Almost perfect I've been looking for a realistic watch face, and this one looks great on my Nixon Mission. I like the ambient options, but what's missing is a way to override the dim timer. As it is now, the watch face dims very quickly. I'd like to be able to set the timer to 7 or 10 seconds (as is an option in many other watch faces).",
        "Ok however To slow to download, how come I cannot change the color of the watch from red to different colors, to expensive, big mistake on my side, of course, I would like a refund",
        "Great design I use it exclusively with the ambient mode and it works great.",
        "Nice watch face! However, I would love to see a version without the red stripe. Also, for some reason the refund option was not available at the time of purchase."

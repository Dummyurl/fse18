        "Bug? Ambient mode doesn't show the seconds like in the preview screenshot even if I set it to show the full watch face so I'm guessing that's a bug. Also, could use the option to change the background color from dark grey to black in regular mode. No complaints other than that. It's beautiful, it's simple/minimalistic, and I haven't noticed any battery drain.",
        "Cluttering my app drawer It's a really nice looking watchface, but I'm not going to keep a watch face that goes against the guidelines and clutters my app drawer with an app icon for no reason. Android Wear supports watch face settings in the app or directly on the watch. There's no reason to do this.",
        "Don't trust the description It's a nice looking watchface albeit VERY simple. No room for customization except for 12/24hr mode and making seconds grey instead of white. Description says something about date and day of the week being visible on the face but I couldn't find such a setting at all!"

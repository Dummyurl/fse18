        "Looks really great on my Huawei 2. Highly customizable watchface, lots of information you can have displayed. If you have trouble getting it on your watch, it does take a bit, so be patient (I know 2017 and all, go outside maybe?). Well worth my 2 bucks.",
        "Had some difficulty getting this face onto my watch but well worth the trouble.  Really enjoy all the personalization options and it doesn't seem to hemorrhage battery power like some of the other faces I tried.",
        "Look, it's a gorgeous watch face, but I refunded because I only see the ambient display for about 3 seconds when I look at the watch. I have to stare at the face for  a while before the full watch face actually displays. If there's a setting I missed, or this is fixed, I will re-buy.",
        "Can see the face on my watch but have no settings available I also don't see any companion app on my phone to sync with, the design is nice but would like the customization for it.",
        "When using this face, connection between the phone and watch is not 100% in sync I don't have a problem with My other faces with this! S7edge with Sony sw3",
        "Nice... So once I figured out how to get all the features to work, its a nice watch face..."

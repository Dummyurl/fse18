    "description": "Chrono Watch Face for Android Wear has a clean and simple design while offering useful information at a glance.Feature list:- Battery levels of phone and wear- Date and Weekday- 12-hour mode supported (AM/PM)- Smart 24-hour display- Precise seconds- Explicitly crafted to prevent battery drain- Optimized to prevent screen burn-in - Samsung Gear Live monochrome mode- Customization options (setup on-the-fly)- Alternative watch face styles (more to come)The design has been crafted to be beautiful without any distractions. It is a hybrid between an analog and digital clock representation.The active screen has a circular design to display seconds. Hours and minutes are highlighted and are still visible in the always-on mode of devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Gear. The design of this watch face lends itself very well to always-on screens since the positioning is optimized to prevent screen burn-in.The watch face is 24 hour aware and switches the hours to 13-24 if needed.Battery information is displayed in an unobtrusive way: The battery level of the watch is displayed on the left side of the circle, while the battery level of the companion Android device is displayed on the right. As they battery level decreases, a small indicator bar moves from the top to the bottom of the circle.Chrono Watch Face was carefully designed to prevent unnecessary battery drain. In the dimmed screen mode, all background activity is stopped and only resumed when the watch is undimmed and woken again.This watch face is still in development and there will be a lot of updates in the coming days. It is planned to add a wide variety of customizations and some other surprise features, so check back regularly on Google Play.We hope you enjoy Chrono Watch Face!Feedback is welcome.

        "Impressive battery life Compared to most wear faces (and I've bought a lot and tried a lot of free ones)  this thing just sips on the battery. Dev, need steps please? Oh and I've just donated, it's worth it",
        "CWF Umm, something is not working, the app doesn't show up on the watch...and there is no tutorial or how to guide. Restarted the phone and the watch....any suggestions??? Update: response of Dev team is outstanding, as soon as the problem is fixed will give 5 stars...",
        "Great Simple yet effective.  Wish there was more customization but all in all a well rounded app",
        "Unusual Not the kind of watch face I'd usually go for but love this one.",
        "Not working Doesn't appear in wear app or on my Sony smart watch 3",
        "cool watch... some more settings? .. date format.. and maybe size.. ie lower numbers are off bottom slightly in moto 360..and time out :-)"

        "The concept is good but characters are way too big and bad colors choice needs work but good direction",
        "What a shame, could have been good!! The watch face has no order and some of the digital displays are over each other making it impossible to read, the seven segment display is in the wrong position on the watch, the face looks as if it is for a different type of watch when displayed on my Hauwei classic"

        "Fun for the holidays The hands could be a little bolder.  I have trouble seeing the time. (Odd thing is, the second hand is more visible than the hour or minute hand)",
        "Really Bad On a watch with an AMOLED screen like the Asus Zenwatch, the hands disappear into a confusing mess in dim mode. That makes it pretty much useless. Unfortunate.",
        "Festive, but... Can hardly read the time in ambient mode with everything white & the hands being so thin.",
        "Needs work. Great design and idea but sadly off centre with bottom half missing on my moto 360, but hey, it was free so can't knock it.",
        "Incorrect time Love the face but shows wrong time?",
        "LG G watch.  Works fine but the hands are so thin it is very hard to tell the time, cannot see the hour hand at all on the black and white image."

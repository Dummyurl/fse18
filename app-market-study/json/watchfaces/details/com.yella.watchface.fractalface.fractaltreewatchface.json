    "description": "ETree (Fractal Tree) watch face is a very unique and easy to use digital watch face designed for Android Wear. It is a one of a kind watch face, completely unique in its creation of a Fractal Tree, using the process of recursion with random values meaning each and every time it will be different from the last, with billions of possibilities.  This is no animated gif, but a true uniquely created fractal each and every time a it is created.Now re-sized to fit all watch resolutions both round and square.You can customize the watch face to either have a black and white tree with leaves, or a colored tree with leave and different colored fruit.You can even swap the seconds in the digital layout to show the battery status and have everything you need on the screen when you need it.Ambient mode is supported on both the ambient mode style watches. The Asus Zen will show a black and white pixel ambient mode, whilst other watches will show a black and white dimmed mode for battery saving.Key featuresAll settings are available using the Android Wear companion app (only).✔ Two animations to choose from✔ Two fonts to choose from, modern and themed✔ Custom colors for the Digital Time.✔ Works for round and square watches✔ Optional digital clock (24 hour or 12 hour, seconds are optional)✔ Watch battery indicator✔ Date indicator ✔Is not affected by the Moto flat tire✔Settings are accessed via Android Wear App, just tap on the cogwheel on the watch face.FAQ!!

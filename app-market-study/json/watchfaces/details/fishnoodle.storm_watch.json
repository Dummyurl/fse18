        "Works flawlessly with loads of personalization options! The Thunderstorm Watch Face - just like the matching \"live\" wallpaper from the same developer - looks incredible, has LOADS of options to configure the watchface to your personal preferences and works flawlessly. If you like your mobile devices sharing a common theme, or you just want something that looks particularly flash, the Thunderstorm Watch Face should be one of the very first watch-faces you look at!",
        "Meh. Just meh So ive been using this watch face since the day i got my watch but now switched on to something else.  Why? Well because its boring. Very very little things to change watch faces   needs a major update with different faces and better working battery level indicator. Its all great but not able to change things up.  Least when i have it on my phone its just ment to be a background show of lights to improve on just regular still pictures.   But watch. The watch face is the star.These are like indie movie stars",
        "Devs who respond ROCK! Originally gave this a 1 star due to crashes. Issue was fixed and the Dev responded! Rating has been updated!",
        "Samsung fit gear Couldn't get it to work. I really want it though if you get it to work with my gear I'll repurchase it. I love the background and would really like to match them.",

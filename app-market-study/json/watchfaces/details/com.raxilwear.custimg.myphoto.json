        "Can't find it Can't even find it on my phone so I can use it. Where is it?? Does not work or show up on my phone. Give me back my dollar!!",
        "It works well Excellent app!  I'd really like day and date options, to make these faces more watch like. I'd love a slideshow capability. Also, fix bug - app doesn't handle extra wide photos properly.  Then 5  stars.",
        "Nice App, Could be Better I like this app to personalize my watch with my pics, but I would like to see two options added: 1) Please give me the option for a digital face, or at least some extra info during ambient like bat power and date. 2) I would have loved it if I could pick a few pics at a time and the watch will periodically switch the pics automatically. However, for a dollar, I recommend it.",
        "Love it I wish I had more options for the actual watch function, but the upside of getting to make my watch face any pic I want is worth it.",
        "Great does the job Would like to see digital added though",
        "Fantastic This is a great app!"

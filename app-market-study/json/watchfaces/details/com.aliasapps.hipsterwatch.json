        "Nice graphics but background change isnt right The background changes, but it doesn't match the sunrise and sunset of the area you are in. Sunset was at 6pm, but background didn't switch to night until 9pm. A step counter display would be nice too",
        "Simple and awesome, good work. Thanks for listening and providing 12 hour format! Looking forward to more updates",
        "Fix the 24 Hours *Updated* I stand corrected. Thank you for the 12 hour format. It's now my favorite face.",
        "Most amazing watch face It just needs a 12 hour format option but I'm still using it for the moment even though it takes me a minute longer to know the time in the afternoon",
        "Watch face not centered I am using an LG G watch, and the time is not centered, cutting out part of the time. I love what it looks like, I just wish this would be fixed.",
        "Really great but.... Love it and will be using it daily but it needs a 24/12 hour toggle.  An option to hide the hearts in ambient or at least make them black and white."

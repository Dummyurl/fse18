        "I really like this watch face, but the most recent update added \"Vibrate every hour\"... after both the phone app and the watch app are updated, I can't turn that feature off, and it's driving me nuts.  I can't find an option for it on the watch, and in the app, I can turn it off.... but it doesn't turn off on the watch, and the next time I go into the app, it shows as \"on\" again.",
        "This skin is not showing in my Android Wear and my LG Urbane. Please let me know how to fix",
        "The weather setting is constantly showing me information from an island in the Pacific and I live in Alaska!",
        "The ability to see how I am doing today on steps is awesome! the design is clean and I smooth and the ability to change the color scheme at a touch is perfect for my ADD tendencies :)",
        "Classic clean design, thou there is battery's for watch & phone indicators, so I'll put instead of extra watch indicator, something else. (Heart beat or wind direction...)  For the rest I like it",
        "Thank you for the quick fix.  Works great!!!"

        "Great app",
        "It's pretty but is not possible to set it or to customize, even when you can access to the settings page. I was trying to change the background color or the orientation directly from the watch, and it wasn't possible. When you tap in the buttons nothing happens.",
        "Slick looking watch face. I have two issues though. First, the animation is nice but it takes so long that the screen goes into dim/ambient mode directly after displaying the time. Second, when you change the orientation to horizontal the ambient mode stays vertical. If the timeout was longer and orientation worked properly then this would be a perfect face.",
        "It's great. But the settings needs some work. Know what is horizontal n vertical please.",
        "Muito bom Muito bonita, mas n√£o consegui alterar o designer",
        "Awesome face design, love it... Maybe the time can be a little bigger for quick glances"

        "Awesome First time couldn't find it in Android wear so I uninstalled and tried again. Worked. Looks F A N T A S T I C on my Moto 360. We'll see how it affects battery life, I'll update my review later. So far it's worth it. ************************** UPDATE: AFTER MOVING TO 5.1.1 I HAVE TWO \"FLAT TIRE\" ISSUES INSTEAD OF JUST THE ONE AND THE PARALAX EFFECT IS GONE.  Please address. Is it still a Motorola issue six months later?",
        "Awesome Makes the Sony smartwatch 3 look really futuristic. Your wallpapers are amazing and now android wear brilliant. It's like your in my head with your designs. I can confirm zero battery drain on sw3.",
        "Really like using this! I noticed a considerable amount of battery drain from this one but I love everything this group puts out. I have not had my moto360 die before I get home from work after a 10 hour day but it is in desperate need of the charger. Still a great face.",
        "Was my favorite until Flat tire is on top and it doesn't respond to the motion sensors.   Who's to blame android wear or...  please fix.",
        "Out of alignment with my watch. Can't see the analoge properly and there's a black bar across the top of the screen. Don't buy this if you have a Fossil watch!",
        "Immediate problems dawg! Edit Guess I was wrong, you haven't fixed it yet. It's been months now, got a replacement watch this week after waiting 5 weeks and this app still don't work right. The face on the moto is way off Center. The date and minute indicators are all a lot lower than they should be. Can't read the date due to being down into the dead spot and the minute second arrows are about a 3rd of the way down to the center of the watch. Uninstalling! This app runs on the phone all the time even when not applied also!"

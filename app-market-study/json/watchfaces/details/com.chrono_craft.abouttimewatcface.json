        "Looks good but I'd like to see some options: set ambient mode same as lit face (just without movement), multiple backgrounds (e.g. black, gray and white) and color themes.",
        "Bad ambient mode Watch face a bit too small for lg watch. Ambient mode just plain not well designed.",
        "Can be improved The ambient mode is what people will see most of the time when they look at their watch. If you guys can make the ambient mode the same as the face when the watch is active (without animations) I would give it 5 stars. Look at the ranger watch face for example which ambient mode is almost as good as the face when the watch is active",
        "too small! looks bad on lg g watch r Doesn't look good like the photo's in play store!",

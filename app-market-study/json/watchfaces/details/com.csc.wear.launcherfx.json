        "The laucher works good.. I didn't get the app,to work on the phone it stayed stuck on loading screen BUT The app will install in the watch. Hit the button on the watch and it will bring up the menu run  wear launcher or android wear. Select laucher you will the laucher. I like that you can have apps on the home screen, and uninstalling apps from the watch is a plus. 3 apps shortcuts will show up on face but you can add more and scroll on icons",
        "Confusing It says I can use it with my own watch face, but how? I set my watch face and the only way I can get this launcher back is to press the button on my watch, then my watch face is gone and I have to set it again. Maybe I'm stupid, or maybe it's just the way it is, who knows, nothing in the app to explain it.",
        "It deserves a try",
        "doesn't work. sent email for help. no response yet.",
        "It's cool. It's a great concept, but it lacks notification support and the lockscreen settings crashes, LG G Watch, 6.0.1 M1D64S."

        "Loved this app, I paid for the premium version.  Compass does not work but neither do other compass apps for my Huawei watch.  I particularly like the customisable widget shortcuts which appear on the watch face. I wish the hands were more distinctive on the analogue face, otherwise highly recommended.",
        "I have premium and like the watch face.  It is missing a couple of things. It should include some of the features like Ultra Watch Face. Unread messages and calls. And the shortcuts that are available to choose from are very limited. I would like to be able to set a shortcut to the phone on the watch and cannot.",
        "Not sure what's wrong but it keeps stopping. Shame. Hopefully developers have a fix.....looks like it could be good, and I've paid for premium tooðŸ¤”",
        "The weather part does not work, stock on celsius.",
        "Wouldn't work at all on Zenwatch with Android Wear 2.0",
        "Wanted to try premium... Do I have to download premium from the watch or can I do it on my phone through playstore?"

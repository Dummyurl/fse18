    "comments": [
        "Good Great colors on the black/grey, the rainbow looks childish. However it doesn't seem sharp or crisp looking on the moto 360. Also, the gears take a while sometimes to pop-up after coming out of ambient mode, otherwise great watch face.",
        "Good one. Came here from Libraries for Developers. The watch face is very good. Any chance of square layout?",
        "Looks like in pics!",
        "numbers look blurry I love this concept and the colors, but it looks unpolished and blurry.",
        "Great potential but like a few other comments I saw needs more detail and color choices.",
        "Doesn't work with the LG Urbane - no sleep mode or notifications. It looks great but could use some tweaking, or ability to change colors."

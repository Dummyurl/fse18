        "Excellent Watch Face This is my go-to watch face. It looks fantastic, especially in ambient mode.  Most watch faces look terrible in ambient mode, but not this one. I even like the blue glow that indicates the hour. It would be perfect if you could see exact battery percentages instead of the tiny meters. Removing a star until battery percentages are numbered.",
        "Average Just average. It doesn't look premium. More watch face makers need to try to get as close to premium watch face design as possible. Look at Tag, Rolex, Omega, Breitling, etc and go from there. These watchfaces are cartoonish and childish in comparison. Not every tech guy is a nerd. Some actually have style and class.",
        "Good looking, but disappointed that you cannot change the date format.  I would like to be able to show \"VEN, 8 JANV\" on just one line without the year... but I cannot.  Now it shows \"8 VEN. JANV2016\" on 2 lines which is difficult to read.",
        "Battery life stinks Why is the battery life so bad? After 8 hours I have 6% of life left. I love the face, but it's unusable.",
        "Dual watch Synch confusing and dual time doesn't easily save. Once set is a good option.",
        "Great watch face, but since update in December the update weather button does not work. It will be 40 degrees but the watch shows 21 degrees (on all three weather sources). Go to watch page on phone and you can't press the update button.  I can on other interactive watch faces but not on Dual Watch Face."

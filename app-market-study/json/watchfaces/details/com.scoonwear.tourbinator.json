        "Good try poor execution Face will crash occasionally if I set the display time to anything other than 5 seconds. Also both passive mode faces look really really bad. Should have stuck with simple full size hands.",
        "Waste of space Too busy and cluttered to make out.   Nice Idea, but poorly designed.",
        "I never got to use it one time. I was billed for it but never once seen anything. Poor business Must be a rip off",
        "Paid for a what I thought was a cool watch face turns out to be the disappearing watch face never made it to phone or watch.....so basically I gave away my hard earned money, guess that's the way it works disappointment is the word for this one, no refund button either.",

        "Great watch face !!! Looks great on watch, I wish there was a little more customization for colors and tap feature but overall great !! Thanks",
        "Looks Great Straightforward but great looking on my Huawei.  Less is more.",
        "Great looking.",
        "Absolutely gorgeous face.  The detail and clarity of the visual elements is incredible, and the expert use of shadow effects really lends a powerful sense of depth to this face. This is one of the more realistic faces I've encountered, and I've tried a lot. The dev is also very responsive to feedback and was very quick to implement a toggle for the bezel at my request. Thanks!",
        "Looks fairly good on the urbane... I don't know if it's an optical illusion or a problem, but the watch face looks slightly off-kilter on the LG urbane."

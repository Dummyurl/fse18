        "Nice face. But it didn't look great on my LG G WATCH R because of the bezel. Face has its own bezel, so looks to much. Had to go back to Shield face.",
        "Now that the steps meter works it is almost perfect... Give some option for smaller numbers and dofrent design and it will be the best ever watch face!!",
        "Doesn't work with Samsung s3 Frontier. Can not get it to work. Paid for the premium version and need my money back.",
        "Googled for watch faces for Gear s3 frontier this came up I installed and paid premium but doesn't work with gear watches this is not clear. Can I have my money back please.",
        "Oh man this face is absolutely fantastic. I immediately purchased the premium because of all it offers. I use it all, we'll designed. I love the high-tech complexity of the look but is also so easy to read all the information. Has everything I wanted for my Huawei 2 Classic.",
        "I have also paid premium on this and can't get it to work on Samsung S3 Classic there is no way to send to face to my watch"

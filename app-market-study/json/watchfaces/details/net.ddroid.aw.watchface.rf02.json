        "Great watch face! I love the battery indicators, and the choice for color in ambient mode. This is very important, as blue pixels wear out faster than other colors in OLED. I therefore use the yellow ambient mode.  Speaking of which, since the G watch R doesn't have a light sensor, it would be even greater if the face could bump up the ambient screen brightness during the day (set the start/stop time in the software, or let it depend on sunset/rise reported by google). That'd be super!",
        "Weather off Great design but won't buy any more until they did the inaccurate weather. Great design but won't buy any more until they fix the inaccurate weather.",

        "World like to be able to disable the redundant compass markings around the edge...",
        "Looks awesome. Battery hog Undoubtedly one of the coolest wear watch faces. Too bad it cuts my watch battery life by more than half and uses wayyy more phone battery. First time I've seen Bluetooth as top battery consumer."

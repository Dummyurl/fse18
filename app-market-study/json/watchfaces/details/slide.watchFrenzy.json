        "So far, I'm impressed. I just don't understand if all watch faces have (or if we can somehow activate in the app) the burn-in protection for OLED screens. Let me know!",
        "Now that I have spent a little more time working with the app, I love it. I admit that I got frustrated at first, but a few Google searches and i was able to resolve my issues.  Looking forward to playing with this more.",
        "Worst app ever. Forces you to download some hidden \"Samsung Billing\" app that constantly gives a pop-up error. Most of the faces are paid items, even after paying for the app.",
        "Awesome app. I'm 40 and I play with this thing all the time! It even quenches the developer and designer thirsts in it",
        "App needs help info. Easy to use after you get it figured out. Where is the manual?",
        "LOADS of faces available from the G+ group, more than you could possibly need. Excellent app and I haven't even tried to make my own face yet."

        "Gorgeous face. Would rate 5 if it had ambient face customisation. My only gripe with this face is that it doesn't have any ambient screen customisation like the meteor face (by the same developers) does. I would love to have the option of making it grey if that would be possible. Aside from that, well worth the money. :)",
        "This company is a very pro-active company in Instagram. They gave me a free code to use their watch face and it is just beautiful. Like an active screen saver for the watch, it gives you details that you need such as the time and battery life. Moving parts like meteor showers and a moon orbiting the planet add a little charm to this watch face. Thanks you again Peppy Works.",

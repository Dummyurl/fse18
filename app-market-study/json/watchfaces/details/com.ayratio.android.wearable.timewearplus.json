        "The Best!!! This is my 1st review of an app... TimeWear Plus is by far the best timer app for any type of exercise.  I do Not have to have my phone with me on the gym floor,  Yaaaa!!!!  The developers are Awesome and respond and take into account any questions and suggestions.",
        "Perfect for my smartwatch Does exactly what I need. I use it on my Moto360 for air pistol practice and matches. Needed multiple presets for different types of exercises. Run this timer for 90 mins (match duration) - no negative impact on my watch battery. I like that I still get all my email and Google Now notifications while running the timer. Would be nice to have an option to change vibration when the timer ends.",

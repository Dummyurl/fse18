        "Stumbled upon this yesterday and love it so far!  Has a nice simple design but has all of the features I like.  Has lots of customization!   the notification mode in ambient mode is brilliant.  Great work!  A+ The only thing I would love to have would be some kind of animated background.. but I am NOT gonna get picky!  :)",
        "Really like the watch face. But I have been noticing some pixel burn-in on my LG Watch Urbane so if you could add a feature so that the elements of the watch face (clock, complications etc) move around every so often to prevent pixel burn-in I will rate the app 5 stars! Thank you in advance and keep up the good work!  UPDATE: a reboot fixed it. I will rate the app 5 stars because it was not your fault and for the fast response! Keep up the good work! I might donate as well :)",
        "Fantastic watch face. After hours of digging through the garbage in the Store, I was delighted to find this gem.  I usually prefer digital clocks to the analog ones, but this Digilog thing is quite unique and actually easy to read while saving the minute marks engraved on the bezel of my watch from being redundant. Moreover, it remains mostly unchanged in the ambient mode, which is something many other watch faces can't brag about.  It also offers personalization using the standard watch face tools and without all the overly-custom nonsense.",
        "It works the way my mind works.  I initially want to know the hour, and it gives me that without thinking.  Then I get to engage my brain a little bit a \"figure out\" the minutes.   Many times I only want to know roughly what hour it is during the day.  This allows me to know the general time at a quick glance, but also the minutes if I so choose to look and think a little more.  The complication are good if you want them.  Personally I just like the date.   Wishes? 1.) I wish the app complication would not be in color on the main screen but just greyscale (like the date)  2.) Options to change the size and font of the middle digit.  (neither of these is worth giving it less than 5 stars though, excellent job Seahorsepip !!!!!)",
        "Would like the possibility to have two \"large\" complications.  Right now only the bottom area supports large complications.  Glad to have found a watch face supporting 2.0 complications though :)",
        "This is a daily driver for me. However, I do have my own set of complaints. The ambient is kinda dim, with no way to make just the ambient brighter( and I know this can be done, as I have seen some crappy watch faces include this feature), and also I haven't found a way to make the battery complication look big like it does in the play store screenshots. However, apart from these things, this is one of the absolute best free watch faces, and one I would pay a premium for. Great work!!"

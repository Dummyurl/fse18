        "Hi! I have only one question. You guys made really nice watch faces. But I am not that reach to buy every single of them. You don't have any premium account that we can buy once and we can use other faces also?",
        "Up graded to premium and now the watch face does not illuminate with the second hand. Tried to uninstall and re-download no change.  Found it, had show goals instead of seconds checked.",
        "It seem like stat or all those google fit sync not working for current day...already try activate google fit but still show 0...switch to other face then working fine...",
        "I purchased premium but my weather forecast doesnt work. Let me know if someone can help.",
        "Seller said that watch long hands will be remove next update but few time update didn't removed, very disappointed. Long hands blocking the date and all important features. Wave my money didn't use at my watch."

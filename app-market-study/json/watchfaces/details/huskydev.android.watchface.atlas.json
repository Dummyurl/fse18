        "This is a very impressive face.  Besides an original and beautiful face, the customization features are better than those of any of the other 20 or 30 faces I have collected.",
        "Generally a good watch face.  A few minor bugs that have not been addressed in the latest updates, but still worth using on my watch.",
        "Another fantastic watch face the only downside is that it doesn't have all the options that the real weather watch face has keep up the great work 👌👍",

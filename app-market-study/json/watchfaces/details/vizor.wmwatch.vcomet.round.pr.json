        "Great watch face... Watchmaker needs to support remembering user settings I really do enjoy this watch face. Whilst it is a current limitation with the Watchmaker platform, it'd be nice if I didn't have to keep setting it back to 12 hour mode after each watch restart or face change. I've left feedback to that effect on the Watchmaker Premium app. Looking forward to more from this dev.",
        "I can give 5 if... I can give 5 stars if you can change the compass by the weather wind direction and move it to extend weather screen. For those with a Moto 360, like me, compass is useless because our device does not have one. You could release the result  like update and you will get 5 *****. I can also pay for a specific Moto 360 version with that change. No need to refund the current one. Hope you can make it. Thanks.",
        "Good watch, some annoyances I love the watch face. I would like to disable the added touch spots for the compass since it seems to get pushed a lot. Also, in 12h mode, the 12 shows as 0 not 12. Please fix.",
        "the best watch face I've found so far. Suits my LG Urbane perfectly. icons are easily distinguishable which makes it easier to read the watch with a quick glimpse. Compass is perfect and very useful for me. I have a few suggestions. It'd be great if you can implement them. I am ready to donate a modest amount and 5 stars :) It's very smart to have different sections for different categories such as weather, fitness and calendar. Can you integrate the following: Missed calls and unread messages in the calendar section with tiny interactive icons next to the calendar section to alert the user. Wind speed and direction etc in the weather section One of the most important features for fisherman like me is tide times and swell data, can this be integrated? Nobody has got this. You can be the first! You can have another section such as \"outdoor\" and this would have moon data including moon down and up, sunrise and sunset, tide times and heights, swell data (tide times and swell is very important for surfers and sailors as well). Compass can be moved here too. Then the fitness would have constant/on demand heart rate monitoring, stop watch, steps etc You can do it!!! Please!!! :)",
        "Simply amazing I rarely give reviews, but this watchface is far beyond any other. I have spent hours upon hours on the play store, forums and so on, but no other watch even comes close to this masterpiece. I do have a tiny wish/request - I would love the watchface to display the current week number (perhaps implemented as a user choice in the watchface settings)",
        "Almost perfect Only flaw I have problems with is the event at the bottom. The moto 360 only brings up the app drawer when u swipe either the top or bottom so if u swipe the middle almost all the time it will seem like the watch is lagging. In this watchface only the top part works because the bottom keeps opening the event tab. Other than that I love this watch face. Especially the weather tab. Beautiful animations all around.....UPDATE, ok now I have a problem...a big one. I change the time from 24 to12 and it won't stay"

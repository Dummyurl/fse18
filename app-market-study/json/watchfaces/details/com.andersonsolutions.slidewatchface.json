        "Great idea Would prefer more solid or gradient color backgrounds, the ones supplied can make numbers hard to read, but love the animated numbers and choice of horizontal or vertical",
        "Beautiful Watch Face I have many watch faces for my Moto 360, but this is fast becoming my favorite \"go to\" dial.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",
        "Nice Like the way the time is displayed. Wish there were solid black and White background options. Solid black with red & white numbers. Off-white with red & gray numbers. Nice face.",
        "Looks great! Simple yet configurable and the animations look amazing."

Long press the watch face and click the little gear icon at the bottom to configure watch face colors and toggle 12 / 24 hour mode.The watch face supports both burn-in protection and low-bit mode for watches that use these.Troubleshooting:Sometimes it takes a little while to install new watch faces over a slow Bluetooth connection. Wait at least a few minutes after installing on phone, by then watch face should be installed on the watch as well. Try reinstalling or re-syncing all apps to the watch if it still fails. This unfortunately affects all third party watch faces on Android Wear.Sources are available at:https://github.com/FruitieX/ArcWatchSuggestions and feature requests are welcome!",

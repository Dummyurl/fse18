        "I really like the look of this watch face. The bright red hands and white lettering are in sharp contrast with the black background. However, the step count does not work. It worked for one day when I downloaded it but then it's always showing 0. Also, the weather information does not get updated in a regular interval. Sometimes,it shows the weather of previous day. I still use it because of sharp design and readability.",
        "Update removed the solid black background? This used to be the best-looking watch face ever! Incredibly disappointing‚ÄºÔ∏è Even the paid version doesn't have a solid black backgroundüò¢",
        "After update it doesn't work on my Huawei Watch 1 anymore. Phone is Google Nexus 6P",
        "Before the updates this apps has the smooth sweeping option for the hand on the second now no more. Please bring it back. Thanks",
        "I like this watch face for my sony smart watch. It looks very good and shows all the parameters I normally need at a glance.",
        "What happened to the continous sweep. I was just about to buy this and they take it out??"

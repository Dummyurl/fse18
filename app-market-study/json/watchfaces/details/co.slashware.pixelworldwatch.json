        "At last, you are asleep For three nights, each attempt to sleep has brought you starting from your bed in fright, with no memory of what horrified you so.                               With a sickening sense of deja vu, you begin to dream. You try to wake, but tonight the ghostly eyes captivate you.  \"Treachery and doom! Â My brother would unleash a great evil upon us. Britannia is in peril!\"",
        "Requested change Looks pretty, but since the time is at the bottom it gets covered up by the notification shade which often appears there. Of this could be fixed, this would be my default watch face. As it is now, I cannot use it because I am unable to glance at the time without using a hand which undoes the whole purpose of a watch. If this is changed I will redo this review. Thanks.",
        "Request! Overall I love the nostalgia but I much prefer a 12 hour clock cycle. Any plans to add it in? I don't see any settings associated with the watch face yet so I'm assuming it's 24 hour only right now."

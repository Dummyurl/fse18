        "Nice work. But could you remove the 'Digital 2.0' words in the corner? If you can, I will give you 4 stars. If you could give me an option to change the color, I will give you 5 stars!  I don't think it's bribing you. It's encouragement. When I installed it, there was no way to remove the words 'Digital 2.0' in the corner. That's why I wrote this review. I didn't update my review because I uninstall this watchface several days after I posted this review and didn't get any response. In order to fulfill my promise, I installed it again and yes, it's gone now. Now you have 4 stars."

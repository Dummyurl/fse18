        "The Best (Moto360) You guys have the best watch faces on the play store keep it up.",
        "IMO, This is the best watch face app So, I know it sucks to have to pay for faces, but a dollar per face really isn't that bad. I mean if you download a face just to realize you don't like it, just refund it. ALSO, you can change up the brightness, colors, °C/°F etc without the trouble of editing a bunch of crap.   Easy to navigate through since it's all categorized from moto360, LG G-R, and Square face watches,  etc.",
        "Great Love it, perfect for Moto360. Have one complaint temperature is always 10 to15 degrees lower than actual"

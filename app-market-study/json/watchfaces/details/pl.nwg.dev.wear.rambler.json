    "description": "This application allows to use data in GPX (GPS eXchange) format, such as routes and POI (Points Of Interest), for navigation purposes on Android Wear smart watches. It comes with a free, open source companion app (you'll be prompted to install), which allows to prepare your own routes and POI. You can also take advantage of the large base of bicycle and hiking GPX trails available on the Internet, or convert GPX tracks from your activity tracker into routes.The application offers two watch faces to choose from. Besides telling time, they display full set of navigation data: direction pointer, route point hints, and more in configurable screen widgets: speed, average speed, maximum speed, speed made good, estimated time en route, estimated time of arrival, time elapsed, distance made, time and date, altitude, steps counter, time of sunrise, time of sunset, time to sunrise, time to sunset, heading, bearing, and distance off course. Choose 8 of them to use in the Classic watch face or define 3 switchable sets of 4 widgets in the Active watch face.The application works great as a cyclocomputer, but may become your companion during any other outdoor activity, as a useful addition to activity trackers. It also stores basic stats on time, speed and distance.Supported languages:EnglishGermanPolishMore info you'll find in the manual at http://dev.nwg.pl/rambler-user-guide.In the free version you'll only be able to store 5 POI and 3 routes on the watch at a time.

        "Great App for long walks (Ramblers) The classic watch face works perfectly for me on my walks / runs. The watch face widgets can be configured to your liking.  Please read the manual first, it is well written. I was able to setup the watch face easily.  I am using this app with a Asus Zen Watch 1, without any issues.",
        "Istimewag",
        "App stopped working. App stopped working after update today. Watch face is sent to watch but that's how far it gets. Nothing can be accessed on phone, setting cannot be changed etc. Please fix.",
        "Neat Looks good on a gear live. Unfortunately, the companion phone app isn't in the menu on my Nexus 5.  UPDATE: Now I know how to get to the settings, it's working great. Very light on battery when not navigating too.",
        "Watchface with the personality of a full blown navigational APP More navigational features than in all but the top of the line big brand name GPS sportswatches.",
        "Great watch face for the SW3 Great face with loads of functions. My only challenge is calibrating the compass."

    "recentChanges": [
        "GXP edition moved to the external Rambler GPX Editor (open source). Manual route point hints abandoned (all the route point hints generated automatically). Navigation to POI includes a bonus feature: you can ask the OSRM Demo Server for a route. Google Maps replaced with the OpenStreetMap."

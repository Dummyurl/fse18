        "Love! I really love this watch face. The backgrounds are nice. Updated to 5 stars for fixing the battery drain. Cannot stop looking at this beautiful watchface!",
        "Pretty but Kills battery. Edit..maybe you fixed the watchface battery, but none of faces I liked are there.   Not what I paid for.",
        "Battery drain Faces looks great, however battery drain is too much...even after \"fix\".",
        "Nice watch faces but sucks watch battery like there is no tomorrow. Less than 8h on my old LG when others last almost 2 days.",
        "Very cute watch faces I think Santa stuck in the chimney is my favorite. :)",
        "Much better Much better after snow animation was turned off. Now add an option to edit text font and this is perfect."

        "Love the face. Need a fix for ambient mode though. Numbers show up fine, but no hands. Maybe it's black on black? (Edit: super awesome quick response. Perfect now)",
        "Looks good - No Ambient mode It looks really good, I just wish it had ambient mode. The majority of androidwear watches have an AMOLED display and it would be a great addition along with a digital mode. :)",

        "Barebones neatly designed Simon! Clean-cut, simply works, embodies the original.   --Only thing: Would be nice to have 'Confirm Exit' (or similar) on back key press; lost a high score by accidentally backing out- and app session restarted :/",
        "This game on Sony Smartwatch 3 (square screen)  is broken. The buttons are all weirdly placed on the screen. Too bad :c Also the game shows unnecessary notifications. Can you please write me once you fix the issue with square devices? Thank you.",

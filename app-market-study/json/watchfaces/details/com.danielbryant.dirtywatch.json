        "Wish it had more variation to it. Gets old really fast and seems to drain my battery bigtime. Before it I was still around 60% at the end of the day, now I'm 10% or less.",
        "I love it so much!!! I JUST WISH IT WOULD BE CENTERED WHEN THERE'S THREE LINES OF TEXT!!!!! ITS KILLING ME.",

        "Very well done. Battery life extended to two days on my Huawei. Needs to have an option to disable ambient mode. During the day, it's next to impossible to see. Could you add a new option for this date format? \"Tue/Feb 10/2017\". Would also be nice to have the seconds counter as well.",
        "Overall I like it. I wanted a minimal digital watch face. The only thing I don't care for is the date format you can't change. I'm not European/Asian, so I would prefer the North American format (MM/DD/YY).",
        "\"Perfect & Works Great w/ Samsung Live gear!\" It is just what I have been looking for. The app displays the time, battery, and the date, with allowing me to choose the color  (mine is hot pink, right now, Lol!!). Thanks, I am very pleased with this app! ðŸ˜Š",
        "May be one of my favorite minimalist watch faces. Hardly used any battery. There is options to change color and date format. The battery bar is a nice touch. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a simple watchface.",
        "Brilliant. Love the minimal look and the battery curve is genius. Lots of configurable options from the Huawei watch app, including date formatt for you weird Americans. Would have preferred a solid white font for the dim view though, instead of wire frame.",
        "I use this app on my moto 360 1st gen. I just purchase new   Smartwatch huawei 2gen and I like to app so much I switched it over it's the only one that I use and whatever color I have on I change color. Great app plan and simple that's all I was looking for."

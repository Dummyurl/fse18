        "My original evaluation was overwhelmingly poor due to the stinging response received from the developer.  Another developer helped me to to not only fix their, but their solution helped me to fix Photo Shop Pro. This is a good app, but support stinks. Therefore 4 stars instead of 5.  I chalk this off to a poor understanding of culture and  angery frustration due to the developer's inability to communicate.",
        "App does not work with Fossil Q and Galaxy s7. When you select the photo you want to send to my Fossil Q smartwatch. It does nothing. I read the comments about the app not working with the Gear s2 or s3, but not with the Fossil Q. Could not reach any support forum on the issue as well.",
        "Could you please tell me how to rotate my pictures? I've clicked on everything in the app and I still haven't been able to figure it out. Majority of the pictures I choose come out sideways even though they aren't that way in my gallery.",
        "[Sony smartwatch 3] Nice and simple way of selecting a photo from your phone (or Google photos) to display as your wallpaper on watch face. For five stars I would love to see it change pictures each morning.",
        "Ugraded my watch  it did not go to it try to rebuy it it would let cause said already have the ab can't  put my pictures  back on phone uggg",
        "Doesn't work I bought this program TWICE (one for the watch S2 & one for the cell s7) and I still can't make it work. On the watch will not give me no type of options besides the minus sign and on the s7 I choose the picture click on the choices on top of the app and it doesn't do absolutely nothing. I'm so upset right now!!"

        "I like this very much. But... Hello, I like this watchface very much. The ambient mode works very well so well in fact that I usually dont use it but it looks cool with this watchface. However there is one minor hiccup, the \"clock face\" toggle doesnt seem to do anything on my moto 360 v2. It seems to not make a difference in ambient or full power mode.          Update: Dev contacted me after I reported a small issue on moto 360 this has been fixed so as promised I have upped my rating to 5 stars. Good support and good communications.",
        "JUNK Enough said!",
        "Very nice concept and attractive watch face.  Does exactly what it should do!",
        "Never showed up in my phone to even use. Looks great in the photo. Once downloaded, it shows installed but not accessible in any way."

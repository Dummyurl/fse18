        "I really like the minimalism of this watch face, especially when the thickness is turned very low. It use this one as an alternative to the Essential face. The inactive state is maybe almost too simple, but I don't see how it could be improved. My favourite detail is how the animated second bars break around the edge of the glass on Moto 360 - not sure you get the same effect on other watches. One minor nuisance: a \"init UI error\" is displayed when I switch to this face, but it only shows once.",
        "Very classy but needs more options All the usual options needed: Date formatting, weather, lose leading zero in hours in 12 hour format, adjustable full brightness time length, add : between hour : minutes, fonts, colors. In general though, the beginning of a very nice face.",
        "Settings are unstable. They don't remember what you previously entered so when you go back to tweak something, it resets everything. Also the date isn't visible in ambient mode. And to top it all off, the animations are choppy. Not a good face.",
        "Why does it go to 24? I loved the older version, but this yellow version with lines in the side is ugly to me. And what's up witj going to 24, when it should be 00, that's just strange.",
        "One of the best watch faces out there Would be nice to choose a different colour but nice none the less. Also to turn off the lines around the outside.",
        "Great design Love the font thickness option. Could a color option be in the next update? Personally not a fan of the yellow. But looks great nonetheless."

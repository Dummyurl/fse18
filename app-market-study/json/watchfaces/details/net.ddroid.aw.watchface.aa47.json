        "I would be happy if I could have full time ambiant mode but also a little brighter... Shoot wait.. I did find that.. 5 stars!",
        "Waste of money Paid for the watch face and it worked beautifully until I switched from and back to  the face. Now it no longer syncs and surprise surprise, there's a new version of the face (that I would have to pay for). For shame!",
        "Everything I need Except The ability to customize it with different colors for my outfits. Fix that and you get 5 *",
        "Great watch face 👌👌👌",
        "Best idea ever! Okay, so I don't need to know the wind speed and really don't care if the moon or Sun will come up or not. Everything including temperature, humidity, it's very easy to tell what your battery level is in the phone and on the watch. I was a bit disappointed when clouds showed up on my watch but it was a clear sky. Somehow that changed and now it's correct. It does suck up some battery,  Outstanding!  Ok one small con. Uses 9% battery while idle. I have to charge daily instead of every two days",
        "Almost perfect. The only thing I would like is a feels like temperature instead of the actual temperature. Please include this if possible."

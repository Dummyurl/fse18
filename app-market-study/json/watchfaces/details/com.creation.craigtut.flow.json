        "Keeps telling me to \"install settings app\" and takes me back to this page. There is no additional settings app to install, I don't know where it is and I'm stuck with the default colour",
        "Very good As others have mentioned, a few more colour options would be nice, as well as different background colours (eg, white/greys), as the colour diversity doesn't quite match the price. Overall though a very smooth and clean looking design",
        "Looks nice but because the colors are so similar you can't use it in light. More color options are needed",
        "Great!",
        "Just a bit more work... Can't wait for the more color options to come out. However, it would be a lot nice if the time went closer to the edges of the display. It feels a little bit like it's adding an excessive border.",
        "Not great Doesn't fit the g watch r very well. Should skirt around the outside of the screen"

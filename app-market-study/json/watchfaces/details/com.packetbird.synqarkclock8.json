        "Looks great! Looks great on my Moto 360. Rated 4 stars, but with a couple improvements, could be a 5 star rating. First, the dial markers (minute ticks around face) could be a little bolder. Most colors wash into the background. Second, an adjustable screen on time. A couple other watch faces have recently added this, and it is a very nice addition.",
        "Looks cool. Needs a bit more customization. I see some people complaining about the battery drain. I feel it's because of the inability to disable to animations. While I think the pulse and second animations look cool, they are a massive strain on the battery. The ability to disable those, not just make them transparent, would be manor boost for the watchface. Being able to resize the text would be helpful as well.",
        "Ambient Bug The option to keep color ambient mode does not work.  Could also use an option for how long to keep in Active mode before switching to ambient.  Would totally 5-star this face if we had these!   (LG Urbane, Samsung Galaxy 6, Marshmallow)",
        "Great app I don't pay for watch faces and this is the best free one I have come across. You can change all of the colors which a lot of free versions won't allow. And I love that you get an indicator on the face showing you how many new texts you have.",
        "Great looking watch face! A little bit draining on the battery life, but still manageable.   One key thing that is bugging me though is, what is the correct format to change the \"Date format text\"? I've tried mm/dd/yyyy, to manually inputting the date, nothing seems to work properly. Please tell me!!",
        "my favourite face looks great on a zenwatch 2,  i see some complain about certain omitted widgets but I think it may spoil it. With regard to the animation being unable to disable,  the remedy for this is in the watch functions and settings,  timeouts etc. this is a polished high quality face,  looked great square or round"

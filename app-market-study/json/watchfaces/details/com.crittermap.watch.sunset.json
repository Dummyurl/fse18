        "Might work well on a smartwatch but I have found it stops/lags behind several hours until I tap on it to show the accurate set screen and then it updates the widget. 12 hour time mode won't display morning \"golden hour\"  Disappointing as it was just what I wanted for my photography and WAS glad to pay for it.  All other apps and widgets work flawlessly on my phone.  I was hoping for a large widget of 3x3 or 4x4 as displayed in the picture not just a tiny 2x2.",
        "A decent alternative to staticfree's widget A nice, competent alternative to staticfree's 24h clock widget and watch face, with even more information available like a digital clock and moon phase and transit. What I'd like to see is a less dense layout - no gradient or hour arrows in normal mode, and no twilight indicators in ambient mode - but it's very useful as it currently is.",
        "Damn! I so wanted to give this app and widget with its glorious graphics 5 stars, but like many other widgets, it frequently freezes. A simple click on the widget refreshes it instantly, but damn... you pay for a premium app and they can't get this right?",
        "Very nice app, just the colours of twilight and night (is not uniform) are a bit inaccurate and also, it's not showing the real actual time the hour pointer is 10-20 mins behind. Only the day colour is displayed correctly. Maybe it would be better if you include also a more accurate astronomical design for astronomers and keep this fancy one for standard users.",
        "Nice, but... At p.m. in 12 hour mode can't draw the next dawn after midnight, look as daytime. And I want minute (or second) hand for clock if possible.",

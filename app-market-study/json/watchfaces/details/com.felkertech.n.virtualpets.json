    "description": "Cybercritters is a digital pet video game built for Android platform, with a focus on Android Wear. The goal of this game is to hatch a baby critter and raise it properly by feeding, cleaning, and playing with it over a course of several weeks. As you take care of it, your critter will grow from a baby, to a child, all the way to an adult. The better you take care of it, the finer an adult it will become. An adult critter will be able to lay eggs that you can collect, hatch, and raise yourself. The digital pet genre has already been incredibly successful; millions of people already playing these games on a variety of form factors. Android Wear is the next ideal candidate for this genre because increased mobility allows you to quickly take care of your pet all day through notifications. With the \"My Pet\" watchface, you can keep track of your pet all the time on your wrist!For users who do not have an Android Wear device, the game is fully supported on Android phones and tablets. Android TV support will be coming in the next few weeks. This game is free to download, with in-app purchases to unlock certain types of pets. Everything will be kept in sync using Google Play Games' cloud saves.Follow us on social media!https://www.facebook.com/cybercrittershttps://plus.google.com/115414846221253701950https://twitter.com/cybercritters",

        "Im liking it. Needs slight improvements When I downloaded it I expected Google fit on wear should be enough to get the egg to hatch,but apparently you need it on your phone to hatch and all that other cool stuff. Can you make it so it can track the steps from your watch? Other than that little issue so far I'm liking it.",
        "It installed on my smartwatch and I can't get rid of this trash even when I removed app from phone. I will need to reset my watch and curse developer!",

        "Pretty good but the game needs some work",
        "Won't read my steps It's a good idea, I like the idea of it being usable on my smart watch as well, but the step counter does not work.",

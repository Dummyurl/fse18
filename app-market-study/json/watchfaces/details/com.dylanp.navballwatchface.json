        "Upside down? Navball appears upside down on my watch. Is this a \"Down Under\" joke on us Australians? I so want this to be cool, but that's really quite annoying. Also, the shift to the cut-down Ambient time is annoying if you're looking at it when it changes.",
        "Beautiful It isn't a good shape for my square watch so I won't use it which is a shame since it looks good otherwise.  On a square face it gets too small.  Great work though!",
        "I want to use this so badly... But it isn't showing up in my watch settings. Just got the watch today, in part to use this face, and it isn't working.  Sad face",
        "Not working Was so excited to try this watch face since I work at sea but unfortunately does not work on LG urbane urbane 2nd edition LTE",

        "Phlash you're Killing em! Just went back to Android Wear from Samsung, and I was like what new fresh watches can I find? It's been about a year the game should've advanced in that time. Lo and behold Tha Phlash is still killing em with the freshest, most realistic, and well designed faces. From the tiny details to function he's killing em all! Just coped that Super too from ur site that's what's up! Will definitely buy more. Have like 6 of his already. Lol.",
        "Hands Down. This is hands down the best looking watch face available for the Moto 360.  Unbelievable style, fantastic customization options (the shortcuts on the metronome were an especially nice touch)... just a winner all around. How is this guy not at the top of the android wear suggested apps?",
        "Great design Love this. One question- twilight mode, does this change automatically? I have America and come night time the face colours change, so is this supposed to happen with Steampunk as it currently doesn't on my Huawei watch? Thanks",
        "OK Google doesn't work I switched watch faces to test and voice control worked fine. And my color settings never stick. It randomly switches back to the default yellow. Huawei smartwatch.",
        "Beauty but at a small cost I Love I mean LOVE this face. It looks amazing on my Huawei watch. The overall look and the ability to customize the face are spectacular. I had a small issue with battery life, but Phlash hooked me up with a super simple fix. 5 stars just doesn't seem to be enough stars.",
        "Another work of art. It was hard to pick a favorite from your incredible work until now. Love all of your watch faces but this one really got me. Keep it up and I'll keep getting them."

Decades of scientific research and groundbreaking physical models now allow your phone's internal light sensor to accurately measure your ultraviolet exposure from the sun!*NOTE: Most phones have a limited internal light sensor that can't detect bright light. This is not a bug in the app, but a limitation of the phone hardware.

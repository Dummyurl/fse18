        "Very nice option for Moto 260 Sport. Love the ticks (aka indices) options, I use 4. Would like to see day and date but know this is available on the 2.0 version if Motorola ever gets their act together and release AW2 on the Sport.",
        "Nice, clean n minimal Only slight grumble is for the configuration to be done from the wear app, only to preview what the face will look like",
        "Fantastic watch face! One of the best watchface for Android Wear! And the dev is very dedicated! Little request: can you make an option to NOT display cards info on ambient mode?",
        "Beautiful Watch Face!! Looks really nice! I often find myself coming back to this face. It also offers amazing customisation, you can change the way everything looks, the colour ect. Very nice job, love it, one of my favourite watch faces 10/10 :D",
        "Good looking watch! I enjoy the nice design of this watch. It's easily customisable and works great!",
        "Very nice Looking forward to seeing the updates and widgets. The \"Fruit\" company do indeed make some nice watch faces, so additional functional elements would be great"

        "Please try to place the settings inside android wear app Very good watchface, it is just a little annoying having in the app drawer the icon just for some minor settings. Keep up the good work! :)",
        "Ok Please try to get the settings on the wear app. Also I never did see the phase change",
        "Watch face list too cluttered There's no need to add a different watch face in the Android Wear app for every different configuration, it clutters the list.",
        "Bleh! I can't pick the blue color moon you show. So I hate this app. I also don't see any other option other then 12hr button.",
        "Love it but wish it had more options than just a 24h vs 12h clock",
        "The app isn't working anymore it tells time but only in military. I had this face for 2 weeks now and it was running in 12 hour time periods. Please fix"

        "Stylish metal watch face Downloaded watch face because of the metallic blue color on my Huawei watch and it looks great! The ambience mode could be a little better (didn't show the info circles) but does show the date which was a must for me. I like that you can customize the face but is limited to things like the length of the tick marks.",
        "Love it I had the LG Urbane and my favorite face was the stock Chronus face. I just got the Huawei Watch and was going to miss the LG face.  This one is not identical but it's very similar in color and style and Im happy with it",
        "I really like the look of the watch face, but a full color ambient mode would make it perfect. It looks too good to be hidden by a black and white ambient mode! Also, an option to increase the screen on time before ambient turns on would be appreciated.",
        "Best purchase for custom watch face.  The sweeping seconds hand is perfect and the dark blue starburst dial blends in beautifully with my ZenWatch 2's midnight blue bezel!  Please add a Second Time Zone dial!",
        "Watch face look nice, but app did not made any shortcut to configuration so I needed to create my own to configuration activity. It is buggy I guess",
        "Won't show Never showed in watch faces"

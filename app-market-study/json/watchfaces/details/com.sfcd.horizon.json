        "Love the ambient-to-active animation! Only gripe is that the colon is always in the middle of the screen, so in 12h mode when it's before 10:00, the whole time looks slightly off to the right. Not sure if this is intended or not.",
        "Great start. But as a typical Android user, I'd like to request some customisation options, such as text size, date, and the duration of the ambient -> awake animation.",
        "Blinks There are some blinks, when I turn on screen light",
        "I don't know what I think, I downloaded it and can't find where it is located on my phone",

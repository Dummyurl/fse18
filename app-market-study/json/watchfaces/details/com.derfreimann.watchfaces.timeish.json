        "This has been my watchface for over 2 months now, and will continue to be. The only thing that annoys me, though, is that it reads \"past eight\" even if it is 8:15. The dev can try and implement \"quarter past eight\" for 8:11 through 8:20, and \"quarter to nine\" for \"8:41 to 8:50\". Makes more sense than \"past eight\", and gives slightly more information, whilst keeping everything else simple.",
        "Love it.  I initially installed this just for a lark, but have ended up using it as my primary watch face: turns out that in the majority of cases the time it presents is just about as accurate as I need, and for the remainder I can always squint at the precise time at the top of the screen.",
        "This is good. Great idea! Just one issue, in my Sony sw3 the do not disturb/charging icon overlaps a little bit the hour, could be awesome if you include language selection, like Spanish hehe.",
        "Love it My favourite watchface of all time. It can be a little too vague sometimes saying it's half past all the way up to quarter to.",
        "Installed and disappeared. No where to be found on my phone or watch.",
        "I really want this.  It's downloaded and installed.  But doesn't appear in my phone or on my watch.  Using a gear 2. Help!!!"

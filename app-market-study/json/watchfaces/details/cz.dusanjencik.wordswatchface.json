        "Very nice watch face Would love to see a little more customization. Would prefer the letters randomize once per wake up, not constantly. Other than that, it's perfect.",
        "Usually, describing the time after \"half past\" the hour is rounded up to the next hour. Please update so that \"ten past half past ten\" is instead stated as \"twenty minutes to 11\".",
        "\"It is ten past half past eleven.\"??? Who says that?? I LOVE this app beside this. Try \"It is twenty to eleven\", or something a little more normal.",
        "Awesome."

        "My reason for owning a smart watch. Thank you!",
        "Can you please add 12 hour options as well?",
        "I love how customisable the watchface is. Was a bit annoyed at first that I had to also get Watchmaker Premium to use it, but it was definitely worth it. I enjoy constantly changing its functions and adapting it to what I need (and Watchmaker really allows me to do that, but it took some getting used to). My only criticism is that on my watch the more advanced of the watchfaces included does not really work that well (lags constantly and drains my battery), but that is obviously due to my hardware limitations. Still, it would be nice to have a lighter version of that watchface as well.",
        "Mate love this watch face been using it for over a year now. Just changed from a Sony Smartwatch 3 to a new Asus Zenwatch 2. Noticed the giro or direction sensor doesn't work on the zenwatch. Is this a flaw with the watch or do I need to change a setting?"

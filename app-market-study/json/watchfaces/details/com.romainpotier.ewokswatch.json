        "Similar to another review below, I tried installing the application but could not find a way to access the application anywhere on my phone. Clicking on the \"application successfully installed\" notification brings me back to the application's Google Play Store page. This seems to be an issue with either download/install or compatibility​ with my phone.",
        "This is an outstanding watch face! What can I say? Battery life is good, love the material design and animations, good, clean design, has the date and it's ewoks! 5 stars! Keep up the great work devs!",
        "This watch face suits my TAG connected band.. which is orange.. love it... but the only thing that bothers me is the autonomy.. burn mode.. what is that.. overall great job",
        "Awesome watch face. Has no extra info except the time and date. Always on versions of the ewoks are even cooler (just the outlines). Ewoks change from time to time after waking up the watch. Very easy to read the time.",
        "This watch face is great for 3 reasons-material design, cute, great ambient mode. I just wish there was a battery meter.",
        "This watch face is really cute BUT please add the option to make the time format 12h and option to show the battery percentage. Nothing more :)"

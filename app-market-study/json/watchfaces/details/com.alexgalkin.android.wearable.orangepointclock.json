        "My favourite watch face... but ... I also keep getting \"unfortunately. ...has stopped\" even while writing this review!  I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still the same. I have a galaxy note 4. Please fix.",
        "Great face but... Great layout with all the info I need at a glance - clean and sharp. I am using the green/red color scheme. The ambient screen dims and the only thing to disappear of the sweep second hand. Battery life does not appear to be affected but have not had app long. I will update if any significant findings. The problem I have with the analog watch faces, in general, is the hands cover the info at certain times. Suggest make mini distinctive hour and minute hands at the outer edge so as not to cover any info.Thx!",

        "Not of much use on android. Have yet to here back from support and wishing I had not paid for premium. Was outstanding on WP. Changed to Droid 12/17 and conditions have allowed little use. Paid annual premium thinking it was for Active Fitness. Now question why it didn't cover both apps. Don't both give same info? Been using Winter for several years and have loved it, sharing with many friends. WP app seemed much easier to navigate. Some toggles do nothing on droid. Haven't figured out how to track or locate friends among other glitches. Previous screen name D Scott Prall. What ever, all the same email. Thanks",
        "Great fixes in the last version. Love starting new season with new ski apps",
        "Latest fixes. Very good interface, GPS tracker, maps, resorts, everything you need on the mountain. Plus it works without any connection!",
        "Thanks for the latest update. Fixed everything, great skiing app.",
        "Very comprehensive",
        "Every skier's dream Love the app."

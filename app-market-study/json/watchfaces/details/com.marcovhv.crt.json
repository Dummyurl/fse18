        "Almost perfect This is a great idea. One of my favorites. Kind of a bit horror movie esque. I do wish the ambient mode were a bit more visible though. As is its hard to read until I wake it up.",
        "I love the look - very Alien. 24h mode is needed however. Also it would be great to have an option to display date and hide the battery indicator. I'd like to see more designs by you.",
        "Great U know what? I love this and it will last for ages on my lg g watch. Only thing is....I need the date.... Please",
        "Great effect Looks like a classic VHS viewfinder playback at low contrast and saturation.",
        "Doesn't work Not working with Huawei Watch; app doesn't sync to watch",
        "Great Love it but would really like a 24 hour mode option."

        "Pleasantly Surprised! Find these free watch faces quite often and they look grainy and unrealistic. This doesn't. Looks equally good in ambient mode too. Really nice, classy watch face. Thankyou!",
        "Classic look, but stuck with only Silver color scheme Looks great on my Moto 360 2nd gen, but unable to set the golden color scheme. Do let me one if it is supported on my smartwatch, if yes, how to switch.",
        "It also has a silver option!  (not just yellow) Classy watch face.... and impressive ambient face.  Good watch face... especially for free..",
        "My favorite watch face and I rock it most of the time. However, I wish the developers would make an AMOLED friendly version with a pure black background!",
        "Really nice looking watch face. A minor detail is that the 15 tick goes in to the date view. 5 stars when that is fixed :-)",
        "It will be perfect if the ambient mode is not black and white Pls make an option for user to keep the golden color in the ambient mode. The golden color is an amazing thing while the black and white color is terrible."

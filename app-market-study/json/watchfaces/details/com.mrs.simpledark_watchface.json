        "Oct 2017 Review.  Perfect for what I want. very customizable.  Can have many options for ambient display..  colors and complications.  Only wish i could display more info with digital clock..  but best overall option by far! ** request ** ability to add custom color chooser ?",
        "This is a really good watch face. I just have one question about burn in protection for OLED watches. I am not sure if I can see the watch face shifting around by a couple of pixels or not. Can you help?",
        "Excellent face. Very clean design, with a good range of options and low levels of battery consumption.",
        "Excellent product. Very user friendly. Options all useful. Thanks!",
        "Best watch face have ever used. Have been using watch faces for last 2 years, at last found a watch face which is simple, light and powerful. Thus gives more battery life with all useful features and compilations.  Like the following features the most: 1) calendar in the custom compilation. 2) 13-24 marker  3) digital clock, with actual digital font and color  Great job !",
        "Really like the simplicity of watchface. I would like a choice to show notifications at the bottom along with the number of notifications that haven't been cleared."

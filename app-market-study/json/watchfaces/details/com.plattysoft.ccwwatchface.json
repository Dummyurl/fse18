    "description": "Counter clock wise (CCW) watches move the hands in the opposite direction.They are also known as counterclockwise, anticlockwise, reverse and backwards watches.Why? Because I like logic and because that definition of clockwise motion is \"is one that proceeds in the same direction as a clock's hands\" (Wikipedia). That implies that a counterclockwise watch is a logical contradiction on itself.This watchface is Free Software and the code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/plattysoft/CCWWatchface",

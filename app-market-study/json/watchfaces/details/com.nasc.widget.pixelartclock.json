        "First, let me say the clock is beautiful and the customization is amazing! The only issue I'm having is that it doesn't actually work as a clock. It doesn't update with the time. Sometimes it updates a couple minutes late, and sometimes it keeps up for about a half-hour, but eventually stops updating completely unless I go in the app. A restart fixes it temporarily, but it always stops working. Fix it and I'll definitely buy the in-app purchase.",
        "Couple of things Works well, looks great but could do with the option to customise the size, amount of area it covers. It's too small for me, on my tablet. Also someone mentioned in the comments about it being available on lock screen, that would be really cool. Also also, last number on time has gone tiny for some reason?",
        "LG G Watch Issue The time doesn't update on my LG G Watch. In using a Nexus 6 running the latest lollipop build and the latest android wear updates for app and phone. Issue arose on new-years eve when the latest update came through. Will make a 5 when working again as I love this app.",
        "Character size This is an amazing and awesome app but when chose the star wars character one thing really bothered me, their size. It made it difficult to read the time quite a bit. But if you could make the characters smaller or move them a little or even give a size option it would help a lot.",
        "Looks great but not perfect for round watches Love the looks and customization options, but in the Moto 360 there's no way to reposition the date widget to the top - instead it's hidden by the watches' black bar at the bottom",
        "Love it but the time is frozen I love the look of this on my LG G watch and I adore the customization options but it doesn't display the correct time which makes it not very useful for a watch. A minor fault I find annoying is I can't make it display the date as dd/mm/yyyy; checking & unchecking the mm/dd/your box has no effect. A real shame as it deserves 5 stars if not for these issues."

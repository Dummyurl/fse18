        "This should easily be a 5 star face as it looks AMAZING but unfortunately it lacks the basic functionality of a 12 hour mode. When I first tried this app in the morning I was convinced this was my favorite face but into the afternoon I saw the 24 hour time and was disappointed. It has a wonderful amount of color customizations though but ultimately fails in the most basic area of simply displaying the time. I would think the aspect of displaying the time would be the first area of customization."

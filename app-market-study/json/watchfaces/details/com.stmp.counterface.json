        "This is an excellent watch face (especially in ambient / dim mode).  On my Huawei smart watch it did everything as advertised.  (I currently have the countdown clock set to vacation start date!).  Only challenge I had was with weather updating.  However, I emailed the designer and he got back to me within a few hours with suggests. Now it works 100%.  Great watchface and great designer!",
        "Nicely done! Great looking watch face with good options. It's definitely one of the best looking watch faces out there, however the countdown timer is a bit useless to me & I wish there were more options for what the center button does. It'd also be nice to be able to change the dim mode's colours. As some others have mentioned, I wish I could change the dimming time as well. Great watch face all around.  (My watch is a Nixon Mission SmartWatch).",
        "Wow, just wow! First : I can't believe anyone could rate this less than 4 stars!!  Amazing product, great options and customizable.  Second : Thank you for keeping it simple.  I'm no tech genius and I pretty much have this set up the way I like it.  If only there was some sort of super shortcut to a stop watch function I'd be in heaven!!",
        "Generally nice, bit worried about ring Good and original idea for a watchface, quite well executed - I like the style. Only problem is that the central ring is 1) I find visually unappealing (obv subjective!) but also 2) bit worried about using it on an AMOLED screen 'cos burn in. If there was an option to replace the ring with a 1-2 pixel colored circle (keep glow etc) then it would be a great everyday watch face and would be well worth a $ or so. Or if the ring had a separate dim brightness option I suppose so I could  set it down to like 10%",
        "Best watch face yet I often grew frustrated after downloading a watch face app, only to find it extremely simplistic unless I paid for the premium. This app is customizable in the free mode as if it were premium."

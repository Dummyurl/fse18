        "Good but needs some tweaks I love the concept the animation looks a lot like my mechanical watch. It could use some work in the colors and finishing the animation/movements though. The numbers for seconds were pretty hard to read on my moto360 and the movement animation resets at a certain point and ends up jumping around causing it to look unfinished. Could be 5 stars for sure with some more work.",
        "Nothing like how it looks in store Sadly as others have said this watch face is not a lot of use as it does not sit centrally plus it shows square with grey border on three sides.",
        "Doesn't work I have the LG Urbane 2 LTE and this thing doesn't center, the arms/hands of the clock are not centered heck they are not ever on the clock...",
        "I like the animations and the concept a lot, but it doesn't fill up the screen of my Moto 360 2nd Gen. watch. If you can fix this, then this would get 5 stars from me.",
        "Unimpressive It's square, not round. Also very hard to read. Nice idea; poor execution.",
        "Had hope Bad colors, tough to read, wish it had any adjustments."

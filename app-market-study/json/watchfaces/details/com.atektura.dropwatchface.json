        "A pretty solid face Drop has beautiful, smooth animations and bright colors that I really appreciate.  I would like to be able to change the battery percentage to the date (and adding support for the Wear 2.0 complications API would be even better).  It would also be cool if you could make your own ripples on the face by tapping it.",

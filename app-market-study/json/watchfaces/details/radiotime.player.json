        "After the new update i thought it was my phone or my Bluetooth speaker that made the app pause after 9, 10 minutes. I tried it with 2 phones and 2 Bluetooth speakers and it wasn't either one. I think thetes a glitch on the new tune in update thats makes it pause for no reason. Please fix i love the app",
        "Radio from your whole town and your home world! I had the premium for a while but removing the audio books is a big mistake. Bring those books back and it be happy to pay a monthly rate. Not worth it just for live sports.",
        "I like radio. Tunein makes it easy to find online stations. Was reluctant to pay ten bucks to remove ads and get the ability to record but am glad I did. The record feature is handy. When I hear something I want to save, just rewind and press record...cool! Good app.",
        "Wow you guys have fallen. Bought pro a few years ago. Watched you destroy the UI, remove app features and also f-over your Pro payers like me. Now I open the app to a massive subscription request where you want me to pay for a yearly premium subscription for a hilarious €115 annually? There's a tiny little X at the top to close it. God help anyone who falls for it. You've also changed the Logo AGAIN to something even more ugly. Audio books are gone and now you inject ads before my stream despite me paying for this. Disgraceful. The UI looks like trash. I'll be deleting my account and telling everyone to stay away. Rot in hell.",
        "Nice to be able to listen to programs of interest. However when I record a show to listen later, there are many gaps in the program and doesn't seem to record the complete show.",
        "New design is an improvement but issues raised six months ago still exist. Rather fed up with raising them and nothing happens."

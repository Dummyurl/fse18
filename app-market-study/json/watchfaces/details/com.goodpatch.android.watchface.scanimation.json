        "Cool watchface! Please try to remove the icon from the app drawer. A great looking and functional watchface. It is just a little bit annoying to have the icon in the app drawer just for some minor settings, try to place them inside the android wear app. Thanks! Keep up the good work!",
        "It's OK Definitely needs some options like how long it stays at full brightness. Right now it's now on long enough to get from one side of the screen to the other. Also date and time options."

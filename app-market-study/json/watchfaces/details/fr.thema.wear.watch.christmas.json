        "Brilliant. Looks great, lots of customisation options, loads of fun for the time of year. Would love to be able to see date, watch battery and phone battery simultaneously - that would make it perfect.",
        "I love funky sweaters and I love this watch face. Nice job!",
        "Good face",
        "Get in the Christmas spirit! This is a cool watch face. Pick your sweater style and colors. Works great on my square watch (ZenWatch 2). Only issue is I would rather have a countdown to Christmas rather than the battery percentage. Still really cool.",
        "Well, not bad. It's not bad, but the battery % is never right. Not a deal breaker, but very annoying sometimes. I wish I could just turn it off.",
        "Excellent You can customise the sweater to make a really tiny ugly Christmas jumper , best 73p I've ever spent"

The publisher responds to all comments with the same canned response that has nothing to do with the review. And now I am getting phone pop up notifications to buy more faces from them. Not impressed by this AT ALL.",
        "Needs options Very cool but I'd like to see some customization options for the notifications on the left depending on what msg service you use and maybe email",

        "I've tried 101 faces since I got my moto 360. Now I think Rider from weareal is the one I have been looking for.. Well done guys! Whoops, now I have a problem. After one day, the app won't recognise my location (Rønne, Denmark), always OK with other apps. Can I use another weather app here?",
        "Very nice watchfaces for Huawei smartwatch. Very classic. High quality. Would like to be able to control the ambient brightness independent of the active mode. I wanted to purchase the airpower watchfaces but the lack of color customization was a deal breaker for me. Please bring more classic watchfaces. Thank you",

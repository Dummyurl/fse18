        "Beautiful looking face! Would like to see further options for customization of the dials and colors.",
        "Please give us the option for full colored ambient mode.",
        "High quality! It looks great and is high resolution!",
        "Very Nice A really nice watch face. My one issue is that in ambient mode it cab be a little hard to read the hands/dials when they overlap, but I'm unsure how you'd fix that.",
        "Beautiful watch face by a great dev, just wish it was on watchmaker so I could tweak it exactly to my liking... But then again I'm annoyingly OCD about little details",
        "Really cool watchface. I was looking for something new for my watch and here it is. This makes my watch look very real (non-smartwatch) and authentic. I think I will be using this for a while."

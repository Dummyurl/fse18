        "Used to really love this watch face. But it looks like it no longer supports Android Wear versions below 2 so I can't use it anymore.",
        "I don't know if it's a regional thing, or not, but where I live, we wouldn't say \"twenty-five past five.\" We'd say, \"five twenty-five.\" It would be nice to have an option to word it that way.",
        "It does not show up on my android watch, Moto 2nd gen. I checked both watch apps and Android wear app on phone. Only shows up on the phone.",
        "Doesn't show up in Android Wear",
        "Another watch face purchased, another one that won't show up on my watch or in the Android wear app.",
        "Very crisp indeed The default faces already look really nice, but a tad more customization would make this app reach five stars. My wishlist (in ascending order): hybrid fuzziness, i.e. text in five minute intervals with four small dots for accuracy by the minute like in Qlocktwo; more fonts; a color slider for each element of the face; a donation button."

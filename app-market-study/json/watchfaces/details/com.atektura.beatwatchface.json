        "Needs alot more info Only purchased this because I'm a live sound engineer and this is the only audio related face i can get on my watch. This face needs more detailed meters and information for a paid watch face. Should include at least a Battery level, another meter to make minutes more accurate, maybe a few faders or eq knobs to show dates/temp. Maybe a gain control or something off a channel on a mixer. This 3 meter should be free for the lack of functionality and features. Needs much improvement.",
        "It's OK, Not good for the actual time as mins are in mutiples of five. But is kinda works",
        "Not bad As a professional audio engineer, I am looking forward to those updates to come out to make this face worth my money."

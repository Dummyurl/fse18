        "Devs - Get your act together! Ambient mode should be a dimmer version of normal. Unfortunately it's a mono-colour version. Also as many others have said to no avail - the battery level needs to fit in the circle. Come on devs - get your act together!!",
        "Nice but I'm thinking this Dev is not open to suggestions. Plus misleading pictures. The pics are misleading. It shows the %fitting in the circle. (Screen shot it for your records) ESPECIALLY the 3rd pic. It should all be reduced to fit inside the circle. But now that I look at the reviews and some of the dates to this very complaint in 2014, obviously these request for corrections will go ignored. They need to refund if they have no plans to fix it. Guess I won't be buying anymore unfortunately :-/",

        "You are awesome. Dev will actually reply to emails and in detail. Super awesome to see such dedication to your own product, it's not something I see much anymore. Updated from 4 to 5 stars without hesitation. Would still love to see a battery indicator ;P",
        "It's a great watch face. Does what it says and more. Love the minimalistic look of it and love all the options. Wish it had a few more things on the face (maybe weather...) but otherwise works great. Also if your wondering if this works with square watches it does. ðŸ˜‰  Sony SmartWatch 3",
        "Love it! Its my favorite watch face, but it does have one short coming. On my ZenWatch 2, Ambient Mode doesn't work with it! It'll go into ambient mode then just away away after a few seconds It's something I can live without and I still use it daily, but its still a little problem.",
        "I've run into a problem that I can't seem to figure out. I can get the watch face onto my Android Wear device, but I can't customize the face at all. It's beautiful as is, but I can't figure out hot to customize it from my Galaxy S6. :/",
        "App never loaded on Android Wear. Disconnected and connected from the phone and nothing. I really wanted to use it. Android 7.1-Moto 360 1st G.",
        "Simply one of the best watch faces out there. Really customizable and I love that there isn't an extra app that goes with it (I want my app drawer as uncluttered as possible), just the menu available via the android Wear app. Also, no ads! Great job!"

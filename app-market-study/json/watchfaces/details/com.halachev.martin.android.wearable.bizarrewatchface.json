        "I do like this watch but there are 2 functions I'd love added to it if you can. 1. Extend the time to something like 20 seconds before it goes into ambient mode. 2. To have the ability to press on the date and it show your agenda for the day. If you could do that for me that last star would be lit up like a Christmas tree :))",

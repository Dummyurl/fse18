        "It makes a sound every time it updates. I've gone into settings and shut every sound off. How do I make it stop??  Ability to see both hourly & weekly forecasts is nice, but I wanted that capability for the widgets, not in the app. (You have to select hourly OR weekly forecast in the widget settings menu). Provides a temperature notification icon permanently at the top of screen (very convenient at a quick glance). I love the widget background/transparency options.",
        "Have been looking for widget with weather and date/time that doesn't take up so much of the screen. This seems to do the best. Wish widget were 4x1 and more tweekable but, good enough. Fir example, shrink the time a bit. I like that it shows as much info as it does; I'd be willing to loose some of it for a smaller widget. Also like that the widget touch area is sensitive such that tap on clock area brings up clock and two on weather area bring up whether.",
        "One of the best weather apps available. Multable options other similar apps don't offer make it the best. Displays are well done and I especially like the transparency option for my home page. Only complaint would be GPS location. Finds the neighborhood but not the correct address. Hard to understand why since other apps have no problem at all. Must be the polar shift üòä",
        "It is a very nice app. The only thing I were better is the clock. It does not allow for 24 hour, military time. That's regardless of what your phone setting is. It also has a leading zero which is even sillier if you're not going to have a 24-hour.  That is even if you use a larger Widgets or on the app itself. I wish the five by 1 widget was a little bit better laid out in terms of being able to seize a date and time.",
        "It was great. Good looking. Then, about a year in, it stopped keeping itself updated. The time is almost always off from my phone's time. I'm hoping there's a fix for this.  Revision: after uninstalling and dealing with accuweather's very unappealing (albeit, accurate).... I decided I'd give this bad-boy another go. Not a problem since. It's great and my screen looks a lot better than my month without it.",
        "Really like your app! The large clock text makes it SO easy to read the time. Just wish you could make the other text information on the widget customizable. Can just make most of it out with difficulty. The rest is so tiny I can't see it. It's a very nice app. Thanks!"

        "A novel watch face, though lacking display elements like seconds and date. Those aren't necessarily important, so my only real gripe is how small it is on a round watch (or, perhaps, a higher-resolution one like my Huawei Watch.",
        "Amazing simplistic design, by far my favourite. Would like the option to change to 12hr, without changing phone settings.",
        "Awesome The beauty of this watch face is it's simplicity. It is my favorite so far.",
        "More! This is how smartwatch faces should be."

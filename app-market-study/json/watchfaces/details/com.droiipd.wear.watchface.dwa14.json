        "Beware this app will bombard you with ads even though you pay for their product! They also trick you into wasting your return window! Pay $2 for a watch face only to realize that it's app is bombarding my phone with ads. And they cleverly enough tell you to wait up to 15 minutes for the watch face to appear on your watch which is what Google Play Store return window is for apps. After about 10 minutes the watch face still did not appear after disconnecting and reconnecting my watch multiple times and restarting my phone so I've decided to not take a chance and refund the app. I just had to come here and warn everyone",
        "No option to change the time it takes to go into ambient mode",
        "Very beautiful indeed!!! Thank you so much!!!",
        "A decent face for your androidwear There has been shebangs with this developer and their previous updates. They listened and fixed what needed a fix. Now, this is one decent face for your watch should you need a beautiful look.",
        "Ambient mode is far too bright. I love this face but the ambient mode drains my battery very fast. On my Huawei watch I see a day of life rather than 2 and a half.",
        "Love it Really good looking watch face. Elegant, and work beautifully!"

        "It's ok. Really nothing amazing here. The watchface looks good but in the description it is implied there is a bunch of customization but really all you can do is change the background. There is no date option. I also find it hard to believe that this watchface is \"optimized\" to magically give you better battery life. Also seems there hasn't been an update in over a month which makes me a little nervous these basic features will not come.",
        "Tricky to setup , for some reason it wasn't working, now it is",
        "I was looking  forward to it but it won't woke on my fossil av tryed unstalling  and installing plus resync still not working please help",
        "Beautiful Crisp and clear...only wish I could be able to have date displayed and maybe change fonts",
        "Its not coming up on my moto 360",

        "This is a decent app. Has a lot of choices for watch faces all of witch are editable. The only problems I have had has been with updates with android wear and this app updating causing the watch to stop working with both apps.  The developer is good enough to help as much as he can although sometimes you can get lost in the instructions.",
        "I picked this face when I got my watch because it was, well, minimal and elegant. It showed what I needed (including some things I hadn't thought of needing, like battery levels), clearly and simply. The developer keeps adding even better functions - music control and now Tasker integration, among the highlights! Still simple and functional, and getting better all the time.",
        "Really neat watch app. It has presets, you can make changes to those, or you can make your own. It takes some patience to get used to but it is neat.",
        "So many choices for preset faces, so many customizable options, and if your creative enough with a little time you can make your own. This app is \"a one stop\" for watch faces.",
        "The app is nice please add support for misfit vapor or pls suggest which option to select for Vapor.",
        "The best watch faces I've seen so far.  If you can't find a face then you're not looking."

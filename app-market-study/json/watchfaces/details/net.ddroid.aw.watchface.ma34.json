        "Hands and features are off center.  Contacted them,  but no response.   Try one of the other faces.",
        "Not displayed properly on moto 360 Like the watch face however the minute and hour hands are off center making the face look strange and unusable. Do not download.",
        "Not worth purchasing yet Watch face is alright but the hour/minute hands are not centered.  Can't use it like that.",
        "Ok Error downloading, finally made it. Would like a different set of hands. Hands need to be calibrated as 24 hour dial doesn't line up, others a 'little' off as well and appear not to move until midnight. A nice overall look that needs to be polished.",
        "Great!! Very nice watch face but could you please give an option to not use the black and white watch face. Its annoying when it shows up and then quickly switches to the main watch face. Otherwise I love it so much.",
        "Sucks Extreme lag and looks very low res. Moto 360."

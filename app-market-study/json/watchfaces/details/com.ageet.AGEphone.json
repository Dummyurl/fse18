        "Mostly harmless Simple to configure for my asterisk/freepbx system. Good audio quality on LAN.   Can't find any way to change the inbound ringtone... the standard tone is too quiet. Also, settings are unavailable when it is \"Trying\" to connect, which means a small error in config leads to having to completely delete the app data in the app manager.  Would like the option to change the ringtone, and to turn it off completely. Then it would get a 5 star from me.",

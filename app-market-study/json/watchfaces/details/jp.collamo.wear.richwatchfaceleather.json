        "Finally a good ana/digi watch face for square smartwatches! Please make the black version really \"black\"(I think it makes it easier to read in direct sunlight). Other than this, it's beautiful and works, no background services to use phone's memory, etc. Thank you!",
        "dont work moto 360",
        "Square Finally a beautiful display for square watch faces.",
        "Alright Looks decent enough. Somewhat annoying that it takes up two slots in the face selector menu, but depending on how often you change watch face, that might be OK. What bugged me the most was that the round faces seem actually flatten out at the bottom, so now my LG G Watch R has the same bezel at the bottom that the Moto 360 has.",
        "Looking good on LG G watch I'm using the basic black square watch face and I gotta say, it looks pretty nice. My favorite aspect is that it displays both analog and digital clocks one one face, along with the date (and seconds when tapped).",
        "No customization options Good looking watch faces, but I think there should be an ability to customize the faces when it comes to weather, battery levels, digital clock appearance, etc."

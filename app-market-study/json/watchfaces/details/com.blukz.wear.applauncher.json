        "Provide shortcuts to apps without the trouble to swipe through a list to find them. Best setup for me is grid launcher with blacklisted apps ending in showing only six app that I use the most.",
        "Battery drain on moto 360 I preferred it to wear launcher, since it is more responsive, but it drained the battery of my moto 360 like crazy.",
        "A Great little launcher! Especially after making the switch from Apple. Just wondering if there is a way to arrange the apps in the iWatch theme.",
        "Moto 360 I can't get it to work on my moto 360. Please fix this.",
        "Sucks!!! This Wear launcher is terrible. It gives you 4 launchers to choose from, and one doesnt even work!",
        "Easy to use. Just swipe to see apps instead of going through menus and searching for each program you want to use."

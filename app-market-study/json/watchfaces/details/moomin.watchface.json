        "Needs options and spoilt by brandmark It would get five stars if the 'Moomin' words wouldn't block some of the important parts of the images (it completely blocks Moomin Papa on one of them). It would also be nice to be able to pick a less 'wacky' typeface and to turn off the seconds circle.",
        "Cute but stuck on Military 24-hour Time! What's up with ask these new watch faces that sunny give you the option of displaying 12-hour mode? I don't want to get stuck doing math when I want to quickly know the time! No thanks! Uninstalled.",
        "Lol ok cute for old times sake Like to change my watch face every few days and this is really making me smile.  Thanks designers.",
        "12 hour time option. Will revise review when watch face has a 12 hour option.",
        "really unique and lovely"

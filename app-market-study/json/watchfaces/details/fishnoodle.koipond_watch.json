        "Had to uninstall Although i liked this on my Huawei,and Zenwatch 2 smartwatches  and it looked just as good as the phone and tablet app. I had to uninstall it because  the background customization and watch face options havent worked in the settings, fix this and definitely will reinstall",
        "Really nice...... Any chance on being able to change the colour of the clocks and perhaps an option for the length of time the screen stays on in any future updates ? Also...... Great whites would look pretty cool ðŸ˜‚",
        "Excellent good job Sencilla pero muy funcional gracias por esta aplicacion",
        "Love it It's been a great watch face and worked well until I got a new phone and had to reset watch. Now it has a black gap on the top like on the bottom of my 360.  Any ideas?",
        "It's ok... It's nice like the version for phones and tablets... But it keeps freezing up my Moto 360.... Always gives me an application not responding... But it's nice...",
        "Koi watch face It's a good face but I found its very heavy on the battery on my sony smart watch 3 a shame or it would be 5 stars"

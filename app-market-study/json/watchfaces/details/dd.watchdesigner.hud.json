        "Good, when it works... Visually stunning, and stylish, this watch face is great to look at, and provides easy to read info. Unfortunately, that's about where it ends... This face provides zero interactivity, and crashes every couple hours with alarming regularity. Stay away, except to show off what your watch can do."

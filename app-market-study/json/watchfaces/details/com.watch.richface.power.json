        "It looks great. I paid the money for Prime, but the Fit sync never syncs and the companion app crashes. I emailed tech support, but haven't heard back yet. I'll update the review if the developer responds and resolves it. Update: the developer responded and said they couldn't fix it and refunded my money. It's a shame because it's a really nice looking watch face.",
        "I payed for the app on my S4 it uses to crash slot and not sync... I thought that as the phone was old and had plenty on it is ok. I now have the S7 and it crashes all the time and still does not sync. Why.",
        "Bought it for the beauty and Google fit integration. It's a beautiful watchface but Google fit does not work. Premium is a scam, tried rebooting the watch and phone, also resync of apps. But alas!",
        "Very pleasing to look at with good functionality at the same time. Some additions I'd like to see are a brightness slider, ##latest heart rate (based on your time interval settings)## now removed, step counter. The \"OK Google\" middle touch feature doesn't work for me  Why remove the heart rate monitor interval? That was one of the best features!",
        "I love the face design, so I purchased the premier version which unlocks some extra icon on the watch face, these icons link with Google Fit in the setting up app, but when I touch step icon or heart rate icon on the watch face, it never sync with Google Fit's data. Always said: no data.",
        "I really like this one. Only thing I'm missing is the steps counter somewhere on the main screen (for example, somewhere under time). Thanks."

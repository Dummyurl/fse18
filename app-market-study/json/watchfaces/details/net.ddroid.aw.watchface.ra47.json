        "Bad battery drain issues. I would like a refund",
        "Looks that kill... I love the look of these (and several other) Smartwatch Bureau faces for my LG Urbane.  However, I had to stop using it because something when I'm using it is destroying my battery.  I used to go all day, with 20% left by nighttime, with faces from two other popular face apps.  When I started using SB's faces (and I used two that matched this style), I would be recharging by 1pm.  I was resorted to returning to the other devs faces, and watch life has returned to normal.  If there is any way to fix...",
        "Must have",
        "This is a very attractive looking face and I'm happy with it apart from one flaw. When on automatic mode, it sets the weather location to my original home address rather than the actual location. This is annoying when I travel, as the weather is telling me what it's like at home, not where I am now! Another point is that it would look even better to have at least one more colour in the ambient mode, even something simple like changing the colour of the hands to make them stand out from the rather complex background.",

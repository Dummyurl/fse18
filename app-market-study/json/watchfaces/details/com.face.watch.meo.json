        "RGB Color select works great, no ads on watchface Edit: Re: No worries, I haven't used the watch face extensively but it's very nice looking, and I really appreciate that the face doesn't have ads on it.  Highly recommended to anyone considering it. It delivers and looks as good as you think it will.",
        "Cute I love this face on my Zenwatch, but when I have the hourly alert option selected it still shows the time instead of the eyes - which I was most excited about because I thought it was a really cute feature. Otherwise I like this watch face a lot.",
        "Lovely simple look Great simple look but really needs a date on face somewhere, surely not difficult to add. Nice design to use on occasion but i need date",
        "I have android wear. But it doesnt matter cuz app didnt even tried to connect my watch or asked premission. Doesnt work.",
        "Easy to use and love the color options.  Cute and works great on my Moto 360.",

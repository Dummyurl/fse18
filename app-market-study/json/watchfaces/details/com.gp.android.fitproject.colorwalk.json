        "Awesome! It's simple and awesome but would love a digital clock alternative :)",
        "Great design, difficult as a watch :P It has a great design and really like the changing colors but could there be an option for digital time not just analog? Or to have both analog and digital at the same time? I just find myself switching watch faces to actually check the time. If it werent for that then this would definitely be my primary watch face. Also enjoy the steps shortcut and animations :D",
        "Doesn't link to Fit App Tried multiple times but it just keeps saying \"install fit app\" even though it's been installed foe ages. Also it makes me pick a google account like 10 times before it even says that. :/"

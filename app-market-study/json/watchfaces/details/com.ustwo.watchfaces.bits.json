        "The new update making the time in the center larger while still having 6 complications is perfect. Definitely my favorite watch face.",
        "My favourite watchface as you can use so many compilations, but I would be amazing if there were even more, I would pay more for",
        "Updated and now the seconds are missing from digital time",
        "Newest update I can't make changes on my phone.  The analog clock sits right on top of the digital (or whatever they are I can't tell) one making both useless.  No longer shows missed calls.  No longer shows new messages.  No longer shows new emails.  I will be replacing this app (Which was my fave) and I pushed so many people to get.  Hold me. Oh!  And the battery doesn't expand to show phone battery % and the bit that looks like a bell doesn't expand either.",
        "Like most, the changes on this app have made it almost unusable. What used to be my fav watch face is starting to become the worst of them. The analog and digital watch face are overlayed on the same complication unless you use the weather background. You cannot see the battery percent from the phone. You cannot click on the weather complication to see the weekly forecast. You cannot click on the clock to set a timer. Used to be great, now I'm off looking for a new watch face.",
        "This used to be my favorite watch face, but after the latest update on Dec. 6th, I can no longer manage complications from my phone, and the digital time fails to properly update, leaving whatever time displayed at the point it was set up overlayed on top of the current time, making it unreadable.  I love this watch face! Please fix these issues!"

        "Gorgeous I hate watch faces which look great when on but look awful when the watch goes dim.. this one stays looking gorgeous in both states.. it looks great and I haven't noticed any increase in battery drainage than usual. This may be because I prefer watch faces with full colour when dim. Love it.",
        "Rework the dimmed display I'm giving you a 4 because I really like the watch face design, but the dimmed display kills the battery life. I'd like to see the dimmed display greatly refined or I would like to uninstall and receive a refund because I can't use as is.",
        "Eats Battery One of the nicer watch faces but it will destroy your battery. Maybe it's because of the use of colour during sleep mode?",
        "I like it but... Seeing that the date is at the top it would be great if the weather was integrated somehow and Aldo if it could be completely dimmed to a black and white screen once sleeping..."

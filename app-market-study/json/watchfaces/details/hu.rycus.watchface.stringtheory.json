        "This wach face is so nice but have a very fast animation! And this is not good!",

        "Thank you     شكرا لك",
        "Great tanks",
        "App Does what it says it does. Only concern is that the animations slow down the watch. It has 12 and 24h format, you can choose how many strings are animated and if the strings are constantly animating or animate every second. Either way, really cool and very much so recommend."

        "Good, could use some improvements in ambient mode This is a really nice watchface! I'd appreciate it, though, if it has some settings for the watch hands when in ambient mode. With just the outlines as it is now, sometimes it can be a bit difficult to read.",
        "Mmmh. I remember a watch with rubber band from Italy name \"O'clock\", that have very similar design with simOclock. But I always appreciated hard work and I do hope you could provide plain black background for amoled screen like G Watch R. Now the black one seems like just dark grey. And ability to change between watch and phone battery info would be greatly appreciate. Thanks.",
        "On my polar m600 the black background is more of a grey which doesn't look so great in my opinion. Also the default template choices don't update properly and I had to change the appearance in the custom setting tab",
        "It's a nice watch face but yet I don't feel it's simple enough for me. I do like that the watch face shows the battery percentage even if that downgrades it's simplicity",
        "Unable to see app I installed it but unable to trace it in my mobile, using nexus 5",
        "Cannot see watchface No app in app drawer, no watch face in android wear or on watch itself."

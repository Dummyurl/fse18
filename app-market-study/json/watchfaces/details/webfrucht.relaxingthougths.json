        "Funny... If you're looking for exact time go elsewhere, the description sets up the appropriate expectation. I love the watch face and it's comic feel",
        "No use I have synced, uninstalled, installed, resynced. It will not show up on my moto360. I cant refund in so basically a waste of money",
        "Very nice. Would rather have app settings on phone.",
        "Lots of features Love it.  Lots of options for customization. Works great!",

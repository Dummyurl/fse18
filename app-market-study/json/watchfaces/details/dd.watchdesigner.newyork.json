        "Best Watch Faces Every watch face by Sol is beautiful. They are crisp and full of light and color. If you are constantly searching for a nice watch face, I'd give this a go. I also have the Cappadocia watch face. That one is a little more battery intensive. Nonetheless, awesome watch faces, looks incredible on my Moto 360. Woo first review!",

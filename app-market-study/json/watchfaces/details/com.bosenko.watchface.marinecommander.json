        "Lots of useful features. Battery drain definitely low as advertised. Some of the text could be a bit larger, but other than that a nice daily use face.",
        "Great watchface ðŸ˜Š would like weather icons to switch color with the color themes otherwise awesome watchface",
        "Look really nice on my Diesel watch. Please add a red theme in the next update.",
        "This is my main go-to face.  It offers almost everything I want.  I love the look, the widgets and third party complication support.  It has the best battery life of any third party face that I have tried. The only thing I could ask for would be customizable shortcuts.... Just two or three to make it easy to launch alarms and timer, etc.  But even without that, it's nearly perfect.  Thank you!",
        "I think this is the best looking watch face I've seen so far. One thing I'd like to see is the ambient display to have an auto brightness setting of some sort. I don't know how I feel about having one setting especially due to battery drain on the always on screen. Other than that, I have no complaints thus far. Love it.",
        "Best looking watch face in a while however I would like to make a couple of suggestions/comments:  1. watch and phone battery indicator should be a separate complication as not everyone uses google fit. currently, you have to use google fit to have watch/phone battery indicators. i have a HW2 classic and have to use a 3rd party complication which doesn't show battery indicators  2. again, i have a HW2 classic and have just updated to 8.0 oreo. something is causing my battery life to decreased by 50% since using this watch face. the only thing that i can think of is either the weather or compass complications. i switched over to another watch face and battery life returned to normal."

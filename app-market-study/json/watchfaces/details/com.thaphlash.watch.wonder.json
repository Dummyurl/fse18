        "I love the look & logo. I just wish the watch hands were located on front layer instead of under the logo. Unable to see most of the time. Also wish the widget displayed fonts were larger, barely able to see steps taken.",
        "I couldn't get the app on my phone to adjust the settings (even following the intrusions provided). When I tried to open on my phone from the watch it just opened the play store screen which is not useful.",
        "So I want my money back cause I can't even use this app. Nothing shows up on my phone or watch. So I'd like a refund ASAP",
        "Crashes all the time on my lg urbaine annoying",
        "not what i expected it to but its fine",
        "Love my new face watch. After downloading on your phone u need to install it on ur watch in the app section !"

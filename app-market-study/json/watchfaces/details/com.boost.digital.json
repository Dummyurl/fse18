        "Great This is a really great digital watch face. The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is the lack of options to be able to turn on and off certain features, like the weather or the steps/stopwatch/etc. widgets. Just giving the user a choice would improve functionality greatly with no detriment to user experience.",
        "Love it! I love this watch face...I especially love how the seconds tracer goes across the flat tire instead of disappearing below... Clean look, great color. It's perfect!"

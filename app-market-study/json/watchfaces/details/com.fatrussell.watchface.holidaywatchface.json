        "I like that it had different Christmas watch faces.",
        "Another essential watch face Each of these creations puts a smile on people's faces when they notice the designs and all the little details in them",
        "Cute &love, but, only Rudolph shows time+date/steps/battery% left. Others only date except snowman which has nothing but pic. Add same features as Rudolph for 5 stars ;)",
        "Great watch face for my wife but the ambient displays are dull, and they need at least the date displayed either on both displays or at least on the lit display (only Rudolph has it at all)",
        "Hey, cute face!! I really like the watch faces. They are a simple design and festive. I am not a fan of how they look in \"Ambient Mode\" though.",
        "Would like the date on all the watch faces."

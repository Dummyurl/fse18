        "updates are so buggy",
        "Literally doesn't do anything for me. It only shows one plain watchface and doesn't show what I select, it doesn't change or announce the time or anything else it's supposed to do.",
        "It doesn't really work",
        "I would definitely give it a 5, and will, except their digital watch leaves a bit to be desired. I prefer digital, as watch hands are not always easy to see in a fast paced work environment. I love that you can change the font and time position, however, I wish you could change the color of the writing, as white doesn't show on all faces. Additionally wish you could change font size to bigger or smaller. Also, top and bottom positioning are VERY top and bottom, which doesn't look great on a round face watch.",
        "Great app for my smart watch. Only one thing stops me from giving a 5. It uses wifi only to transfer watch faces automatically. I would expect it to switch to Bluetooth when no wifi but instead the watch faces just stop changing until I get a wifi signal again. This should be fixed. There's no reason not to use Bluetooth.",
        "Very basic. I had problems tranfering watchfaces to my watch, was not worth the effort. Now uninstalled, there are alot better watch face apps out there."

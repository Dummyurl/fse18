        "Average at best Looks nice but the calendar never updates to newer appointments and the watch hands are difficult to read.",
        "No Watch Face to Rate I wish the watch face would show up with the others, so that I can activate it on my 1st gen. Moto 360! It doesn't show up anywhere to set it as my \"face\". All this app does is direct you to set the watch face in Android Wear, but it isn't available as an option within the Android Wear app. Once I'm actually able to try out the \"face\" and it's features, then I'll return and update my review.",

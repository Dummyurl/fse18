        "I really like this face allot. It is very stable and doesn't use much battery on my Huawei Watch(AW 2.0 preview) and LG Watch Sport.  The step counter can be a tad difficult with certain color schemes but overall: Great Job!",
        "Like this face but the battery drain is terrible. I was getting 2 days of usage on a single charge. Using this face I can only get 10 hours.",
        "Cool but one flaw The app uses so much battery on my phone. Please fix",
        "How can I put this watch face on my Wear24? It is not selectable after installing it.",
        "I like the look of the watch face but can't install it to my watch. Huawei watch 2. Not in the Android wear app.",
        "Cool face! but I cant edit the face,I keep getting a licensing error and it closes please help! Thanks"

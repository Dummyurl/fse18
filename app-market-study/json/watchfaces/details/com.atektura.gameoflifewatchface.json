        "Works Animation still eventually hangs if let it run for more than a few seconds. (Is it supposed to do that?) Time now correctly displays after the watch's screen turns up, so its functional now.",
        "Amazing idea ans implementation I love Conway's Game of life(as any nerd does) and was happy to pay for this app. Once i realized that it used the time ss the initial configuration I was supremely impressed. What a wonderful watch face.",

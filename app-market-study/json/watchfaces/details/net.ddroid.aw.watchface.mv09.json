        "Room for improvement I absolutely love this watch face! There's one problem though, and I don't know if it's a problem with the watch face or Android wear, but sometimes when in ambient mode, it doesn't draw black and white mode. The screen gets \"stuck\" when the screen goes into ambient mode.. I'd love to see this issue resolved! Great work!",

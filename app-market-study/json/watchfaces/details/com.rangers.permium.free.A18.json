        "Very Nice!!! Beautiful but one small incompatibility on my Huawei - the red second hand bisects the the watch Numbers whereas on my Urbane it rotates outside of them. Also would prefer a better looking ambient mode since the main face is so nice! Is there a pay version w more features?",
        "nice, but hands might be tricky to read when they are at bottom of face... could do with timeout setting too",
        "Settings app crashes Lovely watch face but crashes",
        "Cool watch face but it doesnt have any alerts . If somone contacts to you yo cant fell any motions from youre warch",
        "Watchface is pretty nice... But need more battery optimization... It doesn't last for a day...",
        "Cool. I like this one ."

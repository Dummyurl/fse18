        "What is this? It didn't work on my device (Nitro A311). Installation was successful, but no icon was created on homescreen and in app drawer. In playstore also, after installtion, there is only option to uninstall it, option to open it is not available.",
        "Looks cool! Works on my Huawei watch just fine. I can't see how to add the digital time in the middle like the picture though.",
        "No one seems to understand this is for a smartwatch and not your phone. This doesn't work if you don't have a smart watch (obviously) so ignore all the bad reviews",
        "Man it must be difficult for a dev with a low rating for no reason other then people just not reading what the are downloading.",
        "Looks ok. Need to get rid of second circle,  as it gets stuck in ambient mode, so it looks off.",
        "How How do I start this? It makes no sense. I can't even open it."

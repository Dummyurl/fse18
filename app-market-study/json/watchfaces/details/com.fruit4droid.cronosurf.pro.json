        "The 5 side-buttons disappeared after I selected \"Dark Background\".  De-selecting didn't restore them so I un-, then re-installed Cronosurf...still no go.  I was happy to buy the Pro version. This gamble worked, all buttons are back. The problem seems to be with the code, not the hardware.  My phone is a Huawei Nova Plus, Android V7.0  Otherwise, Developers, take a bow for an excellent application. Thank you.",

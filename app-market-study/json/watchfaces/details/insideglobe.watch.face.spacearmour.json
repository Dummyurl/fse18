        "Good looking face but has issues. The battery icon on the watch reads 63% but my watch is 100% charged. The heart rate monitor does not work neither does the step counter so not happy with paying £0.73 for something that does not do what it says on the tin. Get these problems ironed out and you will have a watch face that will take some beating.",
        "You have no right Had this watch face until it decided it was a good idea to send me notifications to download other applications. Well the first notification I got resulted in their app being removed, and will never be downloaded again.",
        "Thanks for the notification spam It was the perfect reminder to uninstall your junky watchface.",
        "Needs some dim options and colors."

        "I also was unable to get changes to sync after purchasing premium.  Thanks to Jason Robinson's review I was able to change the face also only when my watches screen was on and active.  I have a Moto 360 First Gen.  Otherwise this is a beautiful minimalist watch face that I really enjoy. I'd also like to remove the name after purchasing premium.  Lastly,  the second hand star does not seem to work on the blue nebula face no matter what I configure it to.",
        "Great looking watch face.   However,  after upgrading to premium I could not get it to sync my setting changes to my watch face.  After trying a few things,  including a reboot of the watch,  I discovered that I could sync the settings only when my watch face was active (visible screen).  I have the original Huawei watch.  Also, after updating to premium it would be nice to be able to remove the name from the watch face, as well as have a few more color options.",
        "Bought the premium version and nothing works. Can't change anything don't waste your 2$",
        "Huawei watch 2.  Paid for premium and will not change watch face. As not bought from play store I cannot click for a refund...... Waste of time.",
        "Didn't work on my Huawei watch 2.",
        "Misleading, this watch does only red colour, no interaction, horrible"

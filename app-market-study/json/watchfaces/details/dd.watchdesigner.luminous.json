        "Always liked this watchface but, since Wear 2.0 update, if you long-press to go to settings, the watch returns in square face mode on my LG Urbane, which has a round face. Hopefully a bug which will be fixed soon.",
        "Looks great Simple and looks like a glow in the dark watchface.  I really like it...I would go 5 stars if it had a weather option.",
        "Why do I have to install another app to use a watch face. Stop adding more steps to use watch.",
        "Won't download to gear s2 It won't go on my watch. Thought it looked cool but looks like an app on my phone but doesn't download on my watch or have the option to on the app. Very very very dissatisfied. Give me my money back",

        "The best My favorite watch face and the only custom I use. Battery was approximately the same after my day of work compared to standard moto 360 faces, from the comments it seemed people had issue. Lots of customization, utility and it looks great. One annoying issue though, the time and date are on the bottom of the screen so when there's a notification (or in my case, Pandora which always shows) the most critical part is blocked. A nice option would be to put the battery displays on bottom and time on top. Please!",
        "Had to uninstall Nice watch face but recently has become such a battery hog, I've had to stop using it. My Urbane would previously go 2, nearly 3 days without a charge, I don't get through a day with this face running. I've pared back some of the actions, like disable location and the ISS updates but it still kills the battery. Great looking but no longer useable unfortunately.",
        "Awesome -- Just One Request I don't like many watchfaces, but I love this one.  One request: Would like to be able to set the Digital Clock to an alternate time zone.  Even if it were just an hour offset (\"+2 Hours\" \"-3 Hours\" etc), would be sweet.  Cool watch face!",
        "Super watch face I'm a bit of a watch face addict and can tell I'll be wearing this for a long time to come. Great theme colors and detail although it would be great to be able to zoom in on your location somehow I can't really see the UK from the distance it's set at. The news tickertape is a nice touch. Well done.",
        "Nice idea, but not an atlas. US centric. Doesn't adapt to anywhere out of North America. I'm Scottish, and it's not really got any relevance to me. I've uninstalled it.  Can I have a refund?",
        "Best Watch Face I've come across I never review anything on the market place but i have to say this watch face is the best one out there. Good looking, smooth and informative interface."

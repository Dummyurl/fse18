        "Better low battery mode would make it five star The face is beautiful but the low battery mode is not simply black and white hands (which would be ideal) it is like a glitched version of the face with partial nameplate, minutemarks and gears in blue and white plus the hands. Just make low power mode crisp white hands on a black face guys!",
        "Im an engraver Just downloaded the face not sure how it works 3 stars for now, but I'm a hand engraver, and I'm going to hook this watch up free feel to check out my website and follow along Instagram or facebook to see this baby when it's done, so this face should fit perfectly GunEngraver.    dot.   com",
        "Please update!!!!!!!!!!!! Will give 5 stars after update. Please update it no longer works!  .update. dev updated face to work with android 5! So awesome! Thank you! I would love to see color options with this face. Red blue black green gold etc.",
        "Beautiful watch face Dev has updated the watch face and now it works with the new version of Android Wear. Excellent and fast support. GREAT JOB!",
        "Cost more then others So let me check it out.  There are a few gears that move in sync with appropriate time unlike other watchfaces that do not. So that's a plus..",
        "Runs great after last update and looks great too!"

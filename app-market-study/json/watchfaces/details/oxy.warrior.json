        "Awesome new release! I LOVE the color combination on this face. It's reminiscent of the Dials face for the Moto 360, but much more bold. Ambient mode looks clean on the Moto 360 v2, and I love the way the dial tick marks follow the watch's face contour. It has an option to remove the logo, and contrary to previous reviews, it DOES work. I appreciate the second time zone option, but maybe add a digital option for it? Still, this is a great debut!",

        "Used to work but stopped. This was a great app for a while but it no longer tells the correct temperature. WeatherBug on my Droid Turbo says it's 95 in NYC but on my Moto 360, it says it's 79. Slightly off! :( It is also displaying the moon even though it is 4:30 in the afternoon.",
        "For a watch app that's made for weather, its not working.  I spent $$ for the pro but should have reviewed these comments before.  The weather is stuck at 100 degrees.  Had almost everything I wanted.....but stuck watching incorrect weather.",
        "DON'T WORK \"error\" failure to connect with google play. Device: Samsung Gear S.  Im looking for digital watch that has battery meter and temperature. Thought this was perfect. Fix bugs or offer suggestions and I'll be HAPPY!!",
        "75% functional Paid for full version. Forecasts stopped updating after a week or two. Tried all the recommended fixes: uninstalling/reinstalling, resetting my phone, etc. Bummer it doesn't work for me (Samsung Gear Live). There aren't enough Android Wear forecast options out there (that work).",
        "Temp is WAY off This could be a nice watch face except the weather is way wrong. It says it's 100 degrees with a high of 999 degrees. It's 60 outside. I'm using the Yahoo weather to pull it from. Too bad. Looks like app hasn't been updated in almost a year. Google needs to pull this from the store.",
        "Works great on my LG G Watch. But I paid for Premium version and the free background look better I'm starting to think I got ripped off. Would be 5 stars if premium had better wallpapers and could keep the screen on longer"

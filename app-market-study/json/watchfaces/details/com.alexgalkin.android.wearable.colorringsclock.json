        "When first installed, it was crashing on the watch pretty much all the time. Sent a bug report to the developers and within a couple of days a fixed version was released.  Running for a week or more now, no issues.  Nice clean watch face with ability to customise quite easily, I like it.",
        "Nice in general, longer hours and minutes hands and it will be perfect",
        "Very cool I really like this. How often does it check heartbeat? Be nice if it had date on ambient too. Pedometer should sync with what's on watch as more accurate than on phone. Cool though!",
        "Really cool watchface Customization is awesome. Developer obviously put a lot of work into the options and the ease of using them. Don't let the lack of reviews deter you - get this out and you won't be disappointed!"

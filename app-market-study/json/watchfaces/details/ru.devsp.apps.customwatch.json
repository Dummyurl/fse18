        "Has potential Great customizability, one problem though - you have to have the watch on for the settings to take effect, this is also valid for ambient mod. Secondly - the battery indicator isn't as customizable and it shows. You can't select percentage only, can't change size or font, you can't move it.... The watch face and app also crash occasionally, wound up having a black screen as a watch face once. Using this on a moto 360 1. If these things get fixed I give it a 5 :)",
        "I thought the purpose of this was tip create a custom watch face for my watch, not create a watch face that can only be viewed in the app, basically pointless."

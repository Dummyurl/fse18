Although the 28-day cycle is the same length as the average woman's menstrual cycle and was originally described as a \"female\" cycle (see below), the two are not necessarily in any particular synchronization.Each of these cycles varies between high and low extremes sinusoidally, with days where the cycle crosses the zero line described as \"critical days\" of greater risk or uncertainty.(refer from wikipedia, see more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythm)For Android 6.0(and higher) phone usersNeed to do following setup procedure after installation.http://androidwearface.com/for_android6_users/InstallationIt will be installed on your watch automatically from your phone paired with your watch after a short time and please wait.After installation,you can choose the watch face from the setting menu.Or just long tap on the current watch face screen,so watch face selector screen will open.More watch faces- Visit our exclusive watchface collection for Android Wear on the Play Store http://goo.gl/RITBygPlease note- If you don't like this model please cancel your order in 15 minutes.

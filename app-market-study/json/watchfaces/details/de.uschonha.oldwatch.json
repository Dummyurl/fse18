        "This watchface is why I bought a smart watch.  Charming.",
        "Use to work on my lg watch but now it does not have tried everything. Works on lg phone. But will not download to lg ware.",
        "The new frame looks nice.",
        "Thanks to a quick response from the developer, was finally able to get it working. I love the look of the face, but not sure about the simple sleep face, I mean, REALLY minimalistic. Maybe it'll grow on me. Otherwise great developer customer support!",
        "Absolutely gorgeous watch face.  I love really complex, high-tech faces, but have an equal love for the traditional. This one makes you feel like you have an old, rare watch on your wrist."

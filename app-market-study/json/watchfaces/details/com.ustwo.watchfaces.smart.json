        "Great watch faces! \"Next\" is my favourite, but it reverts to a boring old analogue face when there is no event coming up soon. I love the typography and the way it looks in ambient mode, If you could make it so that instead of reverting to an analogue version, it just has digital time displayed using the same style as the regular text on this watch face, I'd gladly give it a 5 star rating!",
        "Brilliant watch faces. \"Next\" is my favorite. I have a busy schedule and I love being able to see what's coming up at a glance. I actually really like the simple, elegant face that displays when there's nothing imminent. The Ustwo designers really understood how to take advantage of Android Wear to create something that shows a view of time, in a beautiful, intuitive, glanceable way, and is also novel and couldn't have been done mechanically. Kudos.",
        "Love these faces but 'versus' does not work, it fails to show yesterday's step count. Tried reinstalling, reconnecting to Fit, clearing cache. Nothing is working. Any ideas Ustwo??",
        "A beautiful design that is more than 'just clever'. At a glance planning for keeping me on track for upcoming meetings. Then I switch to the weather face to plan my outdoor activities.",
        "Creative, beautiful, unique, and useful.  These faces are a few years old, but thier distinctive look only matures as watch screens get sharper and more vibrant.  All of ustwo's work is beautiful to look at.",

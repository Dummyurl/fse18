        "Great apart from one thing Love this watchface but would like to be able to have it not show day and date on the dimmed version. It looks messy when notifications are showing or music info for whatever I am playing. If that gets changed this is an instant 5 star. EDIT IN RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER REPLY - Was not negotiating for stars at all, simply giving reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars in case anyone else was interested in buying it and wanted an honest review as for me that issue is a deal breaker.",
        "Perfect look on moto 360 Had probs loading due to android wear not this app but dev responded swiftly to help out. Now working fine and design looks really nice. Very impressed with customer service too.  Thanks",
        "Decent The description stated this was customizable, which I took to mean you could replace widgets like phone battery with steps or weather. The only thing this allows to be customized is the color and date/time format. It looks very cool, though, so I may keep it.",
        "Great watch face but! I really like this watch face, but it is missing an option to lock the color. Also the 2 empty spots could have been used for weather information.",
        "Tony Stark I'm a huge Marvel fan and geeking out hard right now lol.",
        "I don't like this watch face my date and month does not show up I have a square watch face very hard to see the numbers I think this watch face is made for a round watch"

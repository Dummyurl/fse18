        "Save your money Don't waste your time or money. Very little options and keeps crashing.",
        "Excellent design, but it consistently shows a wrong battery percentage for my phone(Note3).",
        "I like it, but I want it to display 24 hours. Can't get that to work",
        "I like it but hard to figure out How do you make it so it fits the square watch face",
        "Not for squares... The watch face looks fine, but is a circle with black corners. Not much for options either.",
        "Nowhere near worth a dollar. The paid version of the app simply unlocks the option to change the theme of the face to a lighter setting. Cool concept, but poorly executed."

        "Because love the step counter feature I enjoyed being able to snap a screenshot of my watch face and send it to a friend. Now I can't do that. On the Google wear screen it shows all of my watches but it shows a watch face that I'm not using above instead of the Magnum face. Is there a fix to enable this feature? If I try to snap a screenshot it tells me it's sending a screenshot request but nothing ever happens.",

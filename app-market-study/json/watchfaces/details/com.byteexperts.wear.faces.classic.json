        "Very nicely rendered face but is of limited use to me. My biggest issue is ambient mode. (Ambient mode is designed to save your battery by turning off pixels, animations, and prevent screen burnout.) The ambient mode on this watch simply freezes the mostly-white screen, raising my concerns for pixel burnout. Overall excellent artwork and a beautiful watch but I will probably not use it until ambient mode issues are addressed.",

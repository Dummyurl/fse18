        "Seems ok at first use, but when using the stopwatch the numbers aren't a fixed width so the display wibbles about when a 1 is displayed. That's a pretty basic thing to get wrong and is really annoying.  It would be nice to set the ambient brightness also. And be able to turn off the indicators",
        "I have a tag connected. Cant understand how to view fitness, steps, HR,.. and why there is a menu and prev and next buttons when they do nothing.",
        "Great watchface. I love the look and functionality Only thing stopping a 5 star review is that the digital second time display won't hold a timezone and keeps reverting to local time",
        "Can't recommend for ZenWatch 2. The guard watch face menu doesn't appear. If its a configuration setting, it's not obvious.",
        "Works great on moto360. Had an issue with the weather. Was related to another app hijacking weather queries. Fixed now. I have multiple faces by this company and all of them are in my rotation.",
        "ZenWatch 2 Weather was wrong.  No integration with fitness other than Google.  Interactive are not customizable with normal watch functions timer, stopwatch, watch battery, waste of my money."

        "Goodlooking, cheap, customizable texts (remove BL3CK and write down your name !)... I'm a fan ! However, I would appreciate if we could see the oncoming watch alarm displayed on the watchface....",
        "Another excellent face from BL3CK I like their other face called Porto a little more, but this one is still worthy. Elegant and simple, it makes the watch look like a real watch. Easy on the battery as well.",
        "The watch hands and back face seem a bit fuzzy on the edges on my Moto 360."

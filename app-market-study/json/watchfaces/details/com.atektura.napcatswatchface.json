        "I am absolutely in love with this app as my watchface. the only things I would want more would be an option to have a square layout for the text/numbers, and the option to set it to keep a single color rather than change every day. but! this is still an adorable watch face nonetheless, and I appreciate it greatly!",
        "Widget only 1x1 Purchased this to use on my phone as a widget, but won't resize beyond 1x1. Please fix and will adjust review!",
        "Perfect",
        "Funny cats and creative I wish I could customize some settings. I would like to disable the black ambient mode.  I use the moto 360.  In fact the main reason I bought the watch face was to get away from all these dark watch faces.",
        "Perfect Adorable, simple and soothing. Now I need some warm milk",
        "Love it! A but simple for how much it costs, but it's still awesome!"

        "It has one big problem Liked the idea, but for me the big problem is I have the display turned off (to extend battery life), so when I tap the screen at first I see a incorrect time before it updates.",
        "Price is right. I wish there were options I wish I could modify it to my preference. Get date, day, battery level, other things.  But its free and it does the job.",
        "Awsome Perfect watch face, my one and only issue is that I can't change out of 24 hour format, would rate 5 stars with that option",
        "Looks cool Great watch face, I wouldn't mind having some settings to change from 24hr time to 12hr time. The animation is a nice touch.",
        "Kinda garbage No 12 hour mode?! I'm stuck with a 24hr digital clock?",
        "Finally! OK, I'm lame and nostalgic. It's basic, simple, and simply perfect."

        "Moto 360 classy I have a champagne moto and this looks the best of ALL gold faces. One problem is it seems to use a lot of battery and somehow facer is also draining my battery while using this face, but not through facer?! Still, happy I bought it.",
        "Nice. The MOST sophisticated look on ASUS ZEN watch on the market now! It would be state of the art if somehow to add battery and missing calls.",
        "Misaligned on moto 360 latest update",
        "Refund I installed it and don't like it, but there is no refund option",
        "Off centered Love the dim mode, but the second hand is off centered in my LG R. Hopefully the developer will fix this soon",
        "Not as shown in pictures Where is the version of the watch face without the frame?"

        "Super sweet design!¡!",
        "Updating my review.  Installation was a little wonky on the first attempt, but smooth on the second.  Set permissions on my phone for location based weather and that was it.  Beautiful and simple interface on watch for settings and a clean looking watch face have earned this a 5 star rating from me.  I looked for a good material design watch face long ago, and this one fits exactly what I was looking for.  It seems to be good on battery life, although I will wouldn't be upset to have a phone battery indicator in addition to the watch battery.",
        "Very nice and clean design. Would like the current temperature display on the main screen though - maybe opposite battery indication.",
        "Really like the simplicity of the material design of this watch face. It is nice to have the weather and battery status available at a glance. Definitely work trying if you like the material design.",
        "I absolutely love the design of the watch face. I just wish that it had the ability to show the phone's battery and notifications on ambient mode.",
        "Pretty nice Nice, clean, easy to read watchface. Only thing worth mentioning is that the date shows up ending in 'th' even when it should end in 'nd' or 'rd' so 23th of September instead of 23rd for example ."

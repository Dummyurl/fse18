        "I love it, however I was disappointed that there was no 12-hour option. Other than that, great watch.",
        "Good colorful basic face! Wish you could change time format, maybe see battery level. Very pretty and smooth.",
        "I really need to see date, so it will be 5 stars if you enable us to make some modification.",
        "A nice face Tornado looks great and works well.",
        "Very good",
        "Really attractive looking and fluid movement - it just needs some tap actions so you can see calendar, weather, steps, etc.  Keep working at it..!!  :-)"

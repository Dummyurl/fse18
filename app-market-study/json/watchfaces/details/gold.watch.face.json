        "No Full Ambient The watchfaces are beautiful and realistic in high resolution smartwatches. I paid in hopes full ambient mode was a paid app option but at least on LG Watch Urbane it is not available. The upset is that because it is an in-app purchase, I can't get a refund. See I use all my watchfaces in full ambient otherwise it beats the purpose for me. I recommend Weareal watchface as a great alternative for that.",
        "Nearly perfect. Just like you can see in the pictures, it is very nice, and well worth the praise it is getting from pretty much everyone.  I love skeleton watches and have been on the lookout for a watch face that has skeleton features, and actually looks good. This is the first! The option to remove the tourbillon is nice as well (not that I ever would!)  One thing I would like added if possible is a setting which allows adjustment of the outside golden rim. On the Moto360 it kind of looks like there are two rims with this watch face, so a setting which could make it smaller, or even remove it entirely would be an awesome addition.",
        "Wouldn't show up It says it's for the moto 360 and other watches. I have the LG G watch R and after 24 hours the watch face still never showed up for me. I rebooted both devices but still no luck",
        "Finally shows up For those having issues getting it to show, it didn't populate on my list for almost 10 min after install. Not sure why. Changed my rating to reflect this. Don't uninstall and reinstall. Just give it some time.",
        "Beautiful face gone in a blink of an eye Shuts off after 10 seconds and defaults to a ho, hum dull-white something. Come on, charge me 2 bucks and let me choose the timeout settings.",
        "Doesn't support LG G Watch R It's unfortunate that this watchface doesn't work on my LG g watch r. It's the only watchface from my library of watchfaces that crashes and doesn't work. I'm Hoping you guys make it g watch compatible."

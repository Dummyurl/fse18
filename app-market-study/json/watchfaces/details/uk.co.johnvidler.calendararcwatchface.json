        "New daily driver Update : stopped using face due to lack of ambient cards. Waiting for an update.... Awesome concept,  can't wait for future releases...  One question,  my notifications don't stay visible on the watch after it dims...  Is that something with the watch face?  My stock faces didn't act this way. Also agree,  need ability to increase font size and battery meter icons. Thanx",
        "Love being able to see the different calendar options.  5th star if you offer the option to specify different text size.  For my old eyes,  I'd consider the numbers on the time 'Medium' but the Day of week, day of month etc 'Small'.  The current events view should mostly likely have similar text size options.  Would appreciate a Small, Medium, Large, Maybe Extra large option for text sizes.  .   If given a preference I'd most likely not show the 'Arc' branding.  My watch is the LG G Watch.",
        "Awesome app! This app is extremely useful! As someone going through Android wear udacity course to try and implement something similar, I am super pleased to see that's it's been made already! Won't stop me from trying to figure out how you made it possible though!",
        "Most functional android wear app yet Thank you. This is an obvious win. Now please make it amazing... I'd like to get rid of the shadow/3d effects, Id like the battery guages to go into a black and white mode or be subtle all of the time, Id like to remive the word \"arc\" as it just clutters the screen, obviously Id like to be able to atleast change colors or even watch face styles entirely while still seeing the calendar arcs. I would actually like this as an overlay onto other wear watch faces. Regardless, thank you.",
        "I'm pleased I got this app way back. But I find myself looking for alternatives and I don't know that I'd buy it right now. Wear 2.0 complications would be a nice upgrade for which I would pay. If there were an arc to represent precipitation probability, or the Accuweather MinuteCast, that would be magnificent.  If we're throwing in more arcs, may as well include arcs for fitness tracking.",
        "Dark mode Issue Great to integrate calendar in the interface! However on dark mode the event has shadow effect that causes the words unreadable, thus defeats the purpose. Please fix this as a priority over all other issues! Really important! Picture in play store shows diff color backing for diff events, don't see that option. Will be helpful if there is this function!"

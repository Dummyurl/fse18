        "Really like the look and functionality. Only issue is I really really wish you could set weather location to zip code or city and not have to have GPS active for weather update",
        "Overall looks good. Only complaint is that some of the complications (weather for example) display off centre, which detracts from the visual.",
        "Works well, mostly. Compass stopped working and nothing I do restores it. Other apps from this developer are equally buggy.",
        "Miss aligned Icons",
        "One of the best i ever used. Thanks, guys!",
        "Good, could be great. This is my favourite watch face atm. Using it with a Huawei W1 watch. Settings don't update straight away on the watch. Specifically when you press the change colour button on the watch face, you have to do something else (swipe left and right) on the watch before you see the change. This does however work if you have just selected this face but after a while it stops working."

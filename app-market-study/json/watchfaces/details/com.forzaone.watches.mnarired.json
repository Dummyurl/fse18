        "Did I just buy this !!! Can barely see the hands. No contrast. Today is Sunday, July 9 , looks like on the left side it reads Dec. On right side of face it reads Sun. No date that I can see. Then again , I can hardly see what any of it actually reads. So far I have found no way to set or customize or change any of the dials. The best thing about this watch face is the pictures on the install page. They look Awesome. But as an actual useful watch face , IT SUX",
        "Bought a couple watch faces, now it won't push them to my watch at all. I have tried restarting, and uninstalling all of them. Nothing is working. Junk app.",
        "Good looking watch face, though the hands lack contrast and are therefore hard to locate.   It didn't appear for me in Android Wear on the phone or in the watch (LG Watch R with Wear 2.0), even after uninstall/reinstall and waiting, until I used Play Store on the watch to install it from the list of apps installed on the phone.",

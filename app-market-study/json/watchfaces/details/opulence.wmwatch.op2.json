        "best analog for square watch face i've seen. good functionality, but is quite the memory hog (not sure if this is watchmaker's fault or the face itself) and  I have to switch to a stock watch face before running multiple apps simultaneously (ie. Fit and Music) otherwise I get crashes on one or more of these apps.",
        "Another great watch face! As everyone has said, BEAUTIFUL and simple watchface with great options to change without the need of of opening a phone app.  **Thanks for the quick response and great work you have done on this watch face! **",

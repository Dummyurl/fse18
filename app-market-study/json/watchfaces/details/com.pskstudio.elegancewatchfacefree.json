        "The only nice looking watch face on my smart watch. Everything else looks too tacky, or too digital. I like having my watch look like a traditional watch face, but all the defaults look too cheesy with how 3D and bubbly they all look. This is simple, has a nice pointed look to the hands like a real watch, and a nice muted navy blue that doesn't look like an LCD generated polygon cartoon. Something an adult can appreciate for a change.",
        "Love this watch face -  one suggestion The look on this watch is beautiful. I tried trying with the color settings and it's just too difficult for the average Joe to mix colors and transparency for the color he/she wants. What would make this watch 5 stars is having various preset that can be used by the user. I'd even pay for that update.",
        "Its really dark Looks nice but its very dim || EDIT: thanks for the reply, I use a g watch r, I'm not sure why but it does seem dimmer in terms of brightness than other watch faces do",
        "Great under certain circumstances As an evening watch face it is lovely and elegant. During the daytime it is nearly impossible to see. As an everyday watch face it fails but for evening social occasions it is my favorite. I use it on an Urbane 2.",
        "Gorgeous looking dial but the ticking seconds hand made it into a quartz watch instead of a high-end wind up or automatic. Sorry but this won't be my daily.  Update:  You can purchase Elegance Watch Face Plus, which DOES include the sweeping seconds hand.",
        "Retard app. Doesn't even show up on android wear after installation. Nonsense."

        "This is the worst app ever. Upgraded to paid music library but could not pull my 1500 items of music from the free version to the paid. Paid because we wanted to be able to export a CSV file to print and take shopping so we wouldn't buy the same LP twice. Waste of money and the time it took to inventory 1500 LPs and CDs!!",
        "Not currently working, no recent updates App is incomplete and appears to be not in active development as the last version was over a year ago. Added one album and photo doesn't show on browse list.",
        "Very confusing. I want to play free prime music on my Amazon Echo and its not working",
        "Can this be used on Windows devices? I would like to be able to sync over several devices, through my Google account. Great little app, dirt simple to use.",
        "Good intention, needs lot improvement Can't put lyrics n track listing , no barcode scan , no back cover option, no offline editing & update etc...",
        "Simple and useful Easy to use.  Everything at a glance.  Bug fixes are better but not perfect yet."

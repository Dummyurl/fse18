    "description": "In the pre-modern Japan, Chinese zodiac had been used as a name of time. Chinese zodiac is represented by the name of animals and so on. They are rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and boar. Everyone is represented as single Kanji. The period of before and after midnight, a total of 2 hours, is called \"time of rat\". Every next 2 hours, it goes to the order of zodiac as \"time of ox\", \"time of tiger\", \"time of rabbit\" until the  \"time of boar\" and then return back to \"time of rat\". Even if it was so old days, two hours into one time period is too roundabout, it was called, such as every 30 minutes, for example \"one of dragon\", \"two of dragon\", \"three of dragon\" and \"four of dragon\", I heard.So, I suppose that if there was a smart watch in the era of NINJA, the watch face should have been surely like this.

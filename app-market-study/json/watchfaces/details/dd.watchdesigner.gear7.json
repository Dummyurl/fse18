        "I want to love this but... How have the makers of this not created an update even after so many people have complained that it's too dark?!    This has a beautiful design minus how dark it is.   Has 5 star potential but only deserves 3 stars till they fix the brightness.   Too bad really, I want to love this.",
        "Too dark, no option to set basic timeouts. Looks good on picture. Very hard to see in daylight, no customization options. Not worth it, it feels like a beta version or something...",

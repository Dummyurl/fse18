        "(Huawei here) Having an issue with phone battery not updating on the watch. Worth the 5 stars easily. It's among the best for simple, yet crucial key customization option. My favorite thing about this face is that I can make it super bland like a normal digital watch and have one tap away for an app, which is use to open the timer. - - - Only thing I'd truly like to see added, is a black themed ambient because I use my watch at night for work and even the \"outline\" has way too much white giving an obvious distracting glow. And I even use third party apps to darken the screen. (Wear Edge Control & SWApp True Dark).",
        "Liking this a lot, but I thought with it being interactive that I'd be able to launch my Weather app by clicking on the weather (temperature), but I can't seem to make that happen.",

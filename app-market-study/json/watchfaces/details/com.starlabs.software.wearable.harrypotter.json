        "I downloaded the app and the app didn't even come up with my other apps so I waited 20 seconds and switched off my tablet for 20 seconds and nothing happened Nothing came up and it's just a waste of time",
        "Amazing for HP fans! I love the fact that I can see my favorite symbols when ever I go to check the time! Just one question... I can't find it anywhere in my phone!",
        "Don't know how to work it How do u work it if I get a reply I will download it again but if not I'm uninstalling it",
        "Love it but wish we could personalize I love it but I wish we could customise parts of it or make it a digital instead of an analog",
        "I downloaded it, but I have no idea how to put it as a watch face on my Gear. Please help!!!",
        "Couldn't find it anywhere. Checked comments. Others can't either. No help provided. No thanks. This does not work like magic."

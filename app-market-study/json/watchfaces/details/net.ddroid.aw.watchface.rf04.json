        "I've just installed this watch face and I'm very impressed so far. Everything looks to be very accurate and the display looks nice and clear too. Read some complaints about the temperature forecast being inaccurate but I think it's just displaying kelvin instead of Fahrenheit or centigrade. That appears to be accurate too. Very happy.",
        "Took forever to get it onto the watch, as it doesn't appear in AW play store? Now that is finally working I have the bizarre 500 degree temps that others are complaining about. Otherwise it's a cool design and the customizations are nice. Fix the temps and I will increase to 5 star.",
        "Nice watch, highly customizable, the only downside that even if i choose Celsius for current temperature, forecast shows in Farengeit, please fix it and you will get 5 stars.",
        "Not installing on W atch Moto 360 or Huawei. Wasted Money.",
        "One of my favorite faces for my old g watch. Make a Frontire version and I'll definitely buy again",
        "Doesn't work well with AW2, refresh has troubles. On 1.5 It was mostly useless anyway, the weather too often goes blank during the day. I emailed the dev but got no response. Not recommended. Update: still not working as of 11/30/17."

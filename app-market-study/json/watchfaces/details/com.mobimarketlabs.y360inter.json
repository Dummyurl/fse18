        "Looks great but when I changed temperature from Celsius to Fahrenhiet the app crashed and froze. I uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.",
        "Brilliant app.. Very versatile!... A y chance you could have a football Oi on instead of Germany or so?",
        "Love this watch face, only fix need I see is SMS count does not reset after reading the message. Hope the developer would fix. Please fix.",
        "I believe you know that in ambient mode the brightness settings are relates to the text only, but there is no option to adjust marks and hands brightness. That eats up to 30% of battery a day. On my Moto 360 2nd gen 46mm your ambient mode looks ugly, not as it looks on your preview on the google play or at the settings page. The whatch face is perfect, but  not the ambient mode. And yes, antialiasing enabled.",
        "Nice visual design but poor implementation Sluggish UI. The app is very slow to react. Unpleasant experience",
        "Beautiful.  However, it is not recognizing wrist gestures on NB RunIQ.  Other than that, the best WF I have."

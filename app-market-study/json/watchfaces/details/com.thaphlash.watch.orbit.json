        "Beautiful Absolutely gorgeous, and love the customization options.  Keep it up!  My only wish is that there were separate options to customize ambient mode.  I would prefer ambient to look like the image above labelled ambient or the minimal one, instead of the same as active in black & white.  Also, the temperature is lower on watch and hangs partly out of the window.",
        "Instead of the nice trapizoid shaped weather \"window\", I just get some random 9-digit number that is all over the place and totally messing up the nice design. Unfortunately it took me too freakin' long to get the face to appear on my watch in the first place that I could not get a refund anymore. This really sucks!",
        "Not bad but weather bubble issues Weather bubble incomplete on moto 360.",
        "Great artwork and concept but.. It there anyway of making it stay on longer than a few seconds it switches off or onto ambient after 5 seconds ??",
        "Low Bit Ambient Mode not supported Looks bad on Moto 360 (2015) when Always on. Low Bit Ambient Mode seemingly unsupported.",
        "Wow This watch face is so imaginative. I love it. It's so simple to change the setting. I've gone and downloaded all of the watch faces cause they all look fab."

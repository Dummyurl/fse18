        "It used to be my favorite sport app but it's not anymore cause the \"alert\" option isn't available anymore so bad cause while working I didn't miss any score cause this app used to update me every minute. If you guys could fix that I would consider to rate it 5 stars. Meanwhile I am using another one (all football) which notifies me live scores. Thanks keep up the great work!",
        "It's pretty good. It has a lot of competitions and leagues available to be viewed. The only thing I'd like to request is the news being shown chronologically instead of the top news being on top. The \"latest\" section is not in chronological order too.",
        "Rated it one star and uninstalled immediately just because it has a  abusive advertisement which needs to be fixed ASAP. Without a doubt it gives update on point. But \"hypstar\" app Ad is bothering and INTOLERABLE. Highly abusive content. Please look into the matter.",
        "Wow. Amazing this is handa down the best soccer app out there. Results, news, stats, rumours. All in one. Fantastic Job!!",
        "I am upset since my transfer doesn't get updated and it says teams are interested players only in in loan this is ridiculous",
        "The live telecast is working no more. It makes me kind of hate this app now."

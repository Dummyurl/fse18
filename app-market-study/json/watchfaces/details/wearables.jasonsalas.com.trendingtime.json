The lesson here is that watch faces don't always have to be all about expressing the time itself - the emphasis for this app is on data, not the time.USAGE* Launch the Trending Time app on your paired smartphone and tap the \"Start updater\" button, which activates updates and syncs them with your watch.* You can safely close the app once the updater is running. If you need to stop updates, just launch the mobile app again and tap \"Stop updater\".* Select the \"Trending Time\" watch face on your smartwatch or from the Android Wear companion application.The update process fires once an hour. You can find out more about this app, see how it's built, and fork its code at https://github.com/jasonsalas/TrendingTime. We advocate open source!",

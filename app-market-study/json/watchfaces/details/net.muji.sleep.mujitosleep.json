        "UPDATE 5/27/2017: it still hasn't been updated to fix the problem, where the watch face still doesn't cover the full area of the watch face. It only covers a specific area from the top right corner leaving negative space after a specific amount of pixels. I've tried reaching out to the developer and have not gotten any sort of response whatsoever.",
        "Sound quality has some issue I found a issue with sound quality. At the very beginning, the chosen song's sounds crack and make buzz sounds. I wish there were more sounds that are available for many more different heart rate situations. Except that everything was good!",
        "Hey I've been using this app in the past just fine, but recently (about four to five weeks?) it can't be opened at all. Everytime I open the app it will crash. Please fix this!",
        "pretty good!! I was a bit confused at first... I didn't know you had to swipe to change the sounds. so it would be a good idea to tell the user that. there's nothing outstanding though, I don't use the hearbeat thing often because...... it's a bit of a hassle and the sounds are meh. I give this a 7/10",
        "Good but... The heart rate measurement is good but it's a hassle.  Why not have those sounds available the same way as the others? It's pretty frustrating when I want to a sound but my heart rate can't be detected. Sometimes I'm not able to measure my heart rate D;",
        "Issues.... I adore this app but.... Two issues with this app. Firstly, it sometimes won't stay on and keep refreshing itself so I can't get it to play. And secondly it randomly opens and starts without me doing anything and I can't get it to turn off. Please fix and I'll be giving this 5 stars for sure :)"

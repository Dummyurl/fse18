        "I really love the app; the kitty is so cute! However there is one draw back, the date doesn't update on the watch face unless I switch over to a new watch face and back to this one. It's a bit obnoxious given that I look to my watch to quickly tell me the date",
        "I really like this watch face and what I love is that the more steps you take, the more active the cat becomes. Unfortunately, I keep having issues with it not updating the correct day of the month.",
        "This is my favorite weekend watch face. A little fitness, an adorable fat kitty working hard to lose weight, and support for custom complications... What's not to love?",
        "The premise is great & although it's fun to have cats on my phone & watch the activity tracking is wildly inaccurate. Records steps with my phone/watch on a table at night charging & reported zero steps after 9 hours on my feet at work. Activity detection is enabled but been stuck on zero steps for a few days now, the changing faces/activity rewards seem completely random too & don't relate to anything. Probably going to uninstall. Shame. Pixel XL/Android 8.0/Sony SW3",
        "unfortunately the 2.0 update broke the complications...please fix this!!  i used to love this app",
        "On the new update, the date values does not get refreshed. Wrote to the developers but did not get any response"

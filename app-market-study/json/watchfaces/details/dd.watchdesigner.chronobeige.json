        "Never showed up on my watch... I waited 13 minutes and the watch face never showed up in the android wear app or on my moto 360. I also don't like that it places an icon in my app drawer, plenty of other watch faces do not do this. Fix those two issues and I'm sure I'll be buying quite a few of your watch faces.",

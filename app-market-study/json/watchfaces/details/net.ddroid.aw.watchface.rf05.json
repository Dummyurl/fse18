        "Bought this for my Huawei watch and I really love the design, but it does seem to chew through my battery.  One other problem I have is that the watch is supposed to show both zulu and roaming time - mine just shows zulu in both display areas. I would appreciate any hints on how to fix that?  Also when roaming the weather display is blank.  So because of those three niggles I can only give it 3",
        "Never showed up as an available watch face for my \"LG G Watch R\". Tried uninstalling/reinstall, nothing showing up on watch or on phone.  Watch face showed up after a few days.  Not sure the cause of the delay.  It's a little \"busy\" but displays the info I need to have handy when at work. I wish I could change the \"on\" colors to something more visible in daylight than green.  But other than that, it does what I need.",
        "Really like the watch face but room for improvement. I've been after an activity-based face for my Huawei watch and this ticks all the boxes. Yet to see how it's accuracy holds up when skiing, but it's the best I've found so far. Areas for improvement are: 1) Increase the polling time for speed and altitude (I'm going to be zooming!) 2) Remove the second hand for secondary clock (no point imo) 3) vibration feature if bad weather detected within next 3 hours in your location. 4) Touch points to open custom apps like skitracks, maps, weather, or zello. Thanks!",
        "Weather settings have been adjusted correctly in settings but my weather still shows as 588 degrees and so forth for the day. It also kills the battery in my Huawei sport.",
        "Edit: originally gave this 5 stars. Later I realized weather doesn't update, altimeter doesn't work, speed doesn't work, and can't get a response via email for support. I want a refund but since devs won't even respond for support it's unlikely. Would be the best face I've found if it worked but it doesn't. Be warned spend your money elsewhere. Shame I wanted a bunch of other watch faces from these guys but I've lost faith.",
        "Looks really awesome, assuming you want a busy watch face. If you don't why are you looking at this? :-) Heart rate indicator is cool, I haven't seen another watch face with that feature so I was a bit dubious but it works fine. It would be really nice to be able to set the second time zone, having it UTC only is a bit pointless if you're in the UK!"

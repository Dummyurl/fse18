        "Amazing watch face.  Loving it on my Huawei Watch.  Any possibility of it supporting the Gear S3?",
        "Great, tidy, minimalistic but colourful. I've had this watch face enabled since I bought it",
        "Can't use on android 8.1",
        "Looks Cool I like the look of it, and the option to choose either white or black face. I'd like to be able to use 12 hour format, though, rather than 24. Not being in the military or working for the government, I have little use for 24 hour format digital clocks.",
        "This would be my perfect watch face if i could get A.M. P.M. for the digital watch face and not always on 24hr format! make it happen please!",
        "Needs 12 hour mode Great looking watch face! It looks fantastic on my Moto 360 Zenwatch 2. However, there is no option for a 12 hour mode in digital, which makes this watch face useless for me. Nice try, but not quite there."

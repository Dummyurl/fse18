        "Looks slick, but it's got no customization options I'm a fan of the hexagon and color pattern, but I agree with others and say that it would be nice to see some customization options. Namely, a choice as to what is displayed and where, units, date format choices, etc... I'm not going to go and say that it needs touch actions, but that would be nice to see as well!",
        "I just bought this.  I like the look of it and it has everything that I want to have on the watchface. However a small disadvantage is that there is no customization at all. I don't mind the blue, but it would be nice to have some other color options to mix things up.  Overall pretty good watchface.",
        "Huawei Mate 7 Good start, but more options needed, and the temperature needs to be more accurate. What is this 32+ degrees when it's really 36 degrees???",
        "Good start Needs customization, can't use it at the moment for the lack of Celsius temperature",
        "Very cool But needs customization (especially colors) in order for it to be worth it. Also, on the v2 of the 360, the date only shows the month. The day is cut off."

        "Love it, but... ... It needs more options, and nerds many more options for the sub/secondary dials. Currently I'm assuming it shows temp in Celsius. I need Fahrenheit. I need to be able to show my phone battery on one and my watch battery on the other, with weather in the center. Aside, it could stand to see a small degree of graphical improvement and more options for the current settings as well, very well done handy games. I probably won't use it until those options are available, but well done all the same."

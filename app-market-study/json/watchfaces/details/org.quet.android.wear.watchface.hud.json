        "Like it but one flaw The overall look and usability of the watch face is awesome, however with the recent update there was supposed to be a configuration option via phone, however whenever I try to do this it says install settings app...not sure if this is a glitch or what",
        "Is this a joke? The square face looks nothing like the screenshots provided. The only setting it gives is a \"light face\" option. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and resynced several times. Nothing like what I paid for, very disappointed. *EDIT* It was somehow overlapped with another app and Wear mushed them together and only recently untangled them. Star rating changed.",
        "One of my favourite watch faces but... I'd like to be able to choose more options of what Info is shown and were and have an option of hiding the seconds and more options to keep parts of the fx on/off all the time as well as the random setting it has atm.",
        "Amazing Thank you very much for an awesome watch face.",
        "Beautiful Holy Brilliance and endless customization! Super slick and love the glitch effect. Major battery eater though... I'm sure it can be tinkered with in the web of settings somewhere, but this face drained my 360 by 55% in just a little over 2 hours.",
        "Awesome. But a few questions How do I enable burn in protection? It also appears that if I turn the ambient ring off, the transitions fail and get stuck. Is there anyway to dim the ambient? Edit.......... The developer emails back quickly and is helpful! Thanks!"

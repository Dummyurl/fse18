        "Fixed! Thank you!",
        "Bought this twice, first time after a while, got it reduced as it never showed up. Seconds time, was taking a risk, as I knew it couldn't be refunded, nope, still hasn't shown on my watch, but every free one has. Last time I buy one as it's a waste it seems.  Update: made sure I was on 2.0 as suggested...my fault! Works great! Certainly do that to all who have that problem! Thank y'all!",
        "Purchased, but when trying to install on a Zenwatch 2 on AW 2.0 I am requested to purchase and pay for it again. No idea of what is going on... Refunded.",
        "I love this watch face. I think there is lots of cool things that could be added to it over time. Looking forward to updates.",
        "Looks great, best of the bash watchfaces in my opinion. It's also quite energy efficient."

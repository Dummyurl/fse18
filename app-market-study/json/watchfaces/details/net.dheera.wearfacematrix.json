        "Excellent Looks excellent on my Sony Smartwatch 3. The time is NOT hard to read despite what other critics are saying. The only thing it lacks is configuration to display a date also but I like the fact there are no in-app purchases and that it doesn't require any permissions. Exactly how it should be and it does exactly what it says it does. Well done!",
        "Tried loads of watch faces but none compare to this one. It's just way cooler than every other one. My friends say the same. Shame as I'd like a change now and then but the face is a part of me now haha",
        "Restore original font I hate the new font. Next time don't introduce such a drastic change without giving users a way to choose which font they want. New version still hasn't fixed this.",
        "Nice! I really like this one. My only wish is that the app icon didn't occupy the app drawer on my phone since all of the options for watches these days can be handle directly through the Android Wear app. Great watch face Dev! 👍👍",
        "My daily watch face. Beautiful simplistic watch face. Font is spot on too. My only complaint (!) I would love to be able to slow down the falling text, might just be me it just looks a little too quick. If there was an option for fall speed adjustment that'd be great. But still one of the best out there. Asus zenwatch.",
        "BRING THE OLD ONE BACK The new design is horrible please bring back the old one! I'd be willing to pay to have option to change the clock font."

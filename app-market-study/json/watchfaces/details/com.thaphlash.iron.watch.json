        "Must Own So I don't buy many apps but I pretty much own all of this devs  watchfaces and by far this is my favorite.  Dev is always consistent and always packs on features after a watchface is put out.   If you own android wear you have to try these watchfaces as they are some of the best out there.  I hope we can maybe get some dc comics love in the future as I'd love to see what the dev could come out with for those watchfaces.",

        "Actually like it more than the Ranger (a paid watchface that I own by the same company). Only glitch in settings, a name change will not stay set, it simply goes back to \"classic\" which is o.k., but a tad on the generic side. Otherwise, very smooth looking, love it. Surprised they're giving it away!",
        "Everything is fine but the seconds hand doesn't work in ambient mode. It is visible but isn't moving and so I turned the seconds hand off on ambient mode. Please fix that to make the app perfectly awesome.",
        "Perfect This is simply one the most elegant watch faces for free in the world. One suggestion, if you let us also customize the lower text as well. Please üòä",

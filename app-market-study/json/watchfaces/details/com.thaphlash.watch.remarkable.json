        "Superb I continue to be amazed. This is my fifth watch face. They are all great and I will probably end up buying all of them. Sci-Fi, functionality and great design. Keep up the good work! -Note- the battery gauge for the phone on this one doesn't seem to update or stay accurate. I have also had this happen in the station watch face. Thanks!",
        "Awesome watch face but... This watch face is awesome and highly customizable but I did notice some lag while using this face. I do love the options that come with it and recommend it to anyone. If there was a way to make it a little lighter as far as functionality I would re-write this and give it 5 stars 10 times over.",
        "This watch face is great. Liking this watch face on my moto 360 2015 (marshmallow).  Is it possible to have the option of battery status on ambient mode ?  I'm thinking the text version rather than dial.  Easily 5 star from me after that.",
        "Great options Many ways to customize this face. No apparent battery drain. So far I am loving it",
        "My favorite Artist What can I say about this guy, well he makes art that speaks to me, I just recently discovered the PHLASH and this man is a true artist and make some of the most beautiful watchfaces out there and that's WORD.) I'm sure that the angels in heaven weep with every new release, so thanks for that man, my wrist has never looked better.)",
        "The Design is nice, the 1st watch face I bought. However I wish you can turn that digital clock into second time zone! That would be awesome!"

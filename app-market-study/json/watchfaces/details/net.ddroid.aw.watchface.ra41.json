        "Nice watch face. After install on phone I found it would only install on watch when it gets on the charger. It would be nice if the \"time to ambient\" had an option between default and ten seconds as the default 3-4 seconds is too short and 10 is too long.",
        "Great face. Great ambient mode. Super control panel with lots of options. Not a battery hog. Installed in a few seconds on my LG Urbane 2. Kudos to the developer!",
        "üòéüëç Great on Android Wear 2. You have to wait a couple minutes or so for download prompt on the watch after phone install. Works flawlessly. (swipe up to see prompt/progress) Also it's awesome being able to change the color of the LED background. This is definitely one of the best watch faces on the market. ü§î Although it would be great if we could have custom color for our ambient, not sure why it still has preset colours only. Maybe they could at least add orange",
        "Great Watch Face when you can get it to install I love this watchface.  I had to reset my gear 2.  I have installed and uninstalled the watchface multiple times and it never syncs to the app so I can use the watchface.",
        "My favorite watch face. Application works perfectly on LG G Watch R running Wear 2.0, you just need to install it on watch using Google Play from the watch itself not only on the phone. You can see the apps installed just on phone by scrolling down in Google Play App screen on watch or probably by searching it.",
        "Doesn't show as a watch face in Android Wear 2 after installation. LG G Watch R."

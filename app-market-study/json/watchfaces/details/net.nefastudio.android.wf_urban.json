        "Love it! I like busy looking stuff and this is busy. Battery life is ok too. But Think it would be nice to have some colour options. Like you know to pick a color for ambient mode or something.",
        "Great watch face of only........ Add step count to the design and make the calendar, step count and weather interactive then it would get 5 stars",
        "Great since update Thank you â˜º working great now and love the color in ambient.",
        "Good but... ... if only the text fit on the moto 360",
        "The most interesting one yet",
        "Almost perfect. Such a unique face that provides a ton of information at a glance. I've yet to test how this effects battery life on my LG G watch, but there are very cool scheduling options included in the face settings. I think a few areas could be cleaned up a bit, but overall, this is a fun and unique way of telling time on android wear. If you like the look, this is definitely worth a purchase. This is my new default face!"

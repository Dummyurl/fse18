        "Tried very hard to make this app work on the Huawei watch with AW2.0 . If you download the app on your phone it will not automatically transfer to the watch , you need to then go to the watch and download it again . When I got it on the watch , it kept flickering and eventually crashed. Beautiful watchface but has function issues."

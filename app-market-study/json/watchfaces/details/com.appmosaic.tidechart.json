        "Cool app.  I've had out less than an hour so we'll see if it affects battery life or has any other issues.  This really needs a widget though.  Too tedious to check quickly.  Gear 4 coming so now is the perfect time to get that widget happening!",
        "It's not accurate at all. I cross referenced with other sites and for example it said low tide on 01/16/18 was 1:40pm. But it really was 1:08 pm. I went in and selected beaches listed near here and none were close.",
        "Useless  apk ! Tide at the time does not indicate. You have to Guess actual tide from the tiny graph line.  Ask refund few hours after  purchase but they don't !",
        "I'd like to see times in 24 hour format. Otherwise a great little app and accurate for my needs",
        "How can I switch from 24hr time to 12hr time on the main watch face?",
        "Pretty good,  Love the android wear app,   requested Feature: Auto-detect the closest location based on the phone's location."

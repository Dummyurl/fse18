        "Not too shabby I was gonna issue a refund but....There aren't that many dialers and I've tried a few. This is probably gonna be the one. I understand not many use the pound key but I do please add that. And also give us the ability to select themes or colors. Then 5 stars",
        "Nearly perfect Beautifully presented app that is a joy to use. Certainly the best I've tried. Just needs phone to be forced to speaker mode when answering from the watch, then it would be perfect.",
        "Nice but missing option To enable the call to use watch for some android wear watched that have a speaker. Will give 5 stars when it does.",
        "Great app! This should be included as a basic part of Android Wear! Pictures for speed dial is a nice addition!",
        "?? When accepting calls is there a way to automatically have the phone turn on  speakerphone, as of now that does not work even when option checked to allow speakerphone",

Although the 28-day cycle is the same length as the average woman's menstrual cycle and was originally described as a \"female\" cycle (see below), the two are not necessarily in any particular synchronization.Each of these cycles varies between high and low extremes sinusoidally, with days where the cycle crosses the zero line described as \"critical days\" of greater risk or uncertainty.(refer from wikipedia, see more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythm)For Android 6.0(and higher) phone usersNeed to do following setup procedure after installation.http://androidwearface.com/for_android6_users/InstallationIt will be installed on your watch automatically from your phone paired with your watch after a short time and please wait.After installation,you can choose the watch face from the setting menu.Or just long tap on the current watch face screen,so watch face selector screen will open.More watch faces- Visit our exclusive watchface collection for Android Wear on the Play Store http://goo.gl/RITBygPlease note- If you don't like this model please cancel your order in 15 minutes.

        "My go to watch face love it",
        "Cool but needs more customization I like the biorhythm graph, but I need to more color options,  also I would love to have the current temperature at least.!!!",
        "Very interesting However please do add more details of the description of reading the biometers values ? Ex: what is F or B ?  Also a blacked out background would be better for screen burn and battery",
        "A Biorythm watch After some issues with syncing the watch face has finally showed up on the watch. I can recommend this app as far as I can make it there was no specific reason for the delay but all good now much thanks to the Dev. It's the only take on Biorhythm on the wear Platform and so far it's been very promising.",
        "It's okay .. but I don't understand why this is running a background tank even while I'm not even using the face."

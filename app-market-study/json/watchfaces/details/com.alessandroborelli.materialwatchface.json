        "Why can't I find this app on my LG watch urbane 1st Gen on Android Wear 2.0?   Update : ok no prob now, i was just stupid",
        "I really liked this on my LG G Watch. Too bad it's not compatible with the LG Watch  Style.",
        "I really like it, would be nice to be able to chance the top color part with something at your won choice and weather to be updated without phone needing to be paired. But otherwise it;s nice.",
        "Refuses to apply changes unless GPS is enabled",
        "Battery Indicator Is Pointless I love this watchface, but there is a bug with the weather when it comes out of ambient mode, the temperature jumps to billions of degrees. One thing I would love is if the battery could reflect my phone's battery and not my watch's battery, I don't care what my watch is at. That one change and I'll give 5 stars, thanks!",
        "I like the design, the simplicity and yet the amount of information it displays. But, I've seen a bug on multiple occasions where the ambient display is stuck with seconds, battery and date info displayed. It does resolve in time, but it is strange."

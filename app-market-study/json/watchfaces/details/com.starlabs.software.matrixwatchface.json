        "This is exactly what I'm looking for except for that the time doesn't update you have to touch your watch and go into your apps to update time very annoying. I'm using an LG urbane",
        "The time isn't correct The time doesn't stay on time cause the clock lags or something",
        "Almost there Not quite there yet.  Love the customization,  but date is a must for me.  Seems like an easy fix to me.  Also could offer a few more fonts",
        "Awesome but... Time doesn't update which wouldnt be an issue on like anything other than a watch..",
        "Needs better looking fonts! Everything else looks great!"

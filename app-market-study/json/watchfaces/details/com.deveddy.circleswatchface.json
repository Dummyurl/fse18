        "Great! This is a nice, well designed watch face with useful customisation options. But notification text overlays the rest of the watch face in a strange way. I would also love more customisation options such as changing colour schemes",
        "Burn in issue Looks nice but watch out for burn in on amoled screens. The ambient mode is prone to severe burn in. Keep it off !",
        "If I could change colors that would be great! The customization is great but it's still lacking. Color options should have been given at the start, as I personally believe that every watch face should have color customization.",
        "Very pretty! The watch face works perfect and looks fantastic on my LG Urbane! Would be nice to be able to customise the colours, I'd be willing to pay that as an extra feature hint hint!",
        "Great animation and enough customization. I like your watch face as much as watch face of Ben. Good job!",
        "Installed app but cannot find watch face anywhere. Using Moto 360 and Galaxy S7 carnt even find the app on my phone."

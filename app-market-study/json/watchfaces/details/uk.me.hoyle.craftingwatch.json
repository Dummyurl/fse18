        "Disappointed that it Doesn't Work on My Newest Smartphone Android\\Droid Turbo 2 by Motorola of Google. Yeah, I downloaded this app from the Google's Play/Apps store thinking this be nice to use while I'm Crafting for Skill-Up's on my FFXI game from the Leviathans Server but after installed on my Android Turbo 2 phone it Just simply will not open up\\doesn't have an open app feature but just shows an uninstall feature & Will not be functional on my smartphone's. Wonderful!!! I guess, sadly (-,-:; uninstalling..",
        "Thanks Tony for converting this into a watch face. :)  Works as it should and has managed to keep up the with the vanadiel time after the past couple of years.  For those who are complaining it doesn't work on their phones lemme remind you... it's round, it's watch-shaped, it says it's a watch face, therefore it goes on a watch.",
        "Awesome watch face Don't know why people are trying to use this solely on a phone when the title clearly says it's a watch face. It is, however, a good and simple reminder of the crafting strengths and weaknesses, and a great clock/lunar phase display. Not too stressful on the watch battery either.",
        "Wouldny install either on s5 neo Very disapointed as I thought also. Too bad",
        "Not working on samsung s5 and not enough faq to help solve the issue"

        "I don't think this app deserves 5 stars as it's right now, but I gave it 5 as the current rating (3.3 stars is too low as well).  I really love the stely of the watchface and has some really useful settings, although I'm messing someother features that can be found in other watchfaces, although I have contacted with the developers they have taken my feedback and probably add those features. So kudos to them from that! Edit: The battery usage of the watchfaces is considerably higher than other ones, take that also into consideration. The creators might update it to make it more efficient.",

        "Love the clean design. However, recently I am unable to pull up day of month. It only shows name of month, with the day of month so small you can't read it. Please bring back the option to have just the day of month -- as shown in your Google Play description examples.",
        "Well designed The atmo faces look nice and are well designed.  Support for card previews in ambient mode would be nice.",
        "Good, graphical issue The center square covers the atmos logo. Other than that, great face!",
        "Something that makes my watch looks like a watch",
        "5 sstars if the logo is not covered The atom logo is covered, plz fix it."

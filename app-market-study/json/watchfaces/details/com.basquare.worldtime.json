        "After wasting at least $8 or more, I have finally found a reasonable watch face for my travelling needs! It is odd that there are very few watch faces that do the job of tracking at least three time zones credibly!  This one does it efficiently. However, it needs to improve. In particular, weather updates and/or calendar updates should be there.",
        "Looks ok but I don't like that it only takes up like half the screen.  Also couldn't find how to adjust the settings to put different time zones on the right. So frustrating I uninstalled it.",
        "Thanks for 12 hrs format Please add wallpapers for that black screen",
        "Doesn't even appear after install.  Something fishy about that?",
        "Must have face for Android wear!",
        "Unique, simple to use, most useful."

Because the watch face uses public geotagged photos from Flickr, it will constantly update over time and present interesting photos based on Flickr's interestingness algorithm. And, since the watch face gets new photos automatically as you go to new places, it is perfect to wear when travelling! It also looks great on both round and square screens.Please email us if you have issues, ideas, or any feedback in general.",

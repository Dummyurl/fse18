        "Within a few minutes of downloading, I bought the app. The difference it's made in the sound of my wireless earbuds is incredible, I'll update my review if the battery drain is bad which is what I'm expecting. Edit; the volume amplifier stops working everytime the next song plays which is quite annoying, only fix I've found is to adjust one of the knobs to reactivate it Edit 2; experimental fix solves this but with a 1 second delay before the volume amplifier kicks in",
        "This app is helpful due to hard of hearing it made an an audiobook that sounded muffled into a more listenable audiobook wish this had the ability to reckon hearing loss programming it would be a lot helpful and more accurately enhance otherwise it's a solid app all around",
        "Great equalizer but at the start of every song there is a blast of music at maximum volume for about half a second. This has made the app unusable.",
        "I bought this app and it doesn't recognise any artist in my google play music. All the songs on my device are bought",
        "Did not expect it to work as well as it did, five stars.",
        "Best equalizer ever I used.Thank you guys."

        "It installed very easily and looks awesome. It is hard on battery life and very sluggish. I have a ZenWatch 3. If this was fixed I'd give this 5 stars and maybe buy it. I'm not sure what is wrong because other very detailed faces work great!",
        "Excellent! Face has a good resolution! Crisp!  But the lock which appears on right top doesn't work! I tap on it and the symbol turns to \"locked\" but still I m able to access ! Screen doesn't get locked!  Please let me know what that lock is for! And finally please find battery consumption! It gets drained rapidly",
        "The faces themselves are great. But the uncontrollable promotion of other faces I should be buying as notifications periodically makes me want nothing to do with this product.",
        "Love the look of the face, but had a hard time getting installed on my watch an still cannot get the step counter to work....to see my step I need to change to a different face watch....so I know it's the face or the user that has an issue.",
        "While I really like the design I never realized how horrible it is on the watch battery. Some days I can only get 10 hours out of my new watch that is estimated to last 3 days.",
        "Installed it for my wear24. Watch face didnt show up initially. But got fixed later after installing thru App on watch"

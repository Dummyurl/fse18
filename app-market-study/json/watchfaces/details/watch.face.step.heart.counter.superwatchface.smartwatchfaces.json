        "This is a decent face but I have a couple of issues. (1) The step counter is not linked to Google Fit, so the step information is not in sync. Seems like this would be the best way to show step information instead of trying to calculate it yourself. (2) The settings say the Heart Rate Sensor is not detected. I have an LG G Watch R and this is one of the main reasons I purchased the watch face.",
        "my huawei watch keeps saying \"no heart sensor\" how can that be? i have a sensor! i bought this face for the active continuous heart rate.. and it doesn't work! please tell me how to fix this",
        "No pulse monitor My Moto 360 second generation says there is no heart monitor. I hope this will be rectified soon otherwise I will seek a refund.",
        "Latest version on my LG Watch Urbane says there is No Heart Sensor - LG app for measuring heartbeat works fine.",

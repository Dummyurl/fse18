        "I like it, but have had to stop using it as it is causing burn in on my g watch r. This is because of the date having a white background in ambient mode, and is big enough so that even when moving the watchface (part of the g watch r's burn in protection) it still causes burn in. It would be nice if there was an option to invert the date (white text on black background) then I could go back to using it. ðŸ˜‰",
        "I like this watchface, clean and provide usefull info on watch. However some minor bugs, date number not centerd, is too far left off the circle. Also brightness in dim/ambient mode is too high. Maybe it's better to add option to add brightness controll for wake and ambient mode.",
        "Very good I downloaded several watch faces which I ended up refunding or uninstalling as they weren't as good as pictured - this one I kept and looks great on my AsusZen only wish the seconds indicator could be changed to another function like steps...",
        "Almost there! Developer's done a lot to fix early bugs, but the off-center date digits still persist on watches like the Moto 360 v2, and Huawei Watch. They're too far to the left of their circle background. Animations and legibility are topnotch.",
        "nice but not fully Functional Weather does not sync with local weather. Stuck at 32f.  For something that i paid money for it. It should have been tested and debugged.",
        "Very nice watch face.  Only issue is, it is not picking up my battery level from my phone (Moto 360 watch and Samsung S5 phone)."

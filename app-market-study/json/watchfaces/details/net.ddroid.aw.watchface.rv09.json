        "Looks really great! And works well too! Doesn't drain the battery quickly and gives you a ton of info.  Every once in a blue moon the screen would shift in a strange way during always on mode but it was rare enough to not be a substantial bother. I'm sure it'll get patched out soon enough.",
        "The best watch face ever.",
        "Beautiful LG G watch R",
        "Looks great on the LG G Watch R.  Love the features and ability to select the choice of colors for the individual features. Don't know where it is getting its weather info. I'm using the 1Weather app but it doesn't read the same info.  Needs a little work on battery drainage. Fix those and it it would be perfect. Otherwise, GREAT APP!!!",
        "Pretty good looking watch face! But so you know the seconds doesn't show in ambient mode or better said when in black and white mode on LG G Watch R but still this one is pretty good watch face!"

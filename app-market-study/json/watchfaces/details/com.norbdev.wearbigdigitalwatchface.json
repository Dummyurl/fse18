        "Still no customability options yet, but the simple design feels like it fills up more space on my LG G Watch than most other watch faces I've got, leaving my screen look a little less empty while displaying the time in an easy-to-read, neat-looking style.",
        "Excellent Like it a lot, will be better once you upload the colours but makes my watch feel new and different."

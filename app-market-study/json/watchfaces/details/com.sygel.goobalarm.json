You do not need to logon to that network, only the signal strength is used!4) Wifi will be turned on just before the alarm sounds (if it was switched off).  This is why the app needs the “CHANGE WI-FI STATE” permission.5) The app will add an Alarm icon to the home screen if the alarm is set.

        "Good, but you should really try the pro version",
        "Nice",
        "Did what I needed It definitely did what I needed it to do but when I didn't have an alternate dismissal already selected and I had accidentally set my Wi-Fi signal strength needed too high there was no alternate shut off...I had to do an emergency uninstall just to get it to shut off. I now know this so I reinstalled it but when it's 5 a.m. it's a hard lesson to learn.",
        "Best alarm clock My favourite feature is the alarm that can only be turned off via a strong wifi signal. It literally forces me to get out of bed."

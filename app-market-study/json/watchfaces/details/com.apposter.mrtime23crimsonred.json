        "Good but not great I like the red look but the ambient mode is boring and basically useless.",
        "Very good. Watch face ideal for circular Android Wear watches. Quite elegant. The red is nice because the watch doesn't come with any predominantly red faces pre-installed.",
        "Not found by Samsung gear. How do I use this?",
        "It won't work on my watch I tried installing it twice and now can't get a refund ðŸ˜¡",

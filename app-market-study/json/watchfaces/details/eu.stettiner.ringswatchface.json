        "Very good but. It's a very good looking watch face. One of the best I have seen.  I love how it looks and all the colors it comes with to choose from.  The sad part it appears to drains the battery very quickly. I used to be able to charge my 360 every other day, since install been having to charge everyday. Hopefully this gets corrected cus its truly is a nice looking watch face."

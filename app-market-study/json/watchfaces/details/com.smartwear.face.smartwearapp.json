        "Best wear app This app is what makes having a smart watch fun. Notifications are nice but being able to change faces at will is the best feature. Love the collection feature! I like to change watch bands frequently and being able to put watch faces into collections to match my watch bands and having them load automatically is awesome! Keep up the great work.",

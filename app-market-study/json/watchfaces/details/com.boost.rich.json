        "Almost perfect i very much enjoy this watchface. Looks cool on my asus zenwatch 2.Never had one so detailed before. The more disapointing to find out that The lines and details in ambient mode are pixelated and partly undefined and even invisible. Really hope you will fix that in future but hey thanks anyway for The good job allready. Greetz Cliff",
        "DB47 The developer is awesome. I had an issue loading watchface and they worked with to the tune of eight emails or so until they fixed my problem! Bravo. Customer service is still alive and well!",
        "Good I like this so far but don't understand why there is a minute and seconds hand section when we have the digital time. It would be nice if there was an option to have just the hour above the date instead of the digital time.  Also needs more customization and colors"

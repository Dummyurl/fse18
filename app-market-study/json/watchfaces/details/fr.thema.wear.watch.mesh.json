        "Needs more interactivity, restricted to a single \"bottom\" center widget when i have been using Master by the same dev. I like the look of this but not the functionality. I like having heart rate, weather and step counter all on the watch face at the same time. this one Makes you choose just one (and not easily mind you) at a time.",
        "Can't change the background. Can't disable the analog indicators and marks. Other than those few things, it's great!",
        "Great developer. This face is really nice and simple for when you need to see the time often and quick. The big text makes it easy and fast to read.",
        "Nice and customisable Simple but useful. You can make a Sci fi like watchface or just a simple one.",
        "Sleek. Simple and sharp. I like it.",
        "Nice looking and practical This is a good looking watch face. Very happy with the purchase. Batteries, weather and clock presented together nicely. A new favourite."

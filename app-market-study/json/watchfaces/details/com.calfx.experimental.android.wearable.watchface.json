    "description": "This watch face application currently has seven watch faces and it will be updated in the near future to have a total of 10 watch faces.  It is called \"Experimental\" because during the development of a watch face I experiment with backgrounds, colors and shapes to make that watch face visually appealing, readable in full daylight, or even unique.  I personally use various colors of the watch's hands to indicate a mood of the day; for example, if I know I will need to do something important, I will set the watch's hands to red.  If the day is supposed to be easy, I will set them to green/blue.It may take few minutes for the new watch face to appear. You may want to try tapping \"Resync Apps\" in the Android Wear App on your phone. If, after doing this, you still don't see the new watch face in your Android Wear app, you can also try rebooting your phone and watch.",

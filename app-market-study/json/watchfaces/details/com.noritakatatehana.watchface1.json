        "Pretty good My only gripe is that sometimes the second hand doesn't disappear on my LG G Watch when the screen goes into power saving mode.",
        "Nice idea I like the idea.. it's just not clear enough though.. very pixelated",
        "Unclear The idea isn't bad, but the implementation isn't great. To difficult to read.",
        "Almost perfect Liked the design from the beginning but I think it would be great to see the battery level while it charges.",
        "Would love higher resolution. The image is too grainy to make the effect believable.",
        "Looks cool on square face.1 of my faves :)"

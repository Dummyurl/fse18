        "Please add the option to change the font on the At a glance widget. The reason why I chose to use Chronus's one instead of the built in into the launcher is because it was sticking to good old Roboto instead of the atrocity that Product Sans is.",
        "I paid for pro a long time ago and now  when i go to change something and it says I need pro. It wants to charge me again.",
        "Please add an option for the forecast to show the upcoming forecast and not current conditions when sized down",
        "Must have. Great all around widget",
        "I got this app for the widget, so it suits my purposes. I like the weather widget and the moon cycles. However, the weather is honestly super unreliable. Usually it is about 10° off from the local weather station (which is generally accurate). Today the app said it was 73° outside when it was actually 50°. I don't recommend you rely on this app for weather.",

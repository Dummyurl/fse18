        "Nice look but needs more widget options such as step count and weather. Not really a big fan of dial widgets either. Prefer number displays. Also battery status and another time zone widgets are not what I want to see displaying. More options please. Complications for Wear 2.0 would be great.",
        "I have the same problem with the upgrade to pro. I did what you recommend for the other guys but still didn't work",
        "Like the design so much, but need more settings (i.e for adjusting the brightness at dim/ambient mode would be great)",
        "Looks nice but.... How bout making a weather widget as well?",
        "Like it Please add some color option for dial background.",

        "Pleasantly surprised, but needs more. There needs to be a way to turn off the \"pop\" feature. Every time my watch face gets tapped, the color scheme changes. There needs to be an option to lock it. Also there needs to be a battery level complication. And lastly, and least importantly, I would like to see more color options or even the ability to choose the colors.",
        "I bought this face for my ZenWatch 2 with the intention of playing with it for a while and then getting a refund, but after seeing it on my watch I definitely will be keeping and using this watch face!"

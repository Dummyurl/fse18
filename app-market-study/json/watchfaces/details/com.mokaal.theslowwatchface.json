So when glancing, you get a ballpark of the current time.Since you may want to know the time faster, there is an elegant word clock option (enabled by default) which tells you the time in 5 minute increments. But if you are a purist you can disable it in the options.Take it slow and enjoy!You can now add a Slow Widget on your Android phone and enjoy the Slow Watch Face even without an Android Wear device!NEW: Updated for Android Wear 2.0 and added date and background color option!",

        "Slow watch face:  Experience update- Mikael has generously initiated refund for me.  Please be sure that you understand all of the accessory equipment you will need to install and run this app.  All the best to you and to the developer!  JN No functionality.  Drawings of hypothetical graphics for a 24 hour dial.  I want a refund.",
        "It's good, but not great. Honestly, not enough customization to deserve a price tag. Especially since there are more customizable apps for free. If you really want a slow watch face, sure. If not, give it a pass.",
        "Combines my two favourite kinds of watch face. With a 24-hour analogue-style dial and a fuzzy text clock, this is probably one of my favourite watch faces. I'd love a few more features, like background colour options, date display, or even extra notches on the dial for sunrise and sunset times, but as it is, it is nice to use. It even has a pleasantly start ambient mode that differs little from its regular display.",
        "It's not bad for a 'slow' watch face. Needs a clearer hour hand and colour options. Good",
        "It's nothing like the preview!",
        "Its awesome Really loved that!"

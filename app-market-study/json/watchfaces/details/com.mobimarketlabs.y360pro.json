        "The free version was gorgeous and by far more stable than the Pro. The pro crashes immediately every time it starts for me. Support has responded promptly mentioning they're in the process of updating the watchface to resolve some backwards compatibility issues. Once they've fixed it I'll update this review but up until then I can give it no more than 2 stars as it simply doesn't work.",
        "The free version worked fine - the pro version never worked - only crashed over and over.  Follow instructions to clear cache, etc., but this never did work!  Also - tried the Pathfinder watch face by this vendor and paid for it - it never was available for me to select as a watch face?  These watch faces (paid versions anyway) don't seem to work.    I went so far as to wipe my phone to factory settings and installed just android wear and this Y360 Pro watch face.  Still crashed on the lg g watch r paired with my lg v10 phone - EVERY TIME!  Not worth the money in my opinion.",
        "Doesn't work on my phone and watch. Did the un install reseting cache and data. Always crush and stop working",
        "Why did I pay for this?",
        "I never could get it to work on my Huawei Watch 2 Classic with Android Wear 2.0.  I reverted to their Interactive version which worked just fine."

        "Mediocre. Worst part is the ambient mode... it doesn't look nice there. Removed it as soon ad I saw that",
        "Moto 360 2nd gen Watch looks really nice on this watch. It just might become my daily watchface. I just installed it time will tell (pun intended). 1 drawback that i found is that new changes to the watchface dont happen quickly. I made changes to it 5 mins ago stil havent been applied to the watch. Not a reason for me to take a star away. For now.",

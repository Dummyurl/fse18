        "I love this watch face but for some reason the steps aren't working? Its just 0 on all 3 areas. I bought the premium edition. I am hoping to get this feature working so I can keep it as my primary face on my android wear watch.  3 stars for now and 5 if I can get the steps working.",
        "All the functions related to the GPS not working.. Steps, walking, distance and others. I paid just to have the full function.. How can Get them all???  And i connect to google fit, still distance not working... The steps worked",
        "Watch face won't sign into Google fit so can't see Google fit data. Bit frustrating really. I've signed into the companion app but the watch says not signed in. Tried but unfortunately won't log into Google fit on watch.",
        "The data isn't accurate from Google fit. Nice watch face other than that but pointless if the data doesn't match the watch face. This needs sorting ASAP",
        "Bought premium and steps don't update.  This is ridiculous and needs to be fixed.  Signed into Google for on the app and the watch.  Reinstalled both the app and watch.  The data is in Google fit but not updating to the watch at all.",
        "It looks that i have paid only for the watch skin not for the functions which the developers have advertised. The step count doesnt work. It opens the music app for no reason. I have seen into the comments that this is a known issue which the developers are reluctant to fix."

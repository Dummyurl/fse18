        "I really like the design of this face, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because although it lets you customize it, your settings can not be saved. Additionally I wish there was an option to lock the screen to one color scheme instead of having to cycle through all the presets to get back to the one you want every time you happen to touch the screen.",

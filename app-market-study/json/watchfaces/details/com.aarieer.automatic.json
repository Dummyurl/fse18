        "Boring, not able to customize The included Moto 360 watch face are more attractive, this should be free. There're better free watch face to download, I wasted my money.",
        "Do not like the ambient mode Looks good until it is in ambient mode",
        "Elegant and simple Using an LG Urbane and this is only one of two watch faces out of dozens I've tried that is in my regular rotation of use. It's not flashy, interactive etc, but that is fine for me. I want a watch face to tell time and to show off the piece and this face does it. Lots of compliments received and loving the fact it's rocking a Swiss logo, dying for a victorinox esquire watch face and this comes close. Thanks Dev!",

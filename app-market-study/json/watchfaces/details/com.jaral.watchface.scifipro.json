        "Had the standard one for a while and liked it,so I upgraded. But a bit disappointed with the customising options, would like to change the colour on the hour and min mark's. Also be able to brighten them, and maybe change the shapes and colours. But still happy with the purchase.",
        "Hands need to be brighter and a watch battery sub dial would be a killer add in imo Would like to see more user options more colors to play with etc also i cannot change my weather color it goes to the color wheel i pick but it still stays white must be a bug?",

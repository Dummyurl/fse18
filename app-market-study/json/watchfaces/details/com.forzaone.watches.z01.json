        "Military Time... Needs it bad. Could it be taken directly from the phone? That is what I have my phone setup for. We could switch the main window to the smaller one with the Military time and back and forth. 5 stars if we can figure that one out.                                    9-6-16. Newest update got lots of deep settings for real customizing including Military time! Five stars!",

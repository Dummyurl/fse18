        "The layout is very nice, however unless you have an amoled screen this will eat your battery alive in a very short amount of time.  I had to uninstall it from my moto 360 to stop my battery from draining at a phenomenal rate.",
        "Such a shame I was so excited to install this watch face on my smartwatch 3 because of how clean and elegant it looked but I got the shock of my life when the battery drained from 70% to 3% in 1 hour! ðŸ˜°. Please fix the battery drain issue. It's colossal.",
        "WARNING. do not install. This face stopped my watch from charging. it drained to nothing and would not charge. took 3 days to get 2% battery into the watch. quickly changed face and it charged fine. this face almost made my moto 360 useless. DO NOT INSTALL........",
        "Charging issues When I'm using this watch face my moto 360 won't charge properly. It stucks at 60% or somewhere around that amount. Please fix it. It really looks good.",
        "Almost Put in a Square Trade Service Ticket Apparently this app is the culprit of draining of draining my battery to almost in operable condition. On top of that it keeps coming up with this annoying notification to sync.  A shame I have to uninstall because it is by far one of the best design I come across .it looks way better in person than it does looking at a picture",
        "Nice layout Only thing I didn't like was the fixed Fahrenheit display & locked up customisation option. I always end up doing the opposite to purchasing in such cases."

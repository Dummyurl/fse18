        "Since latest Android wear update I have to synch both the phone app and the watch app constantly for Google fit and weather to work properly. The watch app takes over the phone app on default goals, weather a d other settings so what's the point of having the phone app then?",
        "Yeah, didn't realize the free version looked so different than the premium version. Not interested in paying for it, if I cannot test it. The free version looks cheep, and not at all what I want. Sorry, no go.",
        "Useless weather,  after synchronized, still show 0C on the wear. Cannot change weather provider, it is required Purchase.",
        "It's good but I have to keep disconnecting and reconnecting google fit to reset my steps counter. It keeps freezing.",
        "My favourite watch face of all time but unfortunately cannot use it anymore as after the last android wear update there has been devastating sudden battery drain issues, please optimise this excellent watch face so people can use it and I'll be your best friend ;-)",
        "Try reinstalling it still says free."

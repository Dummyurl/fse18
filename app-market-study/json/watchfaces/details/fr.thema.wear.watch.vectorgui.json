        "I currently own 3 Thema watch faces. Where do I even begin? The design and animation alone, is beyond impressive (in my opinion). I typically don't like to pay for watch faces, but if my contribution allows for future thema faces to be created, I will certainly be coming back for more.",
        "please keep update it , I love it!",
        "--Pre Android Wear 2-- The watch face design is excellent & movement can be set to fast, slow or no movement. The inactive mode also works nicely to save power with colour & non colour mode that looks crap. The watch face does have some issues where shortcuts crash the watch face & colour selection from the watch face does not work with all colours but does work from the app & has more colours. I hope they keep working on the watch face as it has potential with its configurable design making it good value for money.  --Post Android Wear 2-- Don't use this watch face from Android  Wear 2. This watch face crashed the watch so badly that it could not be closed or restarted after it froze on a blank screen when I tried to change color from the LG Urbane.",
        "Absolutely stunning, perfect if you love tech or sci-fi.",
        "Nice but can you get rid of those glowing cotton ball things and maybe allow a secondary color change option. Also maybe apply a glow around the time and vector",
        "It needs the option to turn off the cotton balls."

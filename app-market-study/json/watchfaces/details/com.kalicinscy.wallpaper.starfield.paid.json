        "Great! Been using the original since my first smartphone a few years ago.  One of my all time favs, had to buy the new one.  Loving it!  Great upgrade to the original, without adding fluff.  Best live wallpaper ever!!   Edit:  Holy crap, now it's on my watch too???  Looks great!  Only suggestion is green text for time (better for amoled screens)",
        "?? Maybe... ?!?!? We will See.!?? I'm sorry., Dev, I've tried each app, the original fee one..  And now this one.! I am not seeing what is supposed to be so great here.??! I find both apps very plain and boring, with no options, colors, or anything else.! But just my opinion and taste.! We all have our own likes and dislikes, that is why we are our own person and why we leave comments.!  (; Happy \"Near\" New Year to Everyone and I wish you all the best with your apps Dev, no matter my opinion.!! (: ðŸ’–",
        "Disappointed - I regret this purchase. On my Note 5, I get a 1\" square flashing in the upper left corner of my screen when Colored Stars is turned on. Also, the screensaver is a displayed option but won't work at all on my phone. I was REALLY looking forward to that since I really enjoy gazing at an endless starfield when listening to meditation tracks, books or just trying to ignore people. If these gliches are corrected, I will promptly update my review since a quality product deserves to be praised accordingly.",
        "Great wallpaper...however... Why take away the reverse function in the paid version?  And, would be great to add a control for viewing angle...to change direction of stars...because I dont use multiple home screen views but love the angle view.  Just a suggestion.  But reverse was too cool to remove - hoping you add it back.",
        "5 stars if it let's me choose custom image for background.  The images available are not that great to down right annoying.",
        "Solid star field Wish I could shorten the trails up a bit; they aren't tied to speed, so at slower speeds they're too long.  Other than that, this is great."

        "I had a problem with the reindeer animation and sent an email describing the problem to development and got an answer with detailed instructions on how to solve the problem within a few hours. I was very impressed with the prompt and detailed response. The watch face is also very cool.  I have a few other Husky watch faces and enjoy and use them all.",
        "Seeing as how I won't be using this app after Christmas, it should be free till Christmas, then locked. Or maybe if you have other premium husky faces it should be free. At least users would see what they're missing and purchase other premium faces. Just a thought.",
        "HELLO..  My husband put this cute app on his watch today.. I did the same and also I paid for Premium .. so where is my sleigh/reindeer with the countdown...??? I will put a rating when they appear :-(",
        "None off countdowns or merry Christmas animations ever appeared.",
        "This is a great app. It has a wide array of features, and it works. I would just wish that the active screen was on longer in order to see the animations in action.",
        "I have no sleigh, other than that it's fine"

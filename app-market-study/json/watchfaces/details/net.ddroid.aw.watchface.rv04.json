        "No real use to P-OLED screens in ambient mode I only did this to be seen I would give it 5 stars but since it still displays the full watch face in ambient mode on my (LG G Watch R)  it wears down my watch pixels which would cause a burn in on my screen not liking that. If theres a update to reduce information on the screen for P-OLED screen that would be great",
        "My favorite This is my absolute favorite watch face! It looks great on my Hauwei watch. Absolutely beautiful!",
        "Brilliant, detailed and non-standard I don't know how you got the flat look but it looks brilliant on my lg g watch r. This is one of my favourite/default faces. You're a great face designer... I've purchased about half of your designs... Keep 'em coming but please fix the weather - add more providers - it is still reporting incorrectly! Could it be a timezone issue? Please look into this... I sent you enough detail via email. Can't believe the lack of reply or consideration on this topic.",
        "Back to normal Developer fixed crash bug quickly. Even the weather is accurate now! Only missing an ambient mode.",
        "Fatally flawed This is a great watch face, but they only did half the job: there is no ambient mode face at all. Designed for AMOLED watches, this makes the face all but useless. If the power drain doesn't get you, burn-in will eventually. That's why every other watch face on the market has a low power, B&W (mostly black) ambient mode, not just a brightness adjustment for the full color face. Very disappointing, considering how nice a design it is. Also, it writes G Watch R on the face; should be huawei."

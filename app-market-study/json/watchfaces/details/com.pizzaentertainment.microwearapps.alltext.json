        "I liked it but getting pop up ads to \"like\" Pizza Entertainment's facebook page on my phone after *paying* is completely unacceptable. Uninstalling and won't buy again from this vendor.  Do NOT use intrusive advertising with paying customers.",
        "Ads galore After paying for the app you still have the pleasure of being pestered with ads. How nice.",
        "I like it the watch face. Would be nice if I could change from Celsius to Fahrenheit .",
        "This is a great watch face I use with my smart watch 3",
        "Cool minimalistic look. Works on my new Huawei.  Awesome.",
        "Does anyone make a good looking TIMER that is not cluttered with a lot of other distracting objects? The clarity of this design is simply beautiful! Draws your attention to the main focus - the time. Since those of us who do public speaking really don't want to be so conspicuous about time by lugging around a big timer or our smartphone, an app for a smartwatch would be perfect. An app that clearly displayed a TIMER (countdown and/stopwatch) INSTEAD of the time - like this watch face would be a dream come true . Ideally it would be nice to be able to toggle between displaying the TIME or a TIMER. And instead of the small weather cloud, perhaps some other symbol like a small digital stopwatch readout (when a countdown timer is being displayed). Many of us would be willing to purchase such an app but can not find ANYONE who makes one as  attractive as your All Text HD Watch Face. Please help!"

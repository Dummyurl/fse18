        "Seems like a good idea, but after I bought it, it disappeared. It's not in my Android Wear or my phone desktop but it IS in my app list. I tried rebooting the phone (LG G5 connected to an LG Urbane watch) but still no luck. Help!  Update - figured it out. You to click on 'Installed' to get it going.",
        "Lovely, aesthetic watch face. It's a tiny planisphere, although to be really useful you'd need a watch the size of a dinner plate. Instead of seconds I would like to see the rim have daylight / twilight / dark displayed, and the sun and moon's positions marked using either true solar time or local mean time. That would make it a practical astronomy tool to boot.",
        "Absolutely perfect. This has quickly become my favorite watch face, it never fails to get a good reaction from people. Attractive, functional, and simple while giving you really interesting information about the sky above you. I love this watch face, and the only improvement I would suggest is to add the ISS.",
        "I love this watchface. I also own ISSDetector. RunaR makes great software",
        "I love it, however recently re-paired and can't get to pop up anymore :( Would like a fix :)",

        "I'm amaze how quickly developer fixed Android 2.0 issue after I report the bug error message. Definately worth to spend money with this app.",
        "If you can't get the app to sync with your watch leave it a day or so. Worked for me after I reset my watch back to factory. Happy days! Thanks guys!",
        "Just would not show on watch even after 're boot 're install and left it for 24 hours to see if it would sync... it did not. Watch is LG Urbane and phone is s7 ☹  After a response from the dev I tried again to install.. SUCCESS!!! Thank you so much.",
        "Battery optimization beats all other similar watch faces by 30-50%! Would love to see the option to add a third complication for a second time zone.",
        "Watch face will not sync LG G. Even after factory reset several times",
        "I would rate 5/5 but it longer works on my 1st Gen Moto 360  Edit: Dev helped me fix my issue very pleased with this app"

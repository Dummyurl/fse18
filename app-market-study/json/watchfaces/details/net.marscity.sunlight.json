        "Absolutely love Krona Sunlight! Weather is the thing I check most on my watch so I keep coming back to this one. It's a great example of how to pack a huge amount of data on a tiny screen while keeping it functional AND elegant! Definitely worth whatever initial price, and the additional data subscriptions are very reasonable.",
        "Brilliant. Never thought I'd use \"just\" a weather face for my main watch face, but this adds so much at-a-glance info, without being ugly or digits heavy. Especially ingenious to estimate accurate forecasts even when disconnected. And I've never seen such a well-connected app, that I can always rely on it being up to date. Anxious to see where the app and dev go from here.",
        "This is exactly the kind of face I bought my watch to use. Visualizing a 24 hour weather forecast as a graph wrapped around the screen is brilliant. At a glance I can see projected conditions for any hour of the day, as well as watch and phone battery levels. Battery usage seems lighter than other watch faces I've tried as well, but I could just be imagining that.",
        "I'm redoing my review after updating to the latest version. Now, it's worthy of five stars. One gripe I had before was the short on-time, now with the slider I can make it whatever I want. Lots of information on the screen now, and I really like the new interactive modes. Great job!!",
        "At first I did not like the new subscription system. But after this update the watchface received the best design and functionality. Previously version was also the best among all. But now has become even better. The only thing I do not like it limit the number of updates the weather data. Thanks for your work.",
        "Not your regular weather watchface, takes a little getting used to but definitely worth it. Looks great to!  Will turn subscription back on when the other providers are (finally) added again. DarkSky not accurate for Europe."

        "I'll say only one more word AWESOME",
        "It doesn't work with custom images. When I select my own image and set it on my watch, my watch will blink for a few seconds, then switch to a blank watch face called \"Simple\". I can use Willow's stock backgrounds, but I cannot use my own. What's the point of allowing custom images then?",
        "Great photos for watch face. You can add your own, customize to some degree how the time, etc. appears, and cool fonts available. #realhip"

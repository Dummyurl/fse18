    "description": "A new analysis of burned antelope bones from caves in Swartkrans, South Africa, confirms that Australopithecus robustus and Homo erectus built campfires roughly 1.5 million years ago. Nearby evidence within Wonderwerk Cave, at the edge of the Kalahari Desert, has been called the oldest controlled fire. Microscopic analysis of plant ash and charred bone fragments suggests that materials in the cave were not heated above about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit (700 degrees Celsius). This is consistent with preliminary findings that grasses, brushes and leaves were burned for these fires — such fuel would not have been capable of hotter flames. The data suggests humans were cooking their prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of Homo erectus 1.9 million years ago. (Source: Wikipedia)This Watchface is the latest step in this long history of mankind and fire. Now you can carry a fire directly on your wrist of your hand.This Watchface has been created by software developers, who love to go camping on the weekends.Power Usage: Due to the fact that this is an animated watch face, the update rate of the watch face is higher than usually when the whats is in interactive mode. However our tests have shown, that the power usage of this watch face is not significantly higher than on other watch faces. In fact, we did not see any difference.Supported Devices:• Motorola Moto360• LG G WATCH R • LG G Watch• Samsung Gear LIVE • SmartWatch 3 • ASUS ZenWatch (optimized for Low-Bit Ambient Mode)• Sony 3 Android Wear• LG Watch Urbane• ... and any other smartwatches with Android Wear We support round and squared Android Wear watches.",

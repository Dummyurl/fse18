    "description": "Interstellar is another take by Red Bred Inc to design unique content for Android Wear watches running OS 5.0+ with phones running Android 4.4+.This watch face is based on geometric design. The watch face does not display data like number of steps or heart rate, it is an aesthetic watch face and is meant to tell time and stand from other watch faces.The different parts of the watch face tell different pieces of the current time: - The centre contains single minutes (1, 2, 3, 4 circles = 1, 2, 3, 4 minutes)- The first ring indicates the hour (3 circles filled in with a colour = 3 o'clock)- The second ring indicates the minute in increments of 5 (4 circles filled in with the minute colour = 20 minutes)- The outermost part of the crop circle is the second or orbitor, one full rotation = one minuteThe watch may be a little tricky to get used to at first, but definitely stands out among other watch faces.The watch face is fully customizable in terms of colours and runs on both square and circular watches (the appearance does not change and stays circular on square shaped watches).",

        "Would be better without a flat tire As far as abstract watch faces go, this is well readable and has a good array of color settings. Unfortunately, on the Moto 360 this face isn't so great; it really emphasises the flat tire which cuts into the 30 minute circle. Without the flat tire, this would be much nicer.",
        "Another great watch for my 360 Absolutely love it. Keep it up! Make more.",

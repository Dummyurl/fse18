        "I've made better on watchmaker.. I want to test the battery drain of Watchmaker and this is very like one i made. That's the only reason I paid for this. It should be free. Far far better are. It would be better to have all hours marked, The date has no window. There should be a choice of turning the seconds off. It's a drain. There's no dynamic shadows, to give a feel of depth to the hands. This is so basic 5mins to code in LA and 30 tops to do the rest. I made it to see.",
        "Finally got it to stick on watch and phone Keeps disappearing from Watch and Phone. Magically started to work. Seems like it would be more logical for this to have a 12 hour clock that follows the tick marks for the regular time as well as UTC, at least as an option.",
        "On my G watch, the settings only allow me to change colors.  There is no setting available to change the secondary time zone.",

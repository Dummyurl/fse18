        "[No longer updated.] Well-designed customizations and battery-efficient. Wrong time. [Update: Abandonware. Replaced by \"Magic Watch Face.\"] I love the design aesthetics of this watchface. And it has just enough customizations to make it feel personalized. Importantly, on my Gear Live, battery life is exemplary with this watchface. Unfortunately, the transition animation between active and ambient screens doesn't always finish, so about 20% of the time, the ambient screen displays the wrong time. So as a watch, this watchface fails.",
        "Great Foundation With Potential I think the DEV team hit a home run with the base app. My guess is that more great features and functionality will be introduced on top of the existing base.",
        "Well done Awesome watchfaces. Clean and neat. Pity there is no month function dial. Also would be great to allow the function dials to be made resizable. Also drop the full stop in the day of week function. Then it will be great.",
        "Misleading I got to be honest I thought that the faces on the front advert come with the price. They do not and I was gutted.",
        "Best face I've found so far All watch faces should work like this. Love the ability to switch it up. Would love to be able to change the size of the features, they're a butt small",
        "Difficulty No Option to change temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius."

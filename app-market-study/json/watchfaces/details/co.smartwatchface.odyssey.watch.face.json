        "A quality face with plenty of options... Months later:  As best I can tell this face was changed for  Android wear 2.  It isn't the same and lacks features previously available. Difficult to read in various light levels without setting it to max. I am abandoning it.",
        "It says it is installed but does not show up on Android Wear 2.0. This was my favorite watch face but now is useless.",
        "My favourite watch face but now I can't reinstall it on Moto 360.  edit workaround: set interactivity to app which then asks you to pick app on watch, after picking an app both the wear app and watch can see it again. :)",
        "Been looking, but I can't find a watch face that I like better. I just keep coming back to this one. Beautifully done.",
        "I just bought it and it works great with my Ticwatch E! Please dev just add a Notification Reminder always on if its possible on the app settings! Not all the notification works if i don't read something and i don't get a reminder that i have a notification in the background! Also for the steps it takes some time to show the exact steps i made,sometimes it takes even 5 minutes to refresh! Thanks for you work and for your time!  Danke schÃ¶n liebe Dev ðŸ˜Š",
        "This is my #1 favorite watch face. I've gotten complements on it in clubs, before people realize it's a smartwatch.  Seems to have decent battery life.  I really have nothing negative to say about it. Maybe a better selection of weather providers would be nice?  But that hasn't negatively impacted me."

        "I love this. Understated, clean, efficient. Would have 5 stars if the date format could change to DDMMYYYY.",
        "This works well and I really like the idea, but it will randomly decide when to show the date.",
        "Fine, but isn't hexadecimal...",
        "Good concept and clean presentation but misleading name. Provide for actual hex representation and I'll give five stars."

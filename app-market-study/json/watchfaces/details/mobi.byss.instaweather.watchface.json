        "On Asus Zenwatch 2 (square screen), the settings menu is clumped at the top and cannot scroll, so I can't adjust anything. LG Urbane (round screen) does not have this issue, and works as intended...",
        "Like this weather app for wear but some of the information is different on my watch faces to the one's that you see in the play store really hope that Dev team start offering monthly subscriptions of £2 per month instead of the one of payment of£24 a year am sure more people would then purchase premium hope that the Design Team read my review and take up my idea",
        "Issue is fixed now - updating rating!  ~~~~  Used to be my daily watch face for a year, but the latest version no longer works. I don't see the Fit watch face on my watch even though the app on my phone shows it. Tried reinstalling both the phone app and the watch app and neither helped.",
        "Terrible change from vzw to t-mobile and will not load paid a yearly subscription and now it just sits in phone. No response from seller don't buy waste of money.",
        "Well just  install it g0 have not seen it work yet.",

    "description": "Gem Koi Watch Face brings a fresh concept of time telling to your watch. It features a couple of Koi fish pushing the Time Gems around. You can tell the time by looking at the three Time Gems. It might take a while for you to get used to telling the time from the positions of the gems. Hint: The flower helps.The two Koi fish take turn to push the Second gem around. Our first version contains only one color theme. We are adding more themes and options in future versions. For feedback or ideas, send us an email to teragon.android@gmail.com. This is the first public alpha version of the app, so we hope to receive valuable feedback from users to help us improve this.",

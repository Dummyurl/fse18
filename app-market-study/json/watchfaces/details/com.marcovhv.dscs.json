        "Cool I like this watch face. The only downside is that the ambient color doesn't seem to stick and turns white. I saw a comment that the color brightness needs to be past 50% but that does t work for green. It works for red but literally only changing the color (outermost color wheel) ends up with a white dial in ambient mode. I'd also love an option for ambient ticks.",
        "Nice watch face. It needs a separate ambient mode editor. Some color combos don't show up in ambient mode on my Moto360 Sport. It's frustrating to have to pick my screen-on color combo based on what works in ambient and not purely on what color combo I want.",
        "Lovely watch face.... Really like this one, looks cool on my lg. No faults at all, just a suggestion.....perhaps a sweeping \"seconds\" disk would look pretty cool or just a sweeping point on the outer disk....either way, such a sweet looking face, thank you !!",
        "Crashed my nixon Looks great but Nixon mission crashed out on it.",
        "Surprised! All I can say is wow! Unique. Need more unique watch faces like this please.",

        "I like it, and will probably use it the most out of all my watch faces.  The color scheme (shades of brown) isn't something I'd have chosen, but I don't hate it like some of the comments here.  Still, with different color options, this face will be perfect for me.",
        "Brown is horrible. Wanted the black view",
        "I love the ambient mode. Interactive mode is ugly. Maybe bcs it's in brown.",
        "Looks great on my huawei w1. Really clear to see the time and toggling for date is helpful. I like that when you toggle you can see battery for both watch and phone. Great!",

        "Almost like it I appreciate your different approach with creating the whole diet plan with recipes, but I think you should enable users to make some changes to it (considering all sorts of allergies and vegetarian/pescetarian/vegan diets)",
        "What? Why can't I type what I ate. All it let's you do is check off some diet list.please fix it",
        "So close to being awesome :/ I can't type in what I REALLY ate. I love the suggestions but I'm not about to go out and buy all the food the watch suggest as soon as I download it. :/ The ability to customize would be great. Stream line beautiful interface though. No imperial system, only metric. If we wana get really crazy macros would be a great addition as well.",
        "Pretty good start! As others have commented, imperial units would be great. But it sounds like you're already on top of that. There's no way for me to easily see what my daily calorie threshold is after its been calculated.  Aside from adding up all the meal totals or extrapolating from something else.  For me, I would like to set a threshold and jusy track calories conaumed manually. Ideally I'd like to sync with MyFitnessPal and use this app as a dashboard.  I'd even do a one time payment for just that functionality.",
        "Featureless Pointless free version with no features. Lunch at 11am??? Really. Constant spam on moto 360 to use watch face, flattened my battery in hours. Don't waste the download.",

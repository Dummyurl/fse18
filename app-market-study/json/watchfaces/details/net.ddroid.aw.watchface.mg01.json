        "Very nice I only have one issue, I would like an option to bypass the black and white face and head straight to the gear face. Part of the appeal of the Moto 360 is its ability to masquerade as a regular watch until I call up a voice command or swipe up a notification. The black and white preview screen sort of gives it away prior to showing off the android wear features. Other than that, it is absolutely beautiful and elegant, and in my opinion the only watch face in the play store worth the money.",
        "Finally... Been in play store for two hours looking for a watch face for my 360. I really like this one. It's creative and I enjoy the colors of gold and how when it dims it becomes simple and just the elegant black dots best of both worlds. Wish the gear animation could be a little bit more detailed for the money but I don't believe the watch screens are there just yet. Hopefully with more purchases over time the shading and picture quality will increase but for now I could not have found anything better.",
        "Awsome! If you pay close attention you can see all the gears move ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜…",
        "Battery drain Love how it looks. However I did notice it considerably killed my battery. I had the watch blacked out and I only had a few hrs of use with it, while i was at work. Moto 360.",
        "Looks great, but animation is clunky This face has a very nice look to it, but the animation is not smooth at all.",
        "Eh... I do not particularly like the way it looks on moto 360. And I paid for this app,  too."

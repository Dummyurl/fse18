        "Great faces, don't quite fit the Zenwatch 3 perfectly or have a ton of settings so that's why it's only 4 stars. Either way great looking faces, keep up the great work!",
        "Perfection, we want more! I like these because of its minimalistic nature. They're simple, not overcrowded with information, but just the ones I need (I do wish I had an option to change the type of info that's displayed). Further more, the dark background fit my AMOLED display, which in turn saves the battery life of my watch.",
        "Good choice of faces No really great color options but what is there works decently well. If these were broken out into their own package it would be so much better as I only like 2 of the 5 there are.",
        "Great minimalist watch faces! My only complain is that it doesn't fill up the display and makes my watch display look smaller than it actually is.",
        "App looks great, but isn't compatible with the 3rd Gen Fossil Q Explorist. Will update review if this changes in the future.",
        "It neither shows up in the dials of my Moto 360 nor in the android wear app on the phone Guys pls reply.... Why am I having this issue"

    "description": "This application allows to use data in GPX (GPS eXchange) format, such as routes and POI (Points Of Interest), for navigation purposes on Android Wear smart watches. It comes with a free, open source companion app (you'll be prompted to install), which allows to prepare your own routes and POI. You can also take advantage of the large base of bicycle and hiking GPX trails available on the Internet, or convert GPX tracks from your activity tracker into routes.The application offers two watch faces to choose from. Besides telling time, they display full set of navigation data: direction pointer, route point hints, and more in configurable screen widgets: speed, average speed, maximum speed, speed made good, estimated time en route, estimated time of arrival, time elapsed, distance made, time and date, altitude, steps counter, time of sunrise, time of sunset, time to sunrise, time to sunset, heading, bearing, and distance off course. Choose 8 of them to use in the Classic watch face or define 3 switchable sets of 4 widgets in the Active watch face.The application works great as a cyclocomputer, but may become your companion during any other outdoor activity, as a useful addition to activity trackers. It also stores basic stats on time, speed and distance.Supported languages:EnglishGermanPolishPlease test the free app version before buying the paid one.

        "Perfect for cycling and following a recorded GPX track I was looking for an app which would navigate me along a recorded/downloaded track with Wear support. Most apps with wear support were not able to strictly follow the waypoints in a satisfying manner. This app though fulfills my use case 100%. After 4h of navigation I still had about 60% left on my Huawei Watch so a full day should not be a problem. App is simple to use with a lot of thought put into it on what functionality and information is useful when navigating. Fantastic work by the developer!",
        "The best Android Wear navigation app at the moment. Only track recording  missing to make it a 5 star on par with any Garmin GPS watch.",
        "Awesome app Works pretty good I use for hiking and works well on my LG G watch R.",
        "GpxViewer killer app. Beats the heck out of GpxViewer, both with the editing features, filtering, track conversion and smartwatch navigation.",
        "Been looking for an app like this for some time.",
        "Ingenious, beautiful, and useful"
    ],
    "recentChanges": [
        "GXP edition moved to the external Rambler GPX Editor (open source). Manual route point hints abandoned (all the route point hints generated automatically). Navigation to POI includes a bonus feature: you can ask the OSRM Demo Server for a route. Google Maps replaced with the OpenStreetMap."

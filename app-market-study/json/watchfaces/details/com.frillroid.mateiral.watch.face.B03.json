        "Crashes Android Wear App I have been unable to access the watch face settings on both a Samsung Galaxy G4 and a new Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I have only been able to get the default face 8n the collection to appear and even that does not seem to be functioning correctly on my Moto 360. Shame because the faces look like they would be attractive on my watch.",
        "Great faces, good bundle price Bundle was a great deal. My 3 favorite watch faces!",
        "Will not send to wear Watch faces are good. Never had a problem with any other faces on SW3 or Zen Watch. Simply will not send the updated watch chioce to the watch. It just loads and sits on the default face.",

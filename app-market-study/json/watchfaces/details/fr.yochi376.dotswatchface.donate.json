        "Can't change the default settings on the watch face. Settings lock up whenever I try to open them. Emailed the creator about it and have not gotten a response. Looks cool but settings is a big deal.  *Edit Settings do work through Android Wear app as creator suggested. I was having issues with wear app as well but after an update it's working much better and I'm able to change settings. Thanks.",
        "Have enough custom options to really make look the way you want and I love this watch face",
        "It works well, it looks just as shown. Pretty cool, I'm usually switching watch faces every few days, but I have to say this ones really grabbed a lot of screen time for me due to its simplicity.",
        "Favorite watch face! This is honestly the best watch face I've used so far, which is saying a lot because I've had my smart watch for well over a year, and I change the face almost 3 times every week. I have been using this face for almost a week now and am very satisfied with it, its features are useful and the design is sleek. It's especially cool to me because I do hobby electronics and it remindes me of that one board for the raspberry pi.",
        "I really enjoy your watchface but it's not perfect Don't get me wrong, it's a great job well done but I would add more features like battery percentage or the option to not have the date in dim mode."

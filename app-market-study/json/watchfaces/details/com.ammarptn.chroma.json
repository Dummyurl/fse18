        "It's OK, tbh I don't really see this being a paid watch face. I've tried a lot of faces and this one looks nice and I like the way it functions, but I wish there was more customization. And once you touch to change thru the different info displays it stays there even after the screen goes off which can be annoying. It should return back to displaying clock, or at least have the option.",
        "Nice and looks cool for Moto gen2 I wish there was an option to reduce the spectrum colour width in increments to the outta edge. The spectrum looks a bit thick to me imho and would be nice for the option to reduce it.",

        "Excellent face...needs updating... The face is perfect while active. But the ambient mode needs updating for non-LCD screens. For the OLED based screens, leave the color, and remove the unnecessary pixels (the neon wires), to save battery during ambient mode. So I guess there would have to be a watch/screen option to accomplish this. Add this option and it is perfect. But if you can live with these nitpicking, it is one of the best watch faces.",
        "Another great face ruined by black&white ambient mode. Why make a beautiful watch face and ruin it with an awful ambient mode. Give me the option to use ambient or not. You forced me to get a refund. Fix that and I'll repurchase and promote. also, l=no response from developer on this dim issue. if they're not even willing to address yes or no just avoid this face.",
        "Love the way it looks. Working well on my 360 Sport. Think I would like the ability to do a bit of customising, only reason it is not 5 stars.   Edit: Unfortunately this watch face causes massive disconnection with the phone. As soon as activated, starts disconnecting.",
        "Great watch face, just need an option for simpler DIM mode (without all the extra wires, lines and arrows, only keep the essential info) and it's perfect.",
        "Nice Love this. 5 stars if you implement an animation that resembles the flicker of neons switching on from ambient. That would be awesome!",

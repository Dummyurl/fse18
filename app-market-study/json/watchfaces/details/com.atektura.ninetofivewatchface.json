        "Great watch app. Love it. It would be awesome to allow digital and analog at the same time. Also appointments to show. So if I have meeting scheduled it would show up in the time ring similar to the lunch time. Some sort extended appointment view because android wear does notify me if I have a upcoming appointment soon.",
        "Very cool but could do something awesome I just bought a copy of your watch face and I am very pleased. Have you thought about interfacing with the calendar so you can show busy times throughout the day like you do with the lunch break?",
        "Great App - Small Suggestion The app is great and has a lot of customization but it would be nice to set individual times for each week day. I have one day in my week which is different than the others. Also please add option for break times in addition to lunch.",
        "Edit- First 2 days had poor battery seems better now Using about 10% of battery for moto 360. It is the highest battery user of all on my watch. Higher than screen. Getting about 12 hours is all.  Edit- The first two days this watch face was the highest battery user but since it has dropped down and I am getting normal battery life again!",
        "Small night shift quirk I work 11pm to 7am, but putting that in, the info tells me I have 30 hours left to my shift. I hope not! So for right now I have to leave the text off. The visual elements still work for me plenty. Just a shame the text is acting up for me..",
        "Useless if you work at different times This app is worthless to me until individual times can be assigned to each day, keep in mind each week is different times too. Would be great if it can use data from Google Calendar."

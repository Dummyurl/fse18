        "10 Stars Brotherman! Downloaded this face and The Flash version and I love them both! Only piece of advice would be make daytime the default colors you start with. Haha I spent 15 minutes changing all kinds of colors around until I flicked nighttime to day and it was almost exactly what I wanted aside from some widget changes. The daytime is just much closer to what their symbols actually look like and was what I expected upon download. But overall very killer faces bro and keep up the good work. Also dropping 5 stars on Flash!",
        "Cant use Hey dude. I cant use this and i dont know why. I have a galaxy gear s2 and it runs android wear but it still wont work. If you cant fix it i want a refund please",
        "Very unstable It takes at least 2 seconds to show up.  First it's just black screen and white  numbers.  Very awkward when you're trying to show your cool watch with a not so cool watch face.",
        "Good design Like the design. One thing tho (and have found same with Steampunk face) the step counter and weather widgets have stopped working, they just stay on default. Otherwise lovely app.",
        "App does not work with android wear 2. Shows that it installed in the play store but does not show up on the watch or in the android wear app. DO NOT BUY!  Seller response: Word up Jonathan, well obviously something when wrong for you... try to reinstall it. Don't you think you're pushing it with the \"not buy\" comment tho? It's working for thousands of ppl, and i like to help but your bad faith is not making it easy.  My response: I've tried deleting, installing, and reinstalling. Maybe instead of using the same response to everyone that complains that it is not working with android wear 2 you might consider that you need to fix something. Then I will remove my warning to others not to buy.",
        "I just purchased this watch face but it's not showing up on my android wear app and have no way of setting up on my Fossil Q Founder... my device is running Android wear 2.0 and phone 7.0 and I have power cycled both devices and waited like 15-20min and still nothing..."

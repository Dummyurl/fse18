It's for cool people only, so be sure you are fit for it before acquiring it (we are sure you are, you are an Android Wear user after all ;) ).The watch face is available in 10 different colors, so you can match it with your mood and/or style whatever it is (sure, if you are feeling radioactive one day then you can wear green or yellow, or any other color you might think it's okay).It comes with a unique design that works with any watch shape (circular or square), so you don't have to worry about the design not fitting your watch's screen (see the sample images).This watch face is specially designed using the official Watch Face API from Google, which means that it's optimized for low energy consumption when using your watch in ambient mode and for helping protect your watch's screen when used with burn-in protection.

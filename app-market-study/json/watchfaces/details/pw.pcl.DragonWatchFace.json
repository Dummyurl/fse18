Each Chinese zodiac Kanji is located at the position of 1 through 12. The 24-hour hand indicates the current Chinese zodiac time. The concept of this watch face is described below.In the pre-modern Japan, Chinese zodiac had been used as a name of time. Chinese zodiac is represented by the name of animals and so on. They are rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and boar. Everyone is represented as single Kanji. The period of before and after midnight, a total of 2 hours, is called \"time of rat\". Every next 2 hours, it goes to the order of zodiac as \"time of ox\", \"time of tiger\", \"time of rabbit\" until the  \"time of boar\" and then return back to \"time of rat\".

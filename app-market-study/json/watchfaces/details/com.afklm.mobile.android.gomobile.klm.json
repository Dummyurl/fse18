        "Terrible app full of bugs.",
        "So far... A useless App for adding and paying for excess baggage. I am guessing, it is the same for moving flight dates. Shame really. I was hoping the App would be convenient and reliable.",
        "Terrible app. Looks good but a lot of critical things don't work. I couldn't check in cos the 'issue date' calendar only goes past 1970. Can't select seats. Airports are missing from flight status area.  Cant see recent transactions. You'd be left disappointed with the app.",
        "Terrible app, nothing appears to work. Unable to add passport details to profile.  Unable to click the link presented to add passport details during check in. Utterly pointless why did they even bother",
        "Unable to check-in as the link to add passport details did not work.  Tried to add passport to profile only to receive an application error. Under the circumstances, I think that my two stars are generous.",
        "Works well to check-in but it disappointed me in an important case. KLM rescheduled my flight but the app was showing the original departure date ... It didn't synchronise and mislead me."

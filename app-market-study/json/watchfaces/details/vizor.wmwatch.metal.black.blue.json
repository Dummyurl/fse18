        "Fantastic watch face. I have two minor suggestions, both related to ambient mode. An option for a \"higher quality\" that shows the texture background and better graphics in ambient mode would be nice. Obviously this would drain more battery, but the g watch r and urbane batteries are monsters and could most likely handle it. Additionally, there is a bug with the burn in prevention and colors. One of the dots got moved almost off of the screen and turned red rather than my defined color of mustard.",
        "Perfect except... I tried the free for a couple hours.  Loved it.    Then decided to upgrade. Even told my colleagues about it.  Here are some issues I'd like to see addressed.  Battery life lasts about 4hrs (moto360).  Also could you add a way to save preferences?  As expected, I am redoing my settings.  Great work!",
        "Settings are not saved, forces me to restart my phone every day Loved the free version,  so I decided to purchase the full. Now I have to restart my phone every day - otherwise my watches battery depletes in 6hours. Second problem is that the settings are not being saved - I change the color and a few hours later it goes back to blue.  Happens every time!",
        "It's nice for a bit Then I realised I couldn't see it too well outside.  Would like the ability to change background colour.   Thay would make it amazing.   Has all the details I need to hand.   Just wish I could use this face more,  but there are other ones which are clearer during daylight hours.  I find myself shielding this one to be able to view it",
        "Good Not great, why do the calendar events dissappear when the watch dim (goes into ambient mode). It should be possible to decide what will dissappear in ambient mode. Also, its too dark in ambient mode, even with highest \"brightness\"",
        "After update to 5.1.1 there is a lot of lag. Needs work. I did restart both watch and phone but it did not help. Lag appears to be only with Vizor Watch. Other Watchmaker faces work fine."

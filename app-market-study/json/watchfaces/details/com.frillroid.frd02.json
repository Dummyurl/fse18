        "I can't get the thing to work. I downloaded it on my phone and my watch, and when trying to configure it on the phone, it says \"Low Internet Connection\". I tried to \"reload\" and I still get the same error. This is when both devices are connected to the same wi-fi that is not \"low\". The watchface is set to the default location set by the developer and is thus useless for knowing the weather for my area.  This is the second watchface that I have had problems with from this developer.",
        "I really like this. At last today I have been able to download this again after a few attempts in the past week or so. And today it finally installed on my watch and I am very pleased with this watch face. I would like to apologise to the developer for my initial negative review.",
        "Looks great Loving the design so far,  wish you could mix notifications.  (Phone battery and watch battery etc)",

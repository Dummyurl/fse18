        "Could be better If it had different size widgets i.e. smaller widgets, or no widget on the phone as this app says its for wear... Also if on the wear round display you could change the position of the step notification i.e. it says 'fitbit updates', you have to swipe it up to see the step count. Would be way better if you could just see the step count",
        "Wouldn't link to fitbit on phone. So it never did anything. So I don't know yet.",
        "Crashes! It is so stupid and is a waste of time!",
        "useless Doesn't do anything with Android Wear....",
        "It does not rotate every 20 seconds My app does not rotate every 20 seconds on my Samsung S5.  Please fix",
        "Also won't work on BLU R1 HD. Doesn't show up as an available widget."

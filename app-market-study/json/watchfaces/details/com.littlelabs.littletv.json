        "Requires restart on LG G Watch R For those of you who are reporting issues on the LG G Watch R version, try rebooting your phone and watch. Once rebooted the app should install. You're welcome, interwebz",
        "Do any of the settings even work? Can't stop that annoying notification, even if I'm not using the face, selecting a channel doesn't do anything, they all seem random.  It's cool but needs some work, it's really just a watch face to demo for friends nothing more.  Going to uninstall cause of the notification",
        "Error The app will suddenly stop working and I have to switch watch faces and go back to it on Moto 360. Sucks the watch battery too. Good idea if it worked. Uninstalled it.",
        "Almost, but not quite. Same gifs in rotation, doesn't seem to download new ones, can't make changes through phone app, watch UI is super clunky, doesn't allow to use own gifs, and takes up way too much storage. Cool idea implemented very badly.",
        "Cool idea, to little content, bad gui Expect to see the same images over and over and over. Clunky channel surfing.messages saying switch to WiFi. Fun for 10 minutes total",
        "Doesn't work on lg g watch r Have the 5.0 update and does not work on watch installed multiple times to no avail."

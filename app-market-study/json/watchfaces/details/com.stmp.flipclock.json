        "Great Looking but it won't install on my Fossil Q Founder  Updated since first install I have more knowledge of my Fossil and now find this app really amazing, it looks great and performs very well! I am really enjoying it. üòÅ",
        "Looks amazing on my Huawei watch and is fun to customize!  Edit: I have the same watch but a new phone. Custom tags worked when I  had the LG phone  but aren't working with my Samsung S8. Would that make a difference?  Edit2: I didn't see the big blue checkmark to set my changes.  It's all good now!!",
        "Love the face but wont stop asking for permissions and it wont let you set them .. such a shame pls fix. Lg g watch r & edge 7  wear 2.0 i think UPDATE: for anyone having the same issue i had whereby the watch locked on the permissions screen... uninstall from both watch and phone then reinstall and it works second time round :)",
        "I keep going back to this face set up the interactives and it's all good.",
        "Great watch.  Great customization.",
        "Its a nice watch face. Only thing that annoys me a little, is the date format doesn't seem to be changeable, or if it is, it's hidden in a horribly busy config app"

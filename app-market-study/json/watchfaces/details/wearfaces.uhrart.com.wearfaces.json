        "interface is lacking, also didn't work after the first face was created, failed a few times to send to watch and experience is extremely underwhelming. But this app is exciting, when they get it right it'll be a huge success - until then, I'd wait for updates.",
        "Really adds HQ watch faces Incredible selection of distinct, clean designs. Watch three \"how to\" video to install properly. Not perfect, when trying to customize beyond designers faces... Sometimes it's not recognized by my Asus Zenwatch 2.",
        "Easy learning curve Made my own face;(syfi theme); which is now my favorite.... wish there were more items to add, like adding a compass or other things. Enjoy your cup of java....",
        "Good app Only just getting into customising my west faces and so far this is really good. Sometimes a little laggy but overall it works very well. Would recommend...",
        "Designer Very nice app. There are literally hundreds of watch faces you can choose from but if you can't find one you like use this instead. You can choose any image and have it as a watch face.",
        "Can't seem to do all on my phone I wish the photos added for hands would auto size. I am not sure how I can resize pics on my phone for this app. And now that the wrong size pics are used, I cant take them off. Need a reset button. Im stuck with my photos for hour/min/seconds taking up full screen on watch...help please. I did donate :)"

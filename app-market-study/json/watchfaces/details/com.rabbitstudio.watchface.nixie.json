        "Nice design For those of us without amoled displayed, any chance you could re-add the option for the full watch face in ambient mode?",
        "Basic but works and looks great on my round faced watch; however, on my square faced watch, it looks offset and the first and last digits are smaller. It wasn't like that before but a couple months ago it changed and hasn't been fixed, yet.",
        "Great looking. One of the nicest nixie tube faces out there.",
        "Only displays 24 hour format. Ambient mode not an option. No seconds.",
        "Cool",
        "Does not work!!!!!  S6 with moto 360!! Followed instructions waited multiple minutes.  Closed and restarted everything and nothing showed up.  Probably a scam."

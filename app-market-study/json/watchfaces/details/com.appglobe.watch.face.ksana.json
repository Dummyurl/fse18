        "Have not loaded onto Sony Smartwatch 3. I don't know what you've done on this update, but I'm getting at least 3 days now on my Huawei Watch 2 Sport LTE instead of 2 days. So top marks just for that. I do use other faces but always come back to this one.  Keep up the good work.",
        "great watch face! i do have a suggestion hopefully you will consider. could you please add brightness controls for ambienrlt mode? i found that displaying just watch hands in ambient mode is still quite bright especially at night. thanks!",
        "Great watch face for the Huawei watch 2. I would like to be able to remove the minute marks if possible in interactive mode. Or at least make them more faint.",
        "Five stars because it does what it claims. It doesn't do everything under the sun, but it does the basic things that someone needs. And it's not a battery killer. Good job!",
        "The best watch face so far. Really like the customization part",
        "Easy to set up watchface. Setup time less than 5 minutes."

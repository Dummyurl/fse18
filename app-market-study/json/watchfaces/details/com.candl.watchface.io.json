        "Really nice watchface I've been using this watchface on my Moto 360 and I have to say I really like it. The overall design and transitions are very nice, but I've noticed a couple aren't entirely smooth. For example, the gradient towards the 'flat-tire' at the bottom of the 360 sometimes takes about a second to appear, and as nice as it looks when it does finally make it, I'd rather just not have it there if it means a janky animation. The switch back to ambient display is also not that smooth as the clock jumps down, but that's not too big of an issue for me as I don't use that mode.   Currently, the one thing preventing me from using this as my primary watch face is the battery drain issue - not sure what this is caused by, but if it is fixed I will be able to wholeheartedly recommend this face.  Edit: Practically all of my issues with this watchface have been fixed, increased to 5 stars.",
        "Really love the look, too much battery drain I'm in love with this watch face. Very well executed. However, I'm experiencing a ton of battery drain on my 360 while using this one. Hopefully it can get fixed... I want to use it again!",
        "Please fix It's a great watch face, but use outlines in idle mode instead of filled shapes because sometimes I can see it start to burn in.",
        "Great I really love how it looks, but it doesn't have the best contrast between numbers and background. I can't see the hour at a glance.",
        "Pretty cool Would like it if the watch face didn't slow down my watch. Sometimes it takes 3 seconds for the screen to come on when I touch it. It's cool, but could use some more features too.",
        "Great little i/o watch face! Love the Google font on this watch face and the nice material animation as it becomes active! Thanks for making it, great work! Maybe just a couple of additional options for weather or battery could be added."

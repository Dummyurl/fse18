        "Digging This One, Using it Daily Nice compromise between analog and digital. Super easy to tell what time it is. Hoping to see more customization options in the future, specifically choosing what info displays on the bottom and what order to cycle it through. Also an option to remove the shadow on ambient so that the entire number shows up.",
        "Does not work. Only displays the time, everything else doesn't work. When I tap on the weather/calendar/etc, it says \"loading\" indefinitely and nothing shows up. UPDATE: Fixed after checking permissions of the app itself. However, I expect the app to ask for permission instead of just crashing. Just bad code.",
        "Great Update! I am truly enjoying this watch face. There is one thing I would like on the next update is more HD like text. One can see the anti-aliasing a but when it is in ambient mode. I have the huawei watch. Great app!",
        "Almost there The darkened time doesn't show up in Ambient Mode on my Sony Smartwatch 3 (probably because it declares low bit mode but actually can display grayscale).  Card previews overlap with bottom text.  Otherwise a well designed face.",
        "Not sure if the dev is still active, but I would love it if the\"tap here to do x\" features were optional, as I just want a watchface without all the bells and whistles",
        "Daily watch face It really needs a vibrate on connect/disconnect function added though"

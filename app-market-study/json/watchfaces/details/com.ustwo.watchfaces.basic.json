        "These are some of the best watchfaces you can get for AW smartwatches. I'd give 5 stars but, I don't think the Hud watchface's ambient mode is burn in safe since the digital clock font is 'fill' type instead of outline. I suggest you take a look at this",
        "Well-designed, fairly simple watch faces. Would be great if we could actually select the colors for the faces that constantly change color.",
        "Great collection of well thought out and designed faces, instantly growing your collection with usable options, not tat.",
        "Some of the best watch faces for Android wear. Well designed and clean.",
        "Some really lovely faces, simple and elegant designs.",
        "Earlier versions lacked flexibility in options. Much more functional watch faces that are well designed."

        "The last bit of glue was still hardening when he booted up the system. The screen read “0418 -- 0 Steps.” A grin spread on his face.",
        "• Added Watch Face Complication support - find them under “data” in each watch face settings menu!"

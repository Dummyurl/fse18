        "Fantastic Watchface - I paid for WatchMaker Premium specifically so I could use this particular watch face on my LG Urbane! I do wish there was an alternative color scheme though - like a dark blue/dark green. The orange is a little distracting when  driving  in the dark.",
        "Fantastic design and animation! Absolutely love the design and the color on the deep blacks of my LG Watch R OLED screen. Its even unlocked so you can mod if you want to.  And its FREE...what else can you ask for. Thanks a LOT for this gift!",
        "Beautiful design Frank is a genius with watch face design. His creations  embrace the technology and make it fun to wear his designs. This is one is awesome",
        "? Doesn't work on huawei watch? Downloaded it can't find it on watch or in Android wear.",
        "Great watchface Great watchface big fan of technical  themed watchfaces my only request would be to increase  timeout when you hit the screen  otherwise   great  theme",
        "Can't see it Can't see it on my hauwai watch."

        "Good app. Any one know how to change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit on the watch? I have a Huawei watch.",
        "Very nice watch face, however is the Google fit data being pulled in correctly? My step counter doesn't match what i have in Google Fit, in fact it's out by nearly 3000 steps. Happy to increase the rating if this gets fixed.",
        "Very nice design. One suggestion for future feature. Would you be able to make it interactive? So when I touch the weather it goes to weather, or when I touch the date it goes to my agenda?",
        "A great and beautiful battery drainer.",
        "Good watchface.   Good response from developer.",
        "The first watch face that shows all the info I need and it's nice and uncluttered."

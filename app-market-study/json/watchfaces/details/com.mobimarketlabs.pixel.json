        "Cannot get 12 hour mode to work. Stays on 24 hr time. My watch is the Huawei 2 Classic.",
        "Needs to have customizable colours for both numbers and orange band. The second time needs to work instead of showing SEL. Needs option to disable steps or secondary time.",
        "Watch face doesn't even show up in Android wear. I'd like a refund please",
        "Great watchface Well laid out, great looking ambient mode. I had a problem with the missed calls count, but the developers were very helpful and found and fixed it in a few days. Very pleased.",
        "Love this watch face. Only fix it need is I see that the SMS counter does not reset after reading the unread messages. Please please fix."

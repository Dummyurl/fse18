        "Different, very friendly First time I feel I need to give stars. With so many watch faces,and they all look similar. Works, looks perfect on lg round.",
        "Great watch face and responsive dev I really like this watch face; very configurable and the animation is smooth. Had a small bug when I first bought it, and the developer was very responsive and fixed it quickly.",
        "Incredibly Broken It's not working at all on my Asus Zenwatch. I expected better. Please update and fix because I like the minimalistic and animation heavy idea for the watch face.",

        "Random glitch Worked great on Asus zenwatch 2, looked good, do wish it was a bit more customisable, but a good looking watch none the less. But main issue is after about 1 hour of use image went dark grey all over with only a few specks of light grey on image - so ugly looking. Watch set to screen off, so its not just showing a battery save screen mode. Changing to different watch face and back to this one did not resolve. Good but could be so much better!",
        "Was nice for a day Then it blanked out. Must be a bug. Other faces work. I restarted my watch. Didn't work. Uninstalled, didn't work. Love it though over all.",
        "Very clean look, almost real Except when in ambiance mode. The pixelation is bad, but could be part of the watch, not the watchface.",
        "Nice, from the advertised picture. Very flat 2D looks, ugly on G Watch R. Din't like it.",
        "Nothing happens Installed it and it's nowhere to be found on my  Xperia z5 compact. I emailed the devs and nothing. Pointless.",
        "It appears wierd after the first day, its mostly black and has some features of the watch, but still, need to be fixed!"

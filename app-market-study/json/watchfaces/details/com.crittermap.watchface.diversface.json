    "description": "This is a Watch Face made to resemble a Diver's Watch.As you can see, it is an analog watch face. It is adapted for both round and square screens. It has the date with three letters for the month and up to two digits for the day of the month. Please refer to manufacturer's guidance on the water resistant rating of your watch. Most Android Wear Watches are IPX6 or IPX7 rated. This means at most, you will be able to submerge your watch to one meter for 30 minutes. You probably won't take it diving. Installing this watch face will not make your watch more waterproof, nor is it actually recommended for diving, but it will make you more stylish, and allow you think about diving during your everyday life. Look at our screenshots above to imagine yourself in the ocean's depths. Get this Divers Watch Face for Android Wear today!",

        "Great simple watch face! *Suggestion change colors like the square version of this watch face and be able to change the center to other things like temperature, or steps*",
        "Dude one of the best ambient display screens I ever use, please add the features to remove battery indicator and be able to change tickness of the Numbers",
        "Excellent abstract design. I like it very much on my moto360 1st Gen. Thank you",
        "Looks great. I wish it would have colors options",
        "Original Design.",
        "It installs on my phone just fine but I can't find it within my watch's Wear 2.0 Play Store and it doesn't show up as an on-watch notification to install it on my ZenWatch 3. This app apparently hasn't been updated to be compatible with Wear 2.0."

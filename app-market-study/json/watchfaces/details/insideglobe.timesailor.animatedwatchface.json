        "It looks great and works well, BUT it constantly crashes on my phone and I have to dismiss it multiple times each day. It also seems to drain the battery much more than other watch faces. It also shows the wrong temperature consistently and never changes.",
        "Great looking but lags... Not anymore! This gave was great to begin with. After a few updates and the lagging started. Now it is so bad, I can't use it.          *EDIT* New update brought it back to life. Using it now and bumped it up to 4 stars. It does still lag a bit, but it could be my Moto360 1st gen causing that.",
        "Unusable laggy The boat is moving every one second and the seconds increment by 3. When I installed this watchface, it crashed my watch and restarted. Entering menu take suspiciously long. Good idea but pretty bad implementation.",
        "A very nice idea, that still need some bugfixing and optimization. By now, the face isn't usable on my Gear Live, but the art concept is stunning, and the developer's promises to fix the animation make me believe that one day I'll be able to use this face, so I will not request a refund.   EDIT: the developers fixed many bugs, and now doesn't crash anymore. Unfortunately it's still too slow on my watch specially during swiping in and out of main screen, and can't be used daily.",
        "Nice watchface! But it lags on Moto 360 so unfortunately it's a refund for me.",
        "Weather never did show temp, followed instructions and waited, but no. So not keeping an app that isn't up to standard.."

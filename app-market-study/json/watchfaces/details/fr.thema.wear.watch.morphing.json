I say \"could\", because the the watch face has the annoying habit of inadvertently entering the settings (a long press anywhere on the screen is enough, with no \"lock\" system EDIT: this is apparently the default beahviour for all watch faces - but then thema should introduce some other option for of locking the colour schemes and the settings.). , so when i carry my watch around I often find myself with all my colour schemes and complications randomly modified..."

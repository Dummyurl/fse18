        "Using iOS with an LG G Watch R on Android Wear 2.0 - lots of watch faces can be download directly from the watch now but not my favourite (this one!) sadly. Hoping for an update!",
        "Very nice !!! This one's a keeper....any chance of making the lines disappear and also lowering the brightness of the clock a touch when it's in ambient mode....?, cheers...",
        "I really like this but no 12 hour option so no 5 Star till it happens. As it is useless for me.",
        "So cool! Really would like to see a 12 hr format for 5 stars!",
        "I would give it a 5 if in 12 hour format.",
        "12 hr please I love it, animation is awesome. Just wish I could switch it the 12 hour format"

        "Missing?  -edit x2 I've downloaded 3 different watch face apps. Play store shows all three installed, but I can't find them on my phone.  Please help. Edit... I increased my rating to 3 stars because of the developers response to my problem.  Yet... I shouldn't have even had the problem. Edit... Installed and found only two faces available... Where's the ability to create faces?",
        "Brilliant Never had a watch maker before because they look too complicated. No such troubles with this app. Very well done. Just needs some more complications",
        "Good idea, needs a touch more  The options are not quite enough. The digital displays need to be able to be larger. Time and date at the same time. Trio looks poor in ambient mode. All admittedly mode should allow full color and brightness.",
        "Good Designs Already Built If I had 1 request it would be that you let us download ONLY the watch faces we choose. (hint, hint!) Then you'll get my 5 Stars.",
        "Nice idea Very limited. Not many colour options. Standby face is ugly.",
        "Really nice watch faces. Simple and minimal. For those having trouble select the watch face through the android wear app and then long press the watch face on your watch to customise."

She was beginning to give up hope of a long signal burst with coordinates when she remembered something that Paul had said. She ran to the 25-25, broke out a section of board and fused the two remaining parts together. BEEP BEEP BEEP.",

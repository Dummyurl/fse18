        "It seems to be okay, but there are a few problems.  The main problem being that the step counter doesn't ever reset.  I have check Google Fit and it resets, but the indicator's counter does not.  I've tried messaging the Dev on FB with this issue, and a few feature requests, with no answer.",
        "It doesn't say you need to buy the premium, just to use a custom photo background. Misadvertising.",
        "Almost love it, would be nicer if the font size of the digits around the watch to be smaller, similar to your classic version. that would fix the overlapping multi display circles on top and bottom of the watchface",
        "Great customizations, but also some things missing I would expect to find. It loses a star for not giving an option to hide the watch face markers in ambient mode.",
        "Its got some great customizations but i can't figure out how to us the default aw2.0 complications.",
        "This is the best watch face out there I think there are a possible 17 quick buttons and it's able to launch any app on your phone and any picture you want can be set as the watch face it would get a 5 star if they add a crop to the photo selector so you can fine tune the photo *using premium* well worth the cost"

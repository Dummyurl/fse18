        "Face hands messed up The face worked for a while, but now everything is messed up.  Hands and dials are not aligned.  Contacted developer, included photo, no response. Using Moto 360 gen 2.",
        "Not impressed Looks unrefined. Flickers when screen turns on before the full face shows.",
        "Eh I kinda like it. Wished it looked a little more refined. A little too cartoony looking. The main reason for the 2 star rating is that when the screen of the moto 360 turns on, only the back dial and numbers appear at first and all the other dials and details appear about a second after the screen is on. Kind of annoying. I hope this gets fixed in the future so I could give this app another try. Until then I'll be getting a refund. Sorry.",
        "Nice watch face! 4 stars because it letts me have a nice fancy looking analog clock without actually having to read it. I love how there is a little digital clock and date that tells you the time like a SMART watch should. -1 because it takes a little while to fully turn on upon unlocking like almost all other non OEM faces.",
        "like this a lot. Could you please add the same features as your A06 watch face. US date format option and battery percentage please? Love your work! Thank you :-)"

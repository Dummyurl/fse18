        "Good, not great The design alone is good. I'd like to see other options for the lower dial, like those on the dev's other watch faces (weather, battery, etc.). The compass doesn't work, no matter how much you try to calibrate it. 4 stars if that's fixed, 5 for step/cycling sync with Fit.",
        "Very nice! Compass works on Huawei Awesome face. It would be nice to test the colors without the app screen going back to main option screen every color change. Small complaint for a working compass on the huawei.",
        "Doesn't do what it should. ..steps don't get counted properly. .if it worked if use it. ..another watch face disappointment. Ok watch face to look at.",
        "Pedometer doesn't work anymore The pedometer on this watch used to be reasonably accurate, and match up more or less with Google Fit, now it is typically several thousand steps short.",
        "Garbage I've installed it... so where is the watchface? Doesn't show up in Android wear.",
        "May be my favorite face. Not a ton of customization options, but in this case that's good, it saves you from yourself when you want to screw around with a really sharp design. Love being able to put my initials on it. Great feature, like developer's other faces."

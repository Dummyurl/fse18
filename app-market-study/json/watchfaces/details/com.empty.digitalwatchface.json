        "Don't know if this is something I'm doing wrong or not.  I downloaded this and loved it, then I had to reset my watch to factory settings and lost it.  Now it won't let me download it again, because it claims I've already done it.  Is there a way to get it back?",
        "No 12.hour mode How do I change to the 12 hour mode? In the Play Store the pics show 12.hour format, but when downloaded on my watch, it shows 24.",
        "It's okay. The background red could be dialed down a bit, and the ambient mode isn't that pretty."

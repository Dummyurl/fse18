        "Hanafi Asr choice doesn't work. I've sent numerous emails via the app and directly through the website detailing the fault with photos showing the mistake and have never got a reply back from the developer. I asked if they knew that Asr prayer has 2 options in the app but instead of showing the Asr time slightly differently ,according to whether you select the HANAFI option or the MALIKI/HANBALI/SHAFI option, it shows the same time. If you have this option in a prayer app then you must understand what it means and then make sure that it works otherwise it puts into question your credibility. I don't know why the developer will not reply to me or engage with me. All I want is the app to work.",
        "My favorite prayer time app for Android. The widget is a huge time saver to see the next prayer and countdown and as well as the qibla tracker is very accurate. So happy that the widget also updates time in its own now without having to open the app itself!",
        "It is a good app, but disappointed because could not restore my previous purchase to remove ads and have widgets",

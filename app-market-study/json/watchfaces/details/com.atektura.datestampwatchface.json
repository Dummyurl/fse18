        "Nice Design I like this watch face a lot, simple and elegant. Perhaps and option to increase the size of the battery info as it's just suffering a little, in terms of legibility at the moment. A colour palette to change the background would be nice, or even a photo background option for unique customisation..",
        "Neat looking face. It's nice to change it up every now and then. At first I was disappointed that the \"stamp\" constantly shifted but then I found the setting to make it static. Now I'm happy!",
        "Cute but grows tired The watchface is kinda cute, but it gets boring quickly. I wish it had a setting not to shrink for card previews. Also, goes against the developer guidelines by adding a launcher icon for no reason.",
        "Phone battery instead That matters more since watch I can easily see, phone battery I'll have to pull it out of pocket.",
        "Unable to see it on my phone Using Sony Smartphone 3 and the option for the face isn't available in my Android wear app.",
        "Pretty good Maybe have an option for different date formats (for example, have date written as 1 March 2016 instead of March 1, 2016)"

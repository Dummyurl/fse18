If a notification is present, the face will smoothly reduce to fill the remaining space.Behind the watch face itself is a fully animated galaxy, and you can take control there, too.  Select from different themes and adjust the movement speed and behavior.  Touch the screen to change the camera angle, or have it move with the orientation of the watch itself.NOTE: Our watch faces require Android 5.0 on your Wear device.  They fully respect sleep mode, and will fade in the moving background when you wake the device.  Both round and square faces are fully supported.Check your Android Wear app to set!We don't yet have a video for this product, but you can check out the behavior of the live wallpaper version here : http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fishnoodle.spacescapewallpaper",

        "Amazingly customizable when compared to other galaxy watch faces. Works seamlessly without any awkward glitches in the galaxy movement (Huawei Watch). That being said, it would be nice if there were more time hand options (more minimalist like mirage?) That felt a little more premium and clean. Also, it would be nice if you could freeze the orientation of the rotating galaxy for an aerial view, side view, etc. Lastly, a cleaner, more contrast nebula with less foggy color would be nice. Giving five stars because hard working developer who I believe will keep updating with more features, better efficiency, and cleaner styles!",
        "Really good! My favourite watch design out of everything currently on Play Store! Just wish there was an option to change what parts of the watch face appear in ambient mode.",
        "Needs to be updated to Android Wear 2.0.",
        "Moto 360 Looks great but there are a few little problems. The main issue I'm having is that the image seems to go off centre leaving a black bar at the top of the watch.",
        "Crashes Moto 360 Watch face caused my Moto 360 to lock up in ambient screen mode and lose the connection to the phone.  The lock up made the watch reset its self a couple of times.  Also the watch battery decreased by about 30% in the hour or so this was installed.",
        "Top 10 Watch font is not my favorite but the background and options are great. I loved the wallpaper and the watch face is no different."

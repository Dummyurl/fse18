        "I installed this on my Galaxy S7 Edge for use with my Huawei watch and I love it. It''s beautiful and works great. I love being able to see my steps and the weather along with the battery level of both my phone and my watch right on the watch face. So cool and useful.  My brother also installed it on his Galaxy S6 Edge for use with his Huawei watch, and he also loves the features and the way it looks, but he's having a problem with it that I'm not having.  The Fuel watch face is causing heavy battery drain on his Huawei watch for some reason. Before switching to this watch face, he would have about 40% battery remaining at the end of the day when he took off the watch and put it on the charger. Wit the Fuel watch face, he is down below 5% battery remaining by the end of the day.  Does anyone know why this watch face would be causing such high battery drain on his watch?",
        "Love it!!! Very generous to offer for free for 3 days but still very nice (not just complimenting because of freebie) Love a nice colorful analog watchface any day!!! Thank You",
        "Found my phone battery severely drained more than usual today. Fuel had used half the battery percent drained!",
        "The weather widget no longer update data per interval. Please fix this bug. Hope there's an option to change to show a bigger watch battery only since the phone battery number is never accurate on my watch anyway.",
        "Beautiful Analog watchface I have been searching for an Analog watchface with the right mix of color and detail and this one fits the bill perfectly. Well done",
        "Love the watchface but how do I change the settings to C instead of F for the weather?"

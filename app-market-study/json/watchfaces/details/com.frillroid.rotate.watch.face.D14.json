        "Add custom colour options and a way to get rid of the numbers being cut off I would like to see custom colour options, seeing as I paid for it that's what I'd expect. Also on my Moto 360 the numbers at the bottom are cut off because of the 'flat tyre' design which I kind of hate",
        "Not working!!! Like mentioned by Andrew its not working or showing up on my watch or phone!! Is this a rip off?? Please explain?",
        "Good face I noticed the face shifts off center, when in ambient mode, also when it's 12:00 the 12 comes out as 00 reading 00:00 please fix.",
        "Twenty four hour format ???? Twenty four hour format not supported and wouldn't mind seeing some color adjustability and ambient setting time adjustability as well.",
        "not as good as stock sorry",

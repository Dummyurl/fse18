        "Working much better now on huawei watch now. Great design and one of my favorite ambient modes of all the watch faces I have. My only grow is Santa's arms blend into the back round to much. Maybe the option for a blue or green background in the future.",
        "Needs full color ambient mode! *Update* Full color Ambient mode has been added and I couldn't be happier! Would crash after update but I uninstalled and reinstall and it's working perfectly. Thanks for adding it! I have the LG G Watch R and always use full color ambient mode because I still get full day use and there is no option for this only b/w and that's just plain ugly. Please add full color and I have no problem with giving 5 stars.",

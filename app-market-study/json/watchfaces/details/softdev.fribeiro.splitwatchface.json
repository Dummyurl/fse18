        "Loved it! It's a beautiful example of the neo-impressionism/minimalism hybrid. Outstandingly handcrafted by the gentle touch of a professional digital watch maker. Uses a perfect blend of wizardly gradiented colours improved by the magic of a cunningly chosen font. I can't wait for the next watch face masterpiece. Keep at it!"

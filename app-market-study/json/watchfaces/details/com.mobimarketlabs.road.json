        "Pretty nice.  Running on Android 8 Oreo OS phone, and on Tag Heuer Connected 45 watch... Seems to work ok.  But, weather shows +72 / 3.1 ?   I assume that is 72 degrees, is 3.1 the wind speed?  Also, should some apps launch, like Fit, to see details when I press screen?",
        "Simple, very visible, sensible ambient mode, doesn't chew a lot battery, functional, very good for rectangular faces.",
        "I like it only problem is i have to force update weather every time or i would rate 5 stars",
        "Nice clean watch face useful information at a glance easy to see colors",
        "Best of the lot.",

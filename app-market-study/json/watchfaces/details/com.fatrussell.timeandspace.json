        "The tardis looks great",
        "Okay but Its okay but the issue i have is the time covers up where notifications show on the watch when its in standbys mode so your seeing white text over white text.  That's my only flaw.  I own a Hauwei Smart watch.    The tardis watchface looks bright and bold especially when in standbys mode.  I have yet to try the sonic screwdrivers yet but from what I see, I have a winner.",
        "One tiny flaw I love the Tardis opening to show different characters,  but sometimes it gets stuck and I can't get it to show the time!   Fix that and it would be perfect!",
        "Fun theme Nice detail, but peek cards cover up the date and part of the time.",
        "Ok Ok , but time covers up half the TARDIS.. and the screwdriver ones look a bit off center",
        "I like it, but I can't figure out how to change to 24-hour time. Will have to come back to this when that's working."

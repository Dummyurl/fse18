        "Just bought this watch face, I love the design and the personalization settings sync with my watch instantly. One disappointment is the fitness info are not working, HR & steps always showing 0. I want to keep this app, can support help to fix the issues? I'm using Ticwatch S powered by Android Wear 2.0.",
        "Just bought this I like it but why does the heart rate light on the back of my Huawei watch 2 stay on all the time??? Kills the battery!!?? If I take my watch off at night I have to turn it off?! Please sort it",
        "My favourite watch face at the moment. One star knocked off because the heart rate monitor complication doesn't work (always displays 0) with Wear 2.0 (on a Huawei W1). And yes, I have tried reinstalling.",
        "Liked this so at first but now heart rate doesn't show up.  Reinstalled app a few times stil doesn't work.   I would love to give this app 5 stars but since fitness is a huge reason you would buy the app... and it doesn't seam to be working in rating it lower.",
        "Good except the BPM doesn't work on LG G Watch. It gives me fake readings. I know this because the heart rate monitor does not come on and my table has a BPM of 56.",
        "My favourite watchface, only issue is 0bpm on the heart rate reading. I am connected to Google fit and I want my readings to come from fit rather than the face as I don't want my sensor to be active all the time."

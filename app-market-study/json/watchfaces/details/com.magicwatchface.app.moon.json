        "This watch face is beautiful to look at and is exactly what I was looking for. However, I wish it had settings either built into the watch face or as a separate app. There is no option for 12 hour time, any additional options or settings for shortcuts, and the weather information is inaccurate for my location and lacking Fahrenheit measurement."

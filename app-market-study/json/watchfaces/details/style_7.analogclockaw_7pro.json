        "Nice to pay real money for an app that won't OPEN. I was having trouble opening the free version of this app, so I figured that I'd probably have much better luck if I just got the Pro version, so I spent the money. Well, I've been waiting LITERALLY for 20+ minutes, and the app STILL won't open. At the start, it tells you to expect a 1 - 3 minute wait for the app to connect, which was fine if it ACTUALLY OPENED within that time-frame, but I'm STILL waiting & NOTHING. I might as well get my money back and wait for the app to open for free. Sorry.",

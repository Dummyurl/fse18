        "This app was completely inaccurate in step counting and in temp. Worse it acted viral by continually placing itself on my phones home screen.",
        "Awesome This is by far the best watch face I have ever used, but there are some things that need to be able to change. There should be a 12hour clock and the ability to reset steps because it looks odd past the hundreds. Add those and 5 stars all the way",
        "Good..but It is a cool app...but the developer should develop the ability to change the icons....I would rather have #of messages vs step count as an example...change this and it is 5 ☆",

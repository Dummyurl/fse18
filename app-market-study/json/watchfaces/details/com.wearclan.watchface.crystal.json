        "Has crashed a couple of times in the past. Hopefully is/will get more reliable as really like the way phone and watch battery needles 'fall' down to zero and very easy to read time. Only wish I could have the date on the same line as month and year as I can't read the small date circle with my old eyes ::-(",
        "Missing 12hr Display For us +300m Americans, it would be nice to have the 12hr display option. Also, periodically reports a crash dialogue box on my smartphone (why is the app running on my smartphone?). Beautiful design though, one of the best looking watch faces. Hope these issues get addressed!",
        "SO TIRED OF 17 FORCE CLOSES EACH DAY !!!!!!! Guys : I've notified you of this last month and you Still haven't fixed this. 1 Star until Fixed THEN am Easy 5 * watch face! I'm Sick and Tired of telling you this Multiple Times Each and Every day.",
        "Beautiful, but GOD THE CRASHES This watch face is great, would use it more often if it had a 12 hour option, but why oh God why does it need to crash every half hour, it's insane and really gets in the way of me trying to use my phone...",
        "Constantly stops working I have reported this app several times and there has been no fix to it. So, I uninstalled it. If it worked properly, it would be a nice watch face to have on my Nexus 6.",
        "Best watch face so far! This looks very beautiful and classy on my Sony smartwatch 3. Has worked well for me so far. Did get a couple of crash reports on my phone but when I looked at the watch face, it was still working fine."

        "Would be 5 stars if Vader were included. How you can have Kylo and not Vader is a head scratcher.  It's a good watch face for Star Wars fans with a few options. I agree background options would be nice. Luke, Obi-wan, and a crybaby that pretends to be a sith....tsk tsk",
        "Cool Great all except it would be nice to change the background color, you can barely see Kylo Ren because black is the only color. Even just a white background option would be nice.",

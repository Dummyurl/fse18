        "Concept is great Now it at least updates but most images are either partially or fully black and white.. there seems to be some problem with the code. When I run a power shell command in my windows PC the images are always in full colour.",
        "Location Based view!! I absolutely love the app but I would like it even more if I could see over Europe. I know the developer has said that it is using images from a particular satellite but I am hoping that there are other satellites taking similar pictures of other parts of the world that the developer can implement into the app.",
        "Great idea. As someone living in Europe, I would prefer the picture to lookout over Europe, so the day/night cycle matches my location.   I understand that the source of the picture is Asian, so there might not be location based pictures to fetch?  So in general, great product, as a feature request: Location based view of Earth!",
        "Black and white Incredibly cool idea, though every morning the images are in black and white and no a longer live image. Need to clear data and reset wallpaper to restore use",
        "Great idea but I don't like that I can't adjust which part of the earth it covers. I'm Uninstalling for now but would consider using again in the future if I could see my side of the earth.",
        "Love it Great app, highly recommend, images are high res and no performance difference."

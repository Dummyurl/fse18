        "Nice watch face",
        "Love the way this looked, & yes I remember this in my nightmares, but then again, what this is for only existed in our imaginations @the time. The \"smartwatch\" was a Star Trek communicator, or Dick Tracy watch not something actually feasible! My how far we've come! Sadly though, this doesn't work with Tizen.",
        "I only get network error for weather, it doesn't display anything else. I checked settings, app permission, gps and everything. Pretty upset it doesn't work  I have tried turning both devices off and back on, & yes I have internet connection.",
        "Very good watch face and looks exactly how I wanted it to, however the notification counter can be very slow to update, and it would be nice to have the option to disable it entirely",
        "If you're as old and Geeky as me you'll love this :)",
        "Lovely watch face, great idea. One issue I find on Moto 360 gen 2,when I go to change favorite watch faves in wear 2.0 the menu crashes, I have tested it by removing the app and it works fine when DOS watch is not installed.  Also the option to ronove the notification counter or turn it white with ambient mode would be nice.  Also the counter doesn't fit on the screen.  Plus an option to remove seconds in the main watch would be cool. I know I'm asking alot but just firing ideas."

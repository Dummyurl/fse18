Free for all - please rate / comment if you like it!BTW, shout-out to Dat for sharing how Word Clock looks on his awesome looking LG G Watch R!Also, note that word clocks generally don't have minute-level accuracy.  (This would require far too many words.)  This word clock works on a centered 5 minute interval.  So from 4:57:30 to 5:02:29 the clock will read \"IT IS FIVE O'CLOCK\".",

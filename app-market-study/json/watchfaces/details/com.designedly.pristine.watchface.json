        "Very clean, lightweight watch face. You get the basic features you need in a watch: time (with second hand) day and date, plus a smartwatch essential: its power level. Nice!",
        "Wish I could remove the logo It's a bit jagged on Moto 360 1st gen.",
        "Simply a basic watchface. Battery life is good. Would be easier to change colors in the Android Wear app, not on the watch. Also, color change is very subtle, pink is very close to Red.",
        "Nexus 5x SW3 ASUS Tab 7.0 Xperia Z Tab 3 Very nice thank you.",
        "Almost 5 star Would have been 5 without the logo....too bad"

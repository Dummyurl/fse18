    "description": "The application is a set of three Android Wear watch faces, suitable for both round and square display. By default it shows graphical display of day and night, and textual sunrise / sunset hours (not included in the 'Simple' watch face). This option may be turned off in the companion configuration settings. However, it's really nice to watch the day elongates while spring is upcoming.The day and night display is the internet connection independent. It bases on your location and the timezone settings, therefore it's not expected to work when you turn location services off. The sunrise and sunset time calculation depends on the SunriseSunsetLib library by Mike Reedell. CAUTION: Sunrise / sunset calculation may not work properly in all possible locations. If it happens to you, you may always turn it off. You have been warned. ;)In the 'Clear' watch face you can replace the seconds display with the last position and time, based on which the sunrise / sunset circle was drown (in the companion configuration app). It's not really useful on the daily base, but might come in handy when you suppose that the calculation is incorrect in your location / time zone.After installing the application wait about 30 seconds, and select the watch face either on your watch or in the companion application. You will not see the app in the app drawer.CAUTION: Please make sure whether you have Android Wear 5.0.1 installed on your watch. This application is not supposed to work on older OS versions.This application utilizes The Android Open Source Project code, (C) 2014 The Android Open Source Project, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

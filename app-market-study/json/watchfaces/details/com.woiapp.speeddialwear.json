        "Pretty good This is very useful when you don't have WiFi or mobile data signal for OK Google. Used in conjunction with Wear mini launcher it is very convenient. However, I would like an optimised version for round watch face (LG G watch R) - probably just requires slightly smaller icons! I'd also like to see the dialer as a right swipe action rather than at the end of the contacts! I was a bit surprised at the price, but I paid it so you got me. But otherwise just what I was looking for.",

        "So not reliable I so want this app to work... but on my Note 3 it hardly ever dials... making the app totally useless.",
        "Be patient and it's great!!! Love this dialer!  Please make more cool apps!!! Like a speed dial widget I can access from watch face with like 2 clicks... keep up the great work! !!",
        "Android wear speed dial Hasn't worked since the first day eveytime i dial it says connecting and never connects! I want a refund!!",
        "Images Don't Stay Set Images still dont allow editing(selecting), but dialing seems to be working now. Is there any way to make the Speed Dialer icon stay on your notification bar so that it can't be cleared and stop connection ?"

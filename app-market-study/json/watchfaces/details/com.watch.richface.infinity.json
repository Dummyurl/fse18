        "One of my fave watch faces for my LG Urban Mk1. Has everything you need, although the list of tiny 4squares at the bottom of the face which takes you to the main menu,  the little headphone to start the music app fails to do anything & plays nothing,  is really the only gripe I have with it all. Oh, & the little weather icon never changes to anything other than a half moon & doesn't give you accurate weather  'c' temperature.  Change these two gripes & I'll change to 5*",
        "Love this watch face! It has all the stuff I want, you can change the colors, and some other stuff that I really like having but it doesn't lag the watch like the custom face apps have. I have a couple issues that I would like to see get addressed but they don't effect the overall usability of this watch face.   1. The weather is set to update every hour or every half hour (I have tried both), and it works sometimes but then other times it won't update for like 12 hours, or until I manually go in and hit update. Then it seems to work again for a bit.  2. Changing the color from just tapping the time is a bit annoying. I would like to be able to tap on the weather and stop watch stuff but its so sensitive that I have to keep it \"locked\" which makes those buttons unusable.",
        "works pretty well,  updating weather is kind of hit or miss.  end up toggling back and forth on watch faces to get it to update",
        "It's okay. Didn't update for time zones when traveling without having to reset all the settings. Cycling through colors didn't save the custom color I set either.",
        "I like the look of the watch face,but the weather doesn't update on my zquart watch, contact the developer but look like there is no fix.",
        "Everything I want and it all works!"

        "Great app with a small issue. It works well except when you don't check in with the venues it gives you the first time.  If you don't check in and just back out of the app, those venues will be the only ones it will ever give you, no matter how far you move.  Please fix this issue.",
        "I like it Nice app. Glod job!",
        "Really great",
        "Good app. It is nice and simple application. But I would like to put an icon to my checkin. I hope this will happen in next releases.",
        "Nice UI. Could use a few features and fixes. First off, I recommend Swipify launcher instead of Wear Mini. However, any app launcher is highly recommended. It's great seeing apps take advantage of the new Foursquare (not just the Swarm side). It's too bad that the check in side keeps crashing. I would like to see the add-on on the phone side app to build in a setting to include Twitter and Facebook in the Swarm Check in. It is available on other Android Wear Apps. Overall, good job. Well thought out. +JoeKaton  Update: have seen the Beta side which solves the crash. Good work. I look forward to seeing the final and future updates."

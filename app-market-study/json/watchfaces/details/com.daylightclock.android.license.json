        "One of the neatest apps I've ever seen! The developer is responsive and the new features are fun. This is the only widget that stays on my home screen year after year!",
        "This is the one, of you need a 24 hour watch/clock widget for your home screen. It's great for reminding you how little daylight you have, in the winter. By default 12 is on top, which is the best design. You can switch it in the settings. You have to go to settings to make it read 0-24 instead of twice 1-12, around the dial.",
        "A beautiful way to follow the time in different parts of the world. The developer has always been extremely helpful and takes care of his customers. I've owned the app for many years now and I still love it from the day I bought it. A little masterpiece.",
        "Love this app. As a pilot I'm in need of knowing when sunrise and sunset is each day, plus this app is super fun to play with a the settings. Works fine on my nougat phone and lollipop tablet",
        "A cool clock which allows you to see the solar highlights of the day visually. Nice to also see that the clock feature has got a new beautiful design. I wish there was physical wall clocks like it."

        "Excellent watch face Just a few customizations away from a 5 star watch face. It could use a double/triple tap action short cut and maybe some colors options, but overall this is a very nice design. Update (4/12/16): 4.5 Stars! New colors are a welcome improvement and most of them work well on Zenwatch2's weird low bit ambient mode. Just need app shortcut and minimalistic battery meter to be Perfect!",
        "I love this watch face it's not a bad watch face and besides that it has big digits and I can actually read it since I am partially sighted it means I'm legally blind in one eye the only thing it doesn't have is the 12 or 24 hour time format because right now it's set to military time but I don't know how to get to the 12-hour time zone format that's right to 12 hour time format that is so anyway I just started enjoying it and I really love it so keep up the good work I made it does need some improvements if you know what I mean thanks again this is Leonard from Seattle",
        "Excellent watch face very easy to read the time would like to see watch battery and double tap for weather hour by hour and five day weather outlook can't find if there's a premium version hope so very soon as I will be using this watch face as my daily driver",
        "Great simplistic face. Would be awesome if it can add watchface complications on wear 2.0",
        "Very nice"

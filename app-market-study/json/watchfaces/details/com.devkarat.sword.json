        "Love the watch face but the numbers 11 and 12 are in the wrong place and there is no 10! Would happily give the app 5 stars if this could be rectified. Got it on Asus Zenwatch 2.",
        "I like the watch face. There is a problem with it not updating the phone battery percentage, even after a restart. Fix this and I will give 5 star.",
        "watch face is great looking & very functional. It keeps battery info for both phone and watch current, toggles between weather and steps, very easy to read. I love this app.  Even better, the developer was very responsive to questions I had about installation. I've Android Wear 2 on a Huawei watch.  I've been using the watch face for several days now and it really makes the Wear much more useful and valuable - highly recommended",
        "Problems with square version there's a few errors in the square version: the hours are in the wrong order( 8-9-12-11), the 6 is too small? Also noticed that the automatic refresh for the weather doesn't work at all.  Please fix",
        "On  the​ m600 the hours show \"12\" between 9 & 11.... Fix it and it gets 5* as it is it's just a bad joke",
        "It goes 9-12-11 on the square face and the batter of phone doesn't update if it's on charge"

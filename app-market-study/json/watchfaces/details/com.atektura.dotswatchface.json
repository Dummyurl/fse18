        "This is a really nice clean face design. I'd love it if the Dev would add some further complications. Maybe external app options to show at the top and bottom in the same style as the date and battery. Personally I'd like to have my polar flow exercise progress on there. Otherwise I love it, great looking clean face",
        "It's pretty good",
        "Great watchface Almost perfect.  When you swipe up and the notifications on the watch show the dots shrink but in a circle above the notification.  I wish all the colors acted the same as the black watch face. Where it looks seamless. Other than that amazing work!",
        "Very nice But I would like to have one more thing - the day of weeks and it would be excellent",
        "Great watch face Is it possible to switch the date with the battery?   The date is always on the right side of every watch,  except for this watch face.   Thanks!!!!!",
        "Would LOVE if you could remove the leadoff zero."

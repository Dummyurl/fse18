        "Great concept I love the app very simple and easy to use. Wish it had an ambient mode though for the watch and the picture would change when you activated the screen on the watch.",
        "Brilliant app Simple but great",
        "Awesome",
        "Works well but.. I love the concept of this but would it be possible to add some settings like change the language to English and use 12 hour rather than 24 hour? Add those settings and it is 5 stars....I mean when choosing the the pics and stuff, the language for add or delete pictures to be in English. I mean, we can figure it out but maybe an option for changing language there..yeah setting it as the default would be awesome and my phone is set for English US",
        "Almost perfect This watch face has so much potential. There just needs to be an option for 12 or 24 hour clock and the ability to to move the clock and change its size. Please don't forget this application!"

        "Ignore all negative reviews, true it doesn't show up at first and took longer than 5-10 minutes like some have said but trust me, I'm on wear 2.0 with a moto 360 & it did arrive after a few hours much to my delight   If you've gotten this far you did the graphic, so no need to talk about how great it is.",
        "Great looking watch face. No issues on my moto360. I do want to be able to change the time format from 24hrs to 12hrs. Also a date option would be nice. More settings other than the 3 colors. Dope tho",
        "At first doesnt show on phone...after 5-10 minutes shows up in your Adroid Wear Options with Blue, Pink and Green...  Love it!!!",
        "Not showing up after latest update OTA Doesn't show up in the watch face option even though it's installed.",
        "Looks great but The bape face does not appear on the watch or the android wear app?, help",
        "It's Ok. Needs to be able to let me change to 12-hr clock. Also, the seconds \"bar\" should be for battery level. At least give me the option to change it. Thx"

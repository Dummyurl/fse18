        "This application has never worked correctly ever since I installed it. The LiveTv feature has never worked for once. It's only showing channel 100, nothing else. How do I get this issue sorted out?  I wish I can attach screenshots so you understand better. This application needs total overhaul. What's the essence of the app when the end user ðŸ‘¤ can't use it conveniently?",
        "As for me it's working perfectly...... Only one thing now is if they will enable Internet subscription for this app it will be better... It consume my data so much I don't want to watch on low because the image is not clear",
        "This is so annoying! Online I can login, but the app just keeps saying my password is incorrect. What's the point of releasing an update that doesn't work? Before the update, it was perfect. We pay so much money for the premium package, plus perks & it doesn't work. C'mon Multichoice, get it together...",
        "Every time I have to uninstall and reinstall and am tired.  it's either I can't stream live TV or it keep telling me to check my playstore settings.  Like seriously???? Are you guys for real!",
        "Started out ok. Used for a while till it started acting up. Tells me I can't use it anymore coz my phone is not certified? I have a Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro. However when I check list of certified phones provided, Samsung is one of them. So I wonder if it's the particular phone or the app is faulty. And why was I able to use it initially on the same phone..",
        "The servers must be made of patatoe or something because it's always freezing up and often doesn't even start to stream. I use other streaming services . E.g. Sky Sports, Netflix Etc. And never have this problem."

        "GREAT CUSTOMER FAST SUPPORT.  Google PLAY is the one that is having issues.  This watch was beautiful until we got the SNOTE 8.  Now I cannot even reinstall it.  Hopefully Google PLAY will offer the same fantastic Richface support!!",
        "It's nice. Would be better if I could hide the clock hands since there's already digital time, and the watch hands get in the way of everything else like battery percentage.",
        "Now I wish I had read more about this before I purchased it, I didn't realize it was for android wear, I have a Gear S3 and it won't install onto my watch. Does the devoloper give refunds or can it work on my Gear S3?",
        "The free version is useless. Does not give any real idea of how the short cuts work.",
        "I bought the premium version and kind of regret it now. The free version was much cleaner without all those coloured icons messing up the look. Would be better if you could turn them off, hide them out at least turn them black and white. Also, there is not a step counter on the face, which is a pretty basic complication. That just boggles my mind.",
        "Nice face design, but the app is NOT very user friendly. It took me a while to work out I had to install the app on both my watch AND my phone to be able to customize anything. Then, the controls in the app are not self-explanatory - tool tips explaining each function would be helpful. Alternatively, a \"dummy\" watch face in the app could show the effect of changing a setting. It took ages for the settings I changed to sync to my watch, so much so that I couldn't work out what any of the functions did, because I had no visual feedback on what each change did. Also a bit disappointed that I can't view today's step count in one of the icon slots, only an icon that once you press it gives you the week's stats."

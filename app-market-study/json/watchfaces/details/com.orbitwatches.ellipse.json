        "One of the slickest watch faces Until an update screwed the alignment up on Moto 360. Three months later and still not fixed. Poor show.",
        "Has potential, Unfortunately on Moto 360 Gen 1, it seems to align with the bottom of the screen, not the top, which leaves a gap the same size as the amient light sensor at the top of the face. Not usable, but fixable guys...",
        "Beautiful This is probably the best looking analog face I've found for my G Watch. Only request I have for it is a day/date display. Otherwise it's almost perfect.",
        "Fix it! It's dropped off centre on Moto 360, is it so hard to fix?!",
        "Not round This watch face looks like a triangle in my moto 360. Please refund my money. Four days just pass, and I still didn't get a refund. I want my money back now please.",
        "Love it I really like this watch face - the 3D effect with the highlight and shadows looks terrific."

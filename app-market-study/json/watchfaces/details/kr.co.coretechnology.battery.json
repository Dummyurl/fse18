        "Solid app. Does what its supposed to do, just a little disappointed by the fact that any pictures set as the background are downscaled to where it can be hard to distinguish what it is. Used the same picture on the default wear 'custom' face and it shows up crystal clear. Hoping this can be improved with an update. Also having the ability to change the background with a gradient would be nice too.",
        "Clean and simple, but... I really enjoy how clean and modern this face looks, but I have 2 concerns that if addressed would make this a 5 star app. 1. If I have to pay 99 cent to change the colors then I would like a \"save color profile\" option. Then I could easily change from 1 preset to the other. 2. If I want the time, date, and stroke to be the exact same color, it's rather difficult to do so. It would be nice to have a \"recently used\" color option. If these issues are addressed I would gladly rate the app at 5 stars",
        "Favorite face for my moto 360 My only complaint is some cards block the date. If there was an option to raise the time and date up to clear the card, I wouldn't need to swipe the card down to see it.",
        "I've been looking for ages for a clean simple digital watchface for my Sony  Smartwatch 3...and at last have now found it with this app.  It's easy to set up and has lots of choices of colours and background.  There's an in-app purchase option for Premium but this is in fact a donation and the free version is the same as the Premium. I've donated anyway because it's a good well-designed app.  The only extra feature I'd like is the ability to change the font size of the time and date...especially the date. Some of us don't have 20-20 vision.",
        "Nice simplistic face Would love to be able to select colors by hex code (so they can be consistent), but even still, this is exactly what I was looking for.",
        "Exactly what I've been looking for. Was very happy to donate for premium, even without extra features, because I have been trying to find a simple, battery saving, but  color adjustable face, with 12 hour time and date, for quite a while."

        "Love it! One of my faves.   Love the digital look.   One slight weather sync issue,  it goes blank sometimes even with always connected and no optimization.",
        "One of the best! I really enjoy this watch face. I always find myself going back to using this one. It has a retro look and clean face. Works fine and is quick to display. No issues with notifications or apps. Android wear slide functions work fluidly. Great work! Makes the Android wear experience great.",
        "Preview card won't go opaque Moto 360 It's very hard to read notifications on this watch face since they won't go opaque in Moto 360. I've reported this issue to the developer, no fix was provided.",
        "Moto 360 1st gen One of my favorite faces now thanks to the battery improvement. I prefer the black and white mode.",
        "Very nice Can you provide an option from where can be choosen what element to be displayed in ambient mode?"

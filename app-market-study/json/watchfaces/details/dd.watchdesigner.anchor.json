        "PERFECT; Except no gray ambient mode. That would EASILY make it the greatest watchface on the entire store.",

        "Like My current favourite watch face thanks",
        "Whoa Whoa",
        "5 stars means no complaints It's one of the sharpest watch faces I've come across, why can't they all look this good (hate seeing pixels). Literally have no complaints, I'll happily pay for more quality watch faces like this one."

        "Great face! Excellent to look at and fantastic battery consumption! Highly recommended",
        "Great Face Don't like the bird... but still give it 5 stars",
        "Love it",
        "Nice and Original but... It doesn't load the weather app and it says it can't find the flashlight app. Once you go into the alarm there's no swiping that will get you out of it (thank goodness my watch has a hardware button). The app shortcut icons are VERY small and difficult to accurately press. It also took me a while to figure out what they were because they are so small. Sorry, had to refund it."

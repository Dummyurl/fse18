        "Aww Got all excited when the update came out. I thought it was finally getting customizations! Still a great face though! And maybe a different ambient mode! This is still one of my favorites though, and I think it shows the potential of a smart watch screen vs. a regular watch.",
        "Simple and Elegant Great looking watch face that is easy to read and matches many outfit styles. I have yet to run into any problems with this watch face! Can't wait for customization to come out soon!",
        "Simple enough I didn't buy a smart-watch to have it imitate a conventional watch, and this nails it. More features would be nice but I'm not sure how that could be done without detracting from the overall esthetic.",
        "Dislike it Good watchface with exemplary permissions (none) and nice clean design, but no weather info, can't disable ambient mode or make it look like normal, can't hide peek cards in ambient mode, can't vibrate hourly, and poor support (\"customizations\" have been \"coming soon\" for 1+ years...).",
        "Has potential but it appears the developer has abandoned this app. Brilliant design and a shame they gave up on it. Only thing I'd like to see is a day /date and would gladly pay for this app. Shame is abandonware",
        "No sleep mode? Nice looking app but it looks like it doesn't have a sleep mode or it is not working on my Fossil Q Founder. I see the watch face dim for a few hundred milliseconds then go back to the same image. There doesn't seem to be a low power mode like all other watch faces I've used. Is this expected behavior? I'm concerned using this face will hurt my battery life but I haven't been using the watch face long enough to know... Thank you"

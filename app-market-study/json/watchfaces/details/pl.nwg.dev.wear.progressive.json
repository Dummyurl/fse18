        "*Fixed* Needs better fit on round watches Looks fairly easy to make an option for round watches to slightly compress the top and bottom scaling to fit full scales that are not cut off, otherwise fairly good. Another method is to use continuous strips for the scales that move towards a centerline.",
        "This watch face crashed everytime I tried to use it on my ZenWatch 3, which was many tries over several weeks. Apparently it's been abandoned as it hasn't been updated in nearly two years.",
        "Great concept Maybe some ambient options would be nice. Otherwise, I really like this face. Looks great on my G Watch R.",
        "Interesting Unique concept, just wish there was an option to choose between 12 and 24 hour time."

        "I really want this watch face to be my go to & it would if syncing with Google Calendar only worked. I am a medical student and live by that calendar. I wanted this watch face with the portrayed daily breakdown of several activities on screen at a time. Alas after way too much time messing with settings. It just doesn't work. Thus the face was a waste of time and other precious resources for me.   Other faces sync with Google Calendar just fine. Please fix this, or give a tutorial, and I will gladly increase my review.",
        "Watch is a good concept. But it just does not work. The calanders don't work, the temperature is some three digit number that doesn't make sense, the step counter is way off(just use the Google fit data). I emailed dev about some questions and never heard back. I have the Nixon mission that is listed as a supported watch.",
        "Doesn't work on Huawei W1 The face appears to install correctly but isn't visible in the list of available watch faces in Android Wear. No response from developer after two weeks, hence one star.",
        "A watch face with almost everything the only thing it's missing is a dialer and if the Dev put that feature on, it would be the perfect watch face so much information  and customisation 👍👌",
        "The weather temperature is 3 digit which need to correct by the developer,I hope as soon as possible, plus text is too small to read, otherwise it's fine",
        "This is my \"go to\" watch Face."

        "Very slik design. The date in the complications doesn't keep up but fixed it by using a 3rd party app to fill in the correct date (androidwear  clock).",
        "Date complication doesn't update on new day. Have to switch faces then switch back to get correct date.",
        "App crashes on Huawei watch. Date complication doesn't work, and 3rd party complications don't show.",
        "Liked it a lot, only problem is widgets/dials are a little dark compared to the rest of the watch. Minimal ambient looks nice",

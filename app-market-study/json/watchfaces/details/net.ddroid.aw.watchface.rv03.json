        "Very nice design! I like the design and functionality. But the only 2 things I would like you to add is: 1. A step counter display. (Enable/Disable in settings). 2. Screen timeout to ambient mode timeout. (Ex. Default, 3 seconds, 5 seconds, 8 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds).  If you are able to add these features I will re-rate as a 5 star app. Thanks, I do like to support developers!"

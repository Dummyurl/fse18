        "I was pretty close to requesting a refund, but found that the phone app allowed the customization of the different superheroes. I was trying to do it solely from the watch on the Fossil Q Founder 2. Once I figured it out, I love it! Good purchase :)",
        "I am giving this app one star, not because I hate it, because I only have access to the Batman face. There seems to be no way to change the superhero.  I have the Fossil Q Marshal.....help or suggestions would be appreciated.",
        "Haven't been able to use the other wallpapers other than batman for a long time now. Even across different watches (moto 360 2nd gen, Asus zenwatch 3, Fossil Q Explorist)",
        "I have android wear app on iPhone and a Nixon Mission watch and all i get is the one watch face which is Batman. I mean this is a cool watch face but i want the other ones also and if i am paying $2.89 for it you would expect to be told if it does not work going through and apple device. Thanks",
        "Why am I not able to change watch face on my Moto 360 Sports 2nd Gen. I tried to restart my watch, but got no luck. Am uninstalling this app.",
        "Please add battery indicator option. It will be perfect!!"

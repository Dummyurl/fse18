        "Not sure what it does? Just sits there.nothing fancy like showing up when I darken my phone. Hope nobody paid for this.",
        "Advice: Add a smooth moving seconds hand in next update.  Rest the app is awesome!!",
        "Won't sync to watch.",
        "It's elegant and perfect and simple and.... Can't describe it enough...just that I love it. One question can you update the time to 12 hours for digital? Also I noticed a glitch...sometimes the hands are an hour behind",
        "Beautiful Such a simple yet gorgeous watch face. I love it!!"

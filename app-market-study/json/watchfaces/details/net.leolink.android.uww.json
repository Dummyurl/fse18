        "It never gives me the option to send to my phone. Everything is connected, but the app never progresses past the creation stage. I've emailed for a fix twice with no response. I would love to use this app, but I can't.",
        "I like the app.  It is easy to add any picture as the background.  One minor issue/request.  Most of my pictures are of landscapes and have the sky at the top of the image.  It would be nice to be able to move where the time is located.  For most of my pictures I would like the time to be at the top of the watch.  Thanks.",
        "Easily the best watch face I've had. I could nitpick about a few other things it could have, but given we're given a choice of pics, time, date & weather for FREE. I'll save the nitpicking. Great job",
        "Great, but... More options would make this the best watchface ever! A step counter widget and actually make the icons widgets so I can hit the weather and go to the app or hit the calendar and go to Agenda!",
        "Nice with problems It works nice, however it does not keep the flat tire look in mind. It will stretch the image to fit on the screen instead of cutting the lower edge off.",
        "Deleted my other photo watchface This. Is. Awesome!!! So far, so good. I deleted my other two watchface that used my images as a wallpaper since this one has everything I need: time, date, batt... weather is a plus. Pretty happy with this watchface and the customizable font is just icing on the cake. Thank you!"

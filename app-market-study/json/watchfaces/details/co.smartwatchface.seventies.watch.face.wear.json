        "Burn In Issues Great, absolutely love the watch face however am having burn in issues after only two hours of always on mode in ambient on a LG G Watch Urbane. Will not use for the moment until whites in ambient have been resolved..",
        "Funkalicious Makes me want to go all John Travolta Saturday Night Fever every time I look at it! Let's get down & get funky!  Nice watch face & great read ability.",
        "The best watchface for square watches No other watch face looks as good as this one on square watches. The dull orange color matches the band of the asus zenwatch perfectly!",
        "Best watch face so far Tried lots of different faces but always come back to this one. I actually prefer the ambient mode face than the full on face. Maybe offer that as a separate face?",
        "It's not perfect... There's no battery meter or weather but I just like it. I think it's the ambient mode.",
        "Very good None of the hideous hand jump when the screen turns on the Moto 360 unlike other faces. Battery usage acceptable too"

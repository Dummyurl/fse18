        "Use to be my favorite face. Now it just crashes all the time on both my watches. The option to change the color circle has also stopped working on both watches. It let's me change it in settings but never actually applies it.",
        "Needs a battery icon. Weather also not right Would give five stars if it had a battery icon like most other watch faces do! Also agree with others that the weather is not correct",
        "So far so good üòâ If possible would be nice to add some radar blips on the screen,  just simple dots signifying submarines boats etc.  Other wise is perfect üëå.",
        "the watch face its self is very nice.. but.. the temperature always says 20¬∞ and never changes and it also doesnt give you options to add battery health... if you could do those basic things on it i would of loved it..",
        "App Keep stops... Cool app, but every couple of weeks I have to remove the app and re install, because stops working.",
        "Beautiful, my favorite! Hope it gets a 2.0 update as using other  complications would fix the couple issues and make it perfect!"

        "Would like to have a LOT more customization, compared to some of your other watch faces you can't do anything to this. I'd like to be able to change colors or have themes plus be able to do things like remove the digital temperature and analog 24hour clock to reduce redundancy and make everything in the center a bit bigger. However I bought this knowing it did none of this, so even if you released a different one I'd buy it.",

        "Looks great on LG Urbane! This watch face looks great in both active & in the colour ambient mode.  Also, it's a real head turner."

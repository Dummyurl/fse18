        "Easily the best watch face I have. Just needs a little more customisation. The same as my other review really. A beautiful piece of art. Would just love to be able to change the ambient screen though.",
        "I just don't like it , and I would like a refund there isn't an option for refund!",
        "Loved it Simply awesome",
        "Looks great but needs 12 hour option. EDIT : Quick response from the dev with added 12hour support. Awesome watch face",
        "How do you enable 12 hour mode?",
        "Spacey Very cool and unique watch face. Very minimal design but very easy on the eyes. Just wish it had weather and phone battery level and lose the step counter. Maybe add the option to add those read outs or remove them. Overall nice face! üëç"

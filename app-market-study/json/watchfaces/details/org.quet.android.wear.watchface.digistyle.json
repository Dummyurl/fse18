        "Beautiful watch face, broken date display This watchface looks great and performs fantastically. Battery usage is light and there are a ton of customization options. However the date doesn't update until I turn it off and then back on in the options menu every day. 3 stars until fixed.",
        "Just what i wanted This app is all i ever wanted. I really am surprised that there are not more like it around. I am able to customize everything just right and the digital glitch animations look really cool.",
        "I have no idea what some of these system UI settings are. Status bar gravity? Protect hotword? Card progress mode? Are these documented someplace?",
        "Thanks for this Well worth the money, been looking for this for ages... looks amazing in black. Thanks again you nailed it :)",
        "Awesome Love the animation. Any chance of a less manic battery indicator?",
        "Very awesome and simple with lots of customization!"

        "Added tap event to force the glitch and/or randomize colors.",
        "Fixed minor bugs.",
        "Improved performances.",
        "Improved glitch effect.",

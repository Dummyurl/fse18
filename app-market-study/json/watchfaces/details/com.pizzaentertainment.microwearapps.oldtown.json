        "it is not showing up even after rebooting my watch and phone. I see the app has been installed. What am I doing wrong?",
        "Looks nice but no matter what colour you make the face it goes black and white in standby mode which is very disappointing. Not many options, for a paid app would expect day/date at least.",
        "Nice, simple watchface This is a nice, simple analog face. It hints at  time long past. It would be nice to have a second hand to complete the look though.",
        "My favorite so far Gorgeous,  love it",
        "Nice, BUT.. It looks stunning on the moto360, but i refunded because it needs a seconds hand!"

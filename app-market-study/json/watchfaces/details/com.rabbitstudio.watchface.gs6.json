        "Nice design, Weird implementation Nice design, I like the watch face. But please make it like a normal watch face. It does not need a separate app nor should it appear as two entirely separate faces. Just make one w/ settings for color...",
        "Good But ....... Lacks any type of customization (MULTIPLE COLOR OPTION). The Color option should be easy but please consider different Fonts and optional DAY/DATE! Thanks!",
        "It's nice but like be able to customize it. Like battery level would be great.Now Just have to guess or my watch dies cause can't keep looking at my phone at work just see if battery life is well or not",
        "MORE COLORS! üëç Please make more color options. I want to see a pitch black background with white words, or a white background with the same vice versa. Or red! Please add these colors and I'll make it a 5!",

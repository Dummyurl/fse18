        "Quality app. Coming from Watchmaker I was disappointed I couldn't add graphics but it is a  far superior app to Watchmaker. More reliable and not buggy. Very easy to make a slick looking, quality, information based watch face. Can assign the new wear complications (Facer can't). The editor is easy to use and fairly intuitive. Pujie is my new favorite!",
        "Very buggy on my phone, often edit menus stop opening or the app just opens to a black screen. Clearing data fixes it (make sure to save faces as you go). Once it does stay good, it's fantastic for customising!",
        "overall very nice app. Do not like it needs to stay running in order for steps,weather to update. step info only syncs from google fit rather getting directly from watch sensor like the default watch faces. the app also now makes permanent bluetooth connection, unlike the \"fake\" connect on default which i can still connect to car audio.",
        "Easy watch face creation. Worth every penny! I made exactly what I wanted in 2 minutes. Pujie has everything I was looking for. Beautiful templates and presets that let you customize everything. I tried several other watch face apps with in-app purchases that were too complicated and too expensive.",
        "After \"One moment please\" my note 8 just stays on a black screen. This happens whenever I reopen the app. I have to always delete the data in settings for it to start again. I was able to make a watchface I like but can't edit it because of this bug.",
        "I have purchased the app on my phone, I still need to purchase on my watch again?? Whenever I try to download on my watch it asks me to pay! can't get it work at all! What's wrong?"

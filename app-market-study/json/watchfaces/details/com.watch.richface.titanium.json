        "Titanium rich watch face I have a motorola 360, and this watch face is very attractive, but it does not work .  The two rectangles at bottom are always empty. I have many of the other Rich watch faces and they work just fine.",
        "Its good but... The watch face is very attractive no doubt, but give some more functionality like time zone option for LCD panel, its very helpful for a guy like me who travels a lot. Hoping to see it in next update.",
        "Marcin Doesn't work on Motorola moto 360 2nd. Wasting time and money.",
        "Come on... , why you not update it to support android wear 2? I have waiting to long time",
        "Great Watch Face.  Using it for a while now. Please add a \"square\" ambient mode,  then it would be perfect.",
        "Good If this watch face had square ambient mode I would love it."

        "Doesn't show sunset/sunrise/weather info in huawei watch",
        "Its gr8 but This face looks outstanding but needs to hold latest info when the watch disconnects from the phone. Still pretty awesome",
        "Great design, needs improvement I really like the design, however the weather information dissapears when not connected to rhe phone. Other watchfaces with such functionality still display the information, however it is not updated. Probably this is also the reason behind the higher battery drain. Please consider changing it."

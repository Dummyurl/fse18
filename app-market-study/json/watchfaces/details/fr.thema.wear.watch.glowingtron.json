        "Shattered expectations!!! I didn't expect much especially such a fantastic battery life! This watch face looks great and very much complements off the frame of the LG urbane. Great coloring options with endless color selection on the phone app. It's also a nice touch that there are simple pre set colors that are adjusted off of the watch. Great work!!",
        "Terrific Watch Face! Brings so much color and style to my watch face on my new LG Urbane. Just found this app and it is really great!Thanks for such a different kind of watchface. Question -What do the 2 numbers on the watchface represent? Thanks again!!",
        "Definitely showing promise! Finally working on LG G watch, my favorite watch face now. Need to be able to adjust the digital time size and switch to 12 hour time (from the watch itself) and this'll be a 5 star face for sure. Thanks to the dev for this one.",
        "I little disappointed The time is stuck on 24 hour mode with no apparent way to fix it.",
        "Very Good Watch Face but... I love this watch face. It looks really great on my Android Wear watch. But please include an option where I can change the font. Thanks in advance"

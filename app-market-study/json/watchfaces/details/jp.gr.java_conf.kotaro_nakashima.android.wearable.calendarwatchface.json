        "It would be awesome to have the weather, phone battery, and steps on it. But it is a good app. I only get one of my scheduled things when I have like three or four at different times. It would be helpful if it could show them. Needs a update",
        "My go-to This is my go-to WatchFace; it's really nicely designed and I really like the way appointments appear around the side.  However, there are a lot of problems with it too - it crashes. A lot. I'd say I have it working on 4 days of 7 a week. It doesn't show all day events. I wish it did. And you can't customise it at all - settings is a blank page. That aside there's still so much to recommend here, but make sure you have a 2nd choice face in mind too. You'll need it.",
        "Great but needs more options. It works well, but I would like a dark theme and the ability to choose different hands",
        "Does what it claims. You can select which calendars show up. Wish it would allow a toggle to filter full day events or/and those longer than 6/8 hours",
        "The watch face configuration screen does not work. Has been broken for months now. Apparently no developer support at all on this one.",
        "Does not work Setting via android wear app are blank."

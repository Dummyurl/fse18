        "Love design...needs fine tuning android wear app states there is a settings app available for this face but just brings back to face download...a settings app is a great idea for all watch faces! Time out settings, date, etc...",
        "Poor battery life Uses 27% of battery,, according to Battery Mix. Had to put watch on the charger twice today. Attractive design.",
        "Awesome look And I'd pay to get customization options.",
        "Love it!!! It was my fav watch face. I had to return my Moto 360 and I got Asus Zenwatch instead. Any chance of a square version of this for my new watch? Would love to use it again."

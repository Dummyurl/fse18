        "Moto360 Sport Looks Great As a pilot and gadget nerd, these hit the spot.  Simple and look great on my wear.  Toughest part of owning these faces is which one to use.             Note to the developers, on the altimeter watchface, make the colesman window be the date to add a little function too!",
        "Pixelated I thought this would be ideal for wear on a Moto 360, but once it was installed,  the watch gave looked nothing more than an enlarged image.  The screen itself isn't huge,  so I'm wondering why a smaller image file would be used.  It had potential.",
        "Awesome app! I have installed several other apps from this developer and the quality of this one is no different. Great work!",
        "Great app Works great, dev very responsive, perfect for me!",
        "Watch faces don't \"fit\" moto 360 Yeah, its a minor gripe, but with the airspeed indicator, it's pretty apparent, as the green arc is chopped off"

        "Update It showed up after two reinstalls. Persist if you're having this issue because the watch face is very nice. Thanks to the dev for his swift reply and offer of help. It's appreciated.",
        "Awesomely executed! Timely is one of the best looking apps out there and i havet been on the hunt for a watchface with the timely look since i got my 360. Really great job herr! Personally I'd like to see some features like bigger fonts and being able to see Phone battery status as well as watch battery. Weather would be cool too! Maybe even an analog clock option similar to the Timer/stopwatch feature in the timely app? Anyways, Really liking this and I am looking forward to future updates!",
        "Beautiful Absolutely beautiful faces just wish that we could make the time and date larger, it is too small for my eyes ;) Looking forward to this being in an update soon. If you are considering adding weather etc please make it optional as I reall would love to keep just the time and date. Thank you.",
        "Beautiful Absolutely love how this face looks. It would be even better if you could match the number size to the Moto 360's stock digital face for easier at a glance viewing. Off to a great start, and I can't wait to see how you improve it.",
        "Great interaction with dev Dev was quick to respond to my concerns. Really nice animations on this face I haven't found anywhere else. Very excited for custom presets.",
        "!!! If you could add a phase beam theme, matching the colors from the live wallpaper that used to come on nexus devices I would be so excited :D also an option to remove the tiny bubbles coming from the bottom would be great"

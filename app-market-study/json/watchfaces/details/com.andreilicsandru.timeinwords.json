        "Loving it, but.. Looks great :) good to see things fixed and working again! Im extremely satisfied with the dev talking to me and communicating with its users! Problems im experiencing right now: opening calender (left) crashes the face. And the weather (right) resets the location and will not hold a set location! Again, happy the dev is constantly looking to better the face and im sure it will be fixed soon!",
        "Great application. Love it. Nice touch with the German language.  You might think of improving the colors and fonts settings, because they currently are very counter-intuitive.  Also, there appears to be a bug setting the \"enable ambient color\". It does not automatically update the ambient color for letters after the color for letters in active mode was changed.",
        "Amazing but... Amazing app best thing I could have ever asked for! Sadly the calendar on the left caused the face to crash, then pressing it a second time causes the face to completely reset the weather and switch to the factor face. I am using a Asus ZenWatch 3. Please fix! Thank you :)",
        "Hi, great watch face! Your new update keeps crashing on my Moto 360 though. Anyway of going back to the previous version? I preferred the layout and time display also. Thanks.",
        "Great Bravo!!! But it has a problem, at least on Sony sw3. Everytime I go to its settings the weather location is changing back to Bucharest. For those with the calendar problem, you have an app that is drawing over the apps (wear mini launcher for example). Disable it set the permissions for the watch face and then reinstall / enable the other app. This is a bug I think from the OS. It happens on other apps as well.",
        "Calendar crashes Doesn't ask to get calendar permission, just crashes when you left tap. Changing weather location is also not working."

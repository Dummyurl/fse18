The time is represented by colourful circles around the screen.They represent, from outside to inside:- seconds  (red)- minutes   (orange)- hours       (yellow)- days in week     (green)- days in month   (light blue)- days in year      (dark blue)In ambient mode, the circles show up in white, and the second 'hand' is not visible.This is a unique and attractive watch face which demonstrates how the digital screen allows creative representations of time.Suitable for both round and square devices. For Moto360 users: the 'flat tire' at the bottom of the display doesn't hinder your ability to read the time. I developed this face using a Moto360 :)",

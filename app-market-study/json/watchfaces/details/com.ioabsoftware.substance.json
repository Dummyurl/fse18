    "description": "Substance is a watch face designed to look clean, simple, and provide you with the essentials - the time (of course), today's date, and both the watch's and the phone's battery percentage.With an unobtrusive second indicator 'pulse' in interactive mode (which really can't be done justice in screenshots, see how it looks in person) and a background color that changes with the time, Substance doesn't have any major frills or sparkly bits. It doesn't distract you with fake screen glare, confuse you with 4 different analog clocks all going at once, or overwhelm you with more information than anyone would ever need on their wrist at a glance. Give Substance a try and you'll quickly see how simplicity and a smart, clean design can beat out an over-designed, overwhelming watch, every time.Exo and Orbitron fonts used under SIL Open Font License:http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Exohttp://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/OrbitronAndroid Wear Flat Device Frame used under Creative Commons License:http://cyrilmottier.com/2014/07/31/android-wear-flat-device-frame/",

    "description": "CAPACITOR is a modern digital and analog watch face for Android Wear. This portable flux capacitor was made when i came back from the future and couldn't find where the Delorean was parked. This watch face can be hard to tell time on but its the only one that makes you time travel ...if you can run 88 Mph of course.A shortcut to customization options is accessible by long pressing the watch face, or directly from the Android Wear app. Accessing the settings from the watch directly is quite nice, but please note that its far better to access those settings from the phone. Yep from the Android Wear app, when you select a watch face you see a little cog icon on the watch face to access its settings. This is much better since a lot of options are only found there and not on the watch directly.Can't change colors? Well, you can't change colors for as long as the \"reset all colors\" option is ticked. Make sure its unticked before you start going all picasso on the watch.Compatible with Moto360, LG G Watch R, LG G Watch, Samsung Gear Live, Sony Smartwatch 3 & Asus ZenWatch, and basically every watch using android wear.Take note: Sometime there's a delay getting the watch face on the watch from your phone, i recommend a bit of patience if its not instantaneous for you .

        "I'm updating my review because I am now able to change all the color on the watch face and they show up on my Moto 360. Everything is working great except Logo Label is no longer showing any text, not even the default message. It's just a blank bar. Since this feature is not very important to me I have just turned the Logo Label off in the settings. I'm enjoying the watch face very much.",
        "LG Urbane 2 LTE Love it like all your other ones, but I noticed that the digital clock text is smaller than it should be on the LG Urbane 2 LTE. I suspected this with NAVI, but it is very obvious on this watch face. I have tried tweaking the font settings, but that only affects the card text. I hope that something can be done. I am looking forward to showing this off at the 3rd annual Time Lord Party, lol",

        "Excellent This is an epic looking version of REMARKABLE! I've pretty much decided that you are incapable of making a poor quality product. Excellent work!",
        "Doc Brown would be proud I own a few of Tha Phlash's watch faces and several other premium watch faces Hands down his are the best and most dynamic looking. They take a smart watch and make it a classic yet contemporary time piece. Doc Brown would be proud Homie.",
        "Yet another homerun! Can u do anything wrong? Keep the imagination flowing!"

        "Nice Watch face but I can't able to change the color of watch face it's only with black dial...I'm using Fossil Q watch. No setting option ..and second is please give more options of watch face it's just one ....",
        "Nice, but I can't use it as a daily face It's alright, but while the face is lit - it flicks through the rotation over a minute at about 2 fps, it would be nice if it was smoother and more so if I could have the option to have it rotate round the world over the course of an hour or day, rather than just a minute.",
        "One of my favourite watch faces hands down. However, since the recent update it flickers on my Huawei watch 2. Annoying enough to keep me from using it as my daily watch face",
        "Hi, this watch face isn't showing up on my android wear app or my fossil q founder. Please let me know how to fix.",
        "Beautiful Now also perfect on my Zenwatch! I love the colour changes. Thank you!",
        "Love this face! The only thing I would change is to add a 12 hour option!"

        "Great app. However cannot get the photo background  to work. Which was the main reason for the upgrade. Any tips for this function?",
        "What's up with this IAP trend with watch faces? I would have bought a handful by now if I could actually try the features first, smh. I won't pay a non-refundable IAP just to find out that one feature I wanted sucks. I won't steal and use cracked apps like a loser so I guess I'll just complain ðŸ˜‰",
        "Really like it. Only issues I've had are setting a photo as the background doesn't seem to work for me and I always have to sync from my phone before premium settings are available on watch. I'm using Fossil Q Explorist.",
        "Samsung Galaxy Note 8 married to Sony Smartwatch 3. Try as I might I could not get this watchface to come up on my watch, despite all permissions being granted.",
        "I really like this watchface...it has all the data I want in a face...my only issue is the placement of the unread notification, in it's current location it covers the watch/phone battery...if there's a way to fix the placement it would be worth five stars",
        "Great looking watchface with lots of customization. it can fit lots of information, and yet maintaining a cool and clean design. The premium worth the price."

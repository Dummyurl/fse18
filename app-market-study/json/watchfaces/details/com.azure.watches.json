        "Missing option, damages screen Beautiful layout, simple design, everything seems perfect. I just wish there was a way to have the ambient mode clock be different from the awak mode. I would love to have a digital watch face with the analog mode around the edge (as it is now), but when the watch goes to ambient mode have the choice to make it an analog clock instead of a digital readout. The other issue is that this face causes burn-in when ambient mode is active on an O-LED screen. There needs to be an ambient mode with thinner lines...",

        "Looks really good Only giving 4 starts though because the logo is a bit too big, takes up too much space, so maybe take out the developer's name, especially because the use of the font lobster also takes away from the polish of it as a whole.",
        "Found buggy! When watch goes in dim/ambient mode, time shows 1 min less than what it was showing in normal mode. Serious bug. Found that minutes needle moves back 1 minute when mode changes.",
        "Swiss-style watchface Great-looking watchface that looks like the classic Swiss clockface design.  Day and date are a little bit small on my Zenwatch, but not unreadable.  Awesome deal since it's free!",
        "Best watch face My favorite moto 360 watch face, and best of all it's free!... Thanks very much devs!!",
        "After installed this app, It was hidden and I can not open it. So I uninstall this app. BELL RINGING.",

        "Happy Halloween! Great watchface highly recommend for the month of October and beyond",
        "Perfect Watch Face This dev makes great watch faces. I have a few.  I like them all. 5 stars. I am a visually impaired guy. I asked the dev if he could do an update with a more readable font.  Within a few hours not only did he answer my email but he did the update. THANK YOU VERY MUCH",
        "Always on ambient mode? Would really like to see this with same color display in ambient mode (but dimmed) for those of us with bigger batteries",
        "Amazing watch face I loved the watch face! Some pumpkins seem like they have less resolution, either way it still looks amazing!"

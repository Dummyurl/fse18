        "Severely disappointed in their decision to remove the classes. I signed up for the year membership only for the classes and now I have an app that offers nothing. They need to at least have the classes up longer and give us more that 12 days notice before it's taken down. I will look to another company that won't take such an unfavorable action towards the community.",
        "Hey developers! I'm experiencing some problems while uploading an image on my Xiaomi redmi note 3pro, 1st time it's always failing, 2nd try is fine but removing all of the hashtags. In overall the app is a great tool. Thank you.",
        "The app is extremely buggy and does not refresh. Sends notifications about comments and likes but doesn't display the photos or the comments. App needs a lot of work to match the functionality of IG. I hope they get this fixed because I'd like a more professional photo platform with better picture quality than IG refuses to offer.",
        "Notifications don't seem to work very properly. I see 6 ppl liked my pic, and on notification it stands only 3. Notifications should update better",
        "Offers some nice images, but ability to share from apps like Lightroom mobile now seems to be broken. Seems to be getting worse with each update.",
        "Great place to share your photos and also see some great photos others post...its a good clean app."

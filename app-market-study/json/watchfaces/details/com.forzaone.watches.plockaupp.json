        "It's a wonderul design and this face goes well with elegant smart watches. I just have one objection: there are seven small gradations between the main numbers, and there should be only four. That's why I rate it with 4 stars. If you can correct this issue I will give 5 stars.",
        "The watch looks amazing I'm updating my review for this watch face and I have to say that I like it. Developers fixed my last problem and it works perfectly now. I do recommend this watch face for anyone who likes the classic look.     I downloaded this app expecting to get what it's pictured but to no success I wasn't able  to do it. The seconds arm never appeared on my LG urbane (by the way it's not the LTE version) I tried uninstalling and re-installing the app restarting my phone and watch and syncing the apps but no luck.",
        "Looks great but crashes my moto 360 I love the watchface especially in gold its very high res and looks amazing but it crashes my moto 360 at least once a day and forces me to hard reset the watch. I'd love to give it 5 stars if you are able to fix it or know what the problem is and could tell me. Thanks.",
        "good thx u dev for the update no more battery drain , everything's good now",
        "There's 7 small dashes instead of 4 in between each hash. Fix that and this gets 5 stars",
        "Looks good I like the fact you can change the watch face colour with one tap"

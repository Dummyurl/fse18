        "Thank you for the fix! 5 stars if google calendar colors could be preserved for respective calendars.",
        "If the digital watch face didn't crash I'd happily bump up the stars (maybe 5 stars).  I'm not an analogue face user, found another similar all to this that works fine with the digital face.  Would like the option for a pitch black background.",
        "Digital mode makes the watch face crash. Also it would be nice to have support for showing calendar appointments as their calendar colour.",
        "Not bad I've been messing with this app for a little while and I don't know why, but the event I had in my calendar before intalling did not get added to the screen. This event was added through an online link, so I dont know if that is why it wasn't shown on the watch screen or if it was because it was in my calendar before I installed this watch face. I will have to figure that out in a couple of days. I did add some test events however and those did show up on my watch face.",
        "Great Really good, would love more settings though. Like be able to create a circle to the left and right , to display weather and maybe battery.. Also, be able to show the date in ambient mode would be great. Maybe even show the text in the calendar events also in ambient mode. And a stopwatch feature. Than it would be perfect .",
        "Figured it out Okay, but not spectacular."

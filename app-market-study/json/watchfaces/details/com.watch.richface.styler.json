        "Reasonable Does what it says. Unfortunately the phone preview does not accurately represent what you get on the watch (placement of date for example: position and font don't carry over properly). Would like more date options (date only, date in a box). I am sure this will get better though!",
        "One missing feature for me PLEASE please add the ability to search for terms in the shared watch face section. If I want a \"ferrari\" watch face, it'd be MUCH faster to search for it then scroll through thousands. GREAT app otherwise. I love the customization capabilities and it usually has very accurate watch faces that update flawlessly.",
        "I've had this app for 3 minutes Much more customizable than I anticipated üòä Apple, if you're reading this, maybe you should let the owners of your products customize their devices.  I think you'd be jealous of what I made.",
        "Really Cool App! I really love this app. I use this for my Moto 360. Very customizable and easy to use. It's much, much better than I thought it would be. I haven't had any problems operating it or  downloading presets. It's very cool and I highly recommend this. üëçüëçüëç",
        "Shuts down intermittently In addition, shows incorrect information on watch.  Example: Text 0 / Watch 1.  For the most part I enjoy this app.  Please fix these bugs and you will get 5 stars.",
        "Crashed asus I updated to 5 stars because it works now on asus zenwatch. Only feature id like to have added is to choose the ambient picture. I have a black and white image of my watch face that I would like to use when it goes into ambient mode."

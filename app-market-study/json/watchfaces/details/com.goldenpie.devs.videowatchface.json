        "works great!",
        "Nice idea, but can't change clock / see Batt / weather / date etc. Litually digital ambient clock, rock it to show video clip with small digital clock at top and stops again. Needs more options to make it shine but as before nice idea... Just finish it off with optional different analogue/digital designs and widgets like Batt or date or weather please",
        "I love this watch face, the only problem I am having is only being able to upload 1 gif. I really like the idea of this though.",
        "Wont work It wont change from nyan cat and i keep trying and waiting but nothings happening even after i tried reinstalling it",
        "Works good. I was a little concerned about battery life, but it doesn't seem to be so much. I would like to have the choice of more fonts and showing date and battery life",
        "It's pretty cool to use GIFs as a Watch Face."

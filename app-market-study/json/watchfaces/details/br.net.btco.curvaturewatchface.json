        "Simple, most elegant and distinguished look. Could improve further, without loosing its simple cocept (choice of color, blinking little point to inform of coming info on the watch etc.)",
        "Nice looking watchface Can you add the option to I change font sizes?  Especially the date in the corner.  Will give 5 stars.",
        "Looks great but doesn't fit the circular design of the Moto 360Sport. I can barely read the day and there is no date because of it. Otherwise it looks great.",
        "Awesome love it please can we have an update to change the colour thanks",
        "Cool but no 24h option?",
        "Beautiful watch face but needs a customization options."

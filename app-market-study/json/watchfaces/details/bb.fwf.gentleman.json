        "Great watch face! One of my best purchases so far. Only 1 thing missing to be 5 Stars of pure perfection: I beg the developers to please add a TRUE square design for us, owners of an Asus Zenwatch 2 with square screen. Please implement and the rating will be perfect!!, Thanks for listening.",
        "It's a great looking watch face, however. The 4 Roman Numeral is IV not IIII.  Minor issue, but it bugs me."

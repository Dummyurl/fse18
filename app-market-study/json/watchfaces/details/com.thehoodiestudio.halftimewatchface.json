        "This app almost has all i wanted .  but just wish it would show how many notifications i have waiting to view.. will that be implimented soon? and maybe also no image in ambient?  thank you!",
        "I like this watch face but the tiny text only gets worse in Ambient mode. And the background becomes a gross distortion of black and white. I would have preferred the background disappeared completely in Ambient. A solid black background with clear and legible numbers and letters. Asus ZenWatch 2.",
        "Paid for premium to support the mustache one by this dev, turned out to love this one just as much! Going to go buy the third face to support this team. Best part is they don't need any unreasonable permissions!",
        "Nice watch Need more options to control the fonts and to make it bold or bigger.",

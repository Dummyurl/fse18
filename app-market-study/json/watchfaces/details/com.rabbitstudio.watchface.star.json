        "Delay in working on Sony SmartWatch 3 Paid for this, downloaded and installed and it took 3 days for it to appear on my SW3 and the latest version of Android Gear. Both screens DO look brilliant and hope the selection will be expanded in the future - Vader? Stormtrooper? BB8?",
        "Wont work on Moto 360 v2? **Update: On Jan. 2nd I got a message saying that this watch face has been installed. Well thats fine but it took a few weeks to show up. I even power reset phone and watch when it didn't work. Anyways, it's working... now. Changed 2 stars to 4 stars.** This watch faces doesn't seem to work on my Moto 360 v2 (2015 model). It says it's installed but doesn't show up in the watch faces menu on my watch and phone. I've reset and waited, but nothing. Noticed this watch face app hasn't been updated since August.",

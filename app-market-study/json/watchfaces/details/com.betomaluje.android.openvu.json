        "No Tizen support can't get my Sony watch UPDATE Tried to send the watchface to a friends s2 gear with no luck. Attempted to select the pokemon then even changed some colors and still no luck after sent. The developer explained that the watch isn't android wear but tizen so sadly it won't work properly. But it also doesn't work with my new smart watch 3 by Sony. No watch faces to select or anything....I paid 2$ before this was free the creater did refund my money but I would like to see the 12 hour clock option as well",
        "It works. . OK...one thing I have to say.... For the pokemon watchface... Can u also put the option to change it to the 12 hour format and not 24hr.... Plzzzzzzzzz",
        "Pls let us switch pokemon on the watch itself Just rotate through them with a swipe or bottom tap or something would be enough",

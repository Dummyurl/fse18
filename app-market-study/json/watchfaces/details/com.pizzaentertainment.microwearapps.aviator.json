        "Just Satisfied! I dont know why i bought this watchface i thought it would have features like most of the paid watchfaces now a days but the only feature it has its changin the watchface color nothing else. Disappointed!",
        "Just OK is right Normally when you spend money for an app you don't have anymore ads, sadly this is not so with this watch face.",
        "One of my most used faces. Im Looking for a white faces version of this too if anyone knows of one.",
        "Doesn't work with S3",
        "Disguised Spyware? Beautiful watch face but ridiculous permissions! This watch face shows only the time. No customization options whatever. Why does it need network, access to SD card and many more intrusive permissions? Stinks like Spyware to me! D-E-L-E-T-E-D that crap!",
        "as ridiculous as beautiful but mostly ridiculous. when will u guys learn that we need options. we need the face to stay on for more than a second. uninstalling"

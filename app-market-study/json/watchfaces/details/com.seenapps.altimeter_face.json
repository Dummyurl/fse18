    "description": "This watch face is an original creation the second entry in my \"Pilot's Toolkit\" series. I have seen many attempts at turning Altimeters into watch faces. Yet, I had to create this one.In my humble opinion, they all failed to capture two basic principles of this iconic flight instrument:- It must be 0 based. The whole point of the altimeter is to know your offset from the ground / 0.- It should not contain 2 digits numbers. You have never seen 10, 11 or 12 on an Altimeter :)This is an attempt to capture the \"spirit\" of a classic avionics Altimeter as opposed to be a yet another Bell&Ross replica.The small and big hands indicate hours and minutes. You may notice a slight bevel effect on the hands tails.Seconds are visible via an actual see-through window on the right, which reveals a spining disc. I kept the IN.Hg index (normally a pressure offset) to replicate the actual instrument.Date is displayed in the upper left window on a rotating bezel.Accent color (used to draw date) is configurable via on-watch menu.Battery Level is represented by the striped area. If you see all of it, you are at 100%, half at 50% and so on. It does not provide a detailed reading but preserves the look and feel. Ambient mode removes everything but hands tips and main ticks, rendered with a light green glow.Do not hesitate to drop feature requests at support@seenapps.comIf you like our watches, don't miss the good stuff https://twitter.com/SeenApps",

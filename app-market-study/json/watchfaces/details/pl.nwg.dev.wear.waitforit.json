Use at work, school, while a boring meeting. Set the start and end time in the companion app to see how quickly the time flies.The application contains two watch faces, analog and digital, together with separate layouts for circular and square screens. Optionally you can force using the circular layout on a square screen if you like it more. The progress may be shown as the progress bar or as sliding two-colored background. On the start and end of the period you set the watch will vibrate and display a notification.The digital watch face shows some additional info: when you're out of the period set, it displays how much time left for the timer to start. Useful if you'd like to know if you're about to be late for work again. ;)After installing the application wait about 30 seconds, and select the watch face either on your watch or in the companion application. You will not see the app in the app drawer.CAUTION: Please make sure whether you have Android Wear 5.0.1 installed on your watch.

Also since this is a paid app can there be an option to remove the text \"wait4it\" from the watchface? Looks wayyyy too cluttered."

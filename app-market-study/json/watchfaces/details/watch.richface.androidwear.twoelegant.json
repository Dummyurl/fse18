        "Unable to change colors to the ones that I want. Cannot get steps on one of the indicators will not change. Not real happy with this one.  In response to the Developer, yes, I did try to change the colors via the app. Got it to work sometimes. The text colors are the ones giving me the problems. Making changes to  the watch is not very responsive. As for the \"steps\"....yes, I'm connected to FIT. I show the left indicator on the app but the watch still shows Watch and phone indications. For some reason it won't change.   If we can get this to work, I'll change my star rating. I do like this watch face.",
        "New Best, an Analog face with up to four external complications. This is my new favorite. I picked black active and ambient and it looks great. Was able to pick Ext heart rate, step counter, meeting, and weather no other watch face I found could do this. One minor fault the numbers if you pick them are ugly",
        "Bought on my phone, then wanted me to buy again on my watch. Then kept declining payment (figured I could get a refund for one of the payments)... Says Huawei watch is compatible even... Can't even put on my phone!",
        "I would like this to be my go-to watch face. I like the style, the resolution, the customizability. However there is one thing I consider to be a major problem. When you choose to display the date it displays the day of the week and the full name of the month. It does not display the date.   followup:  If I use the right complication and not the top I can get a month date display. I would prefer it on top, but it is not enough of an issue to keep this from being my go to watch face.",
        "The Arabic numerals look so bad. They are blocky and different colors. Take a look at the 6 in the image. So ugly I wouldn't want to use it.",
        "Didn't look as nice as I expected on my zen watch 2. Maybe if I had a round watch it might look better. Unfortunately missed the refund window. But still giving 4 stars because it's legit"

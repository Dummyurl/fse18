        "Pretty good Looks realistic, which is a big plus. However, can't choose what's shown on the inner dials. (Also, phone power dial constantly at 0, LG watch R paired with Nexus 6, M)",
        "Looks great. My LG G Watch R ambient mode is a little to bright and washes out pretty much any watch face but yours still looks pretty nice!",
        "Great but colour change option? Hope this gets a read by the developer, looked great on my LG G watch R, however now I have the LG Urbane in silver and it doesn't look quite right. Add the option for silver hands and numbers then it is perfect!",
        "Good But 6 is cut off on Moto 360. On the 360, it would look better if the 6 just wasn't there.",
        "Nice face I really like the face. Looks like on my LG Watch R. Please fix the setting so it accessible via the android wear app instead of having the setting in the apps list."

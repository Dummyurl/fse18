        "Beautiful, but... I wish I had the option not to show the seconds ticking away in the digital clock mode. Also the blinking colons between the numbers seem old fashioned, redundant (because of the second ticker), and kind of angry. Without these features, I think the digital version would seem more serene. It'd also be nice to have the option to put some sort of indicator around the outside edge of the analog clock, to make it easier to read.",

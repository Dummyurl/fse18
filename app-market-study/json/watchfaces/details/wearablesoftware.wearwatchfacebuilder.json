        "Seems like a good app, with a lot of options, but i have yet to finish a face, before the app crashes. i9305, rooted stock rom.  Edit - App seems a bit more stable with the original System DPI. Could still use some more documentation regarding expressions. Seems like there are more possibilities here, than are presented in the actual list of available expressions. Edit, runs flawlessly on custom ROM.  Seems to be a week ahead of my calendar though, could be an issue with the whole week 1 starts on jan.1. or the first monday after jan.1. Turns out this is also dependant on the ROM I am using.",
        "Liked it so much I bought it.  Best one out there.  It looks complicated, and took 10 min to figure out some of the text stuff, but it was worth it for how well it works.  I've made 2 so far and they are better than anything I've seen in other apps.",
        "Clearly a work in progress but you can do so much with it! However it IS crashing VERY often. Using a 1st Gen moto 360 and a Galaxy Avant SM-G386T *EDIT* Oh and the coordinates don't seem to correlate to each other.",
        "Great app Brilliant app but it would really help if there was some documentation, I have discovered that conditional (if) statements exist but not sure exactly how they are formatted or how I can alter the true/false that it returns",
        "Nice but needs improvement I suggest developer to study sony SW2 interface. Please add option for phone battery, walk counter of google fit and message preview tnx",
        "Only 6 designs Gutted paid £3.99 for the app,  looking forward to some nice designs however I only get 6. Unable to refund"

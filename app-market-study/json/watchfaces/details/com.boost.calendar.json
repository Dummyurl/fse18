        "I don't see the brightly colored pie-chart style pictured. I'm only getting low-visibility, muted gray-on-white (or on black) lines and wedges, even for appointments assigned bright colors on my Google calendar. The date obscures the hands near the 9 too much.",
        "Shows up for my Moto360 but not on my Fossil Q at the same time.  Is this by design or through error?",
        "It is really what I want: the price is a bit steep, but it's something really worthy. My suggestion: multiple calendar synchronizations, 12h time span, outlook accounts and more color customization, at least for the hilight color.",
        "Not bad. Works ok on my Huawei Watch 2 Sports. Gives all the relevant information at a glance. Will never miss another appointment.  Thanks.",
        "I would love to give it a try but I have installed and unistalled it multiple times now and cannot get it to show up as an option for my Huawei watch.  I am now past my Google play return time and would like a refund if I cannot get it load on my watch.  I have read through the notes and tried resyncing all apps and it still will not show up.",
        "While it looks useful, I couldn't get this watchface to recognize any events on my Calender and there is no settings to control this at all. My watch is synced so the events show up on other apps on the watch, just not for this. Never take control away from the user like this as it puts them in a situation where they can't do anything to address the problem themselves.  For reference, I'm using a Sony Smartwatch 3 which has a square face."

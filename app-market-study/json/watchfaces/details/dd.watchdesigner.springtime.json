        "Love this face! This is the only watch face I've loved enough to purchase. It's pretty, and it has the date! (Usually you can get one or the other, but not both). I have it set to change hourly which keeps me entertained.",
        "Love it but... Since the last update, I can't change the ambient display. It's stuck on full.",
        "Love this but...... I'd really like to use 24hr time on the main watch face. Is that possible? I have it on the ambient face.",
        "Wonderful watch face! Love the spring watch faces. It's so fresh looking and has a great clean design. Only thing I'd like, is if we the customer could chose what watch face colour / look we want. I appreciate the thought but it would be nice to have the freedom to choices what watch face we'd like that day. As some of the daily designs on a given day are not to my liking. Many thanks!"

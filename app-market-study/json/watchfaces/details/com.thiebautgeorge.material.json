        "Never showed up... Wish this had worked, seems like a decent watch face. Can see the app on my phone, but not in Android Wear, the settings don't stay set in the app, and it doesnt ever shiw up not on the watch. Restarted both, resynced the apps, nothing.  Guess that's why there's a refund button.  Read some of the previous responses and got it resolved. Very nice watch face.  You might want to fix that installation process though.",
        "Everyone loves free But sometimes to get quality you have to put out that money! This watch face is modern, elegant and informative! It's customizable and clean! Numbers are clear and the app does little to nothing to the battery. Highly recommend and look forward to future updates! ðŸ™‹",
        "Nice and clean Tried loads of faces think this one's a keeper.  One thing I miss is watch battery meter. Could you add that as a option to the bottom right? I'm using a Sony smartwatch 3 and theres loads of space there.",
        "Good watch face. I really like this watch design.  I thought I had battery problems with it but it seems to have resolved.  After using some other faces, the only things I would say this face needs are maybe some options for battery notifications in the top corners.",
        "Awesome, saves your battery This is by far the best watch face  for battery longevity. All the others kill me LG G watch in 8 hrs.  This watch face will last two days. Also the dev is super responsive to emails.",
        "Always coming back to this one. This watch face is great. It's simple, quick to change settings, and easy to read. Only gripe would be no built in step counter or battery amount, but those would probably clutter the screen to much."

        "Copycat. Title and texts are \"borrowed\" from other, successful watchface \"minimal and elegant\", a well designed and stuffed with tons of possibilities original. Make your decision. Will you get an original, with updates nearly every week, or will you just install a poor copy of it with less functionality?",
        "This is a fake, not the real minimal and elegant watchface. Not even close to offering the customisation that the real deal can. If you were directed here looking for the real minimal and elegant, you will be left disappointed. I've let the author of the real app know that someone's trying to copy their app.  KNOW THE DIFFERENCE"

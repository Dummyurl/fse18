        "How can i open this app on the phone? And the meter isnt showing on my watch?!",
        "Gorgeous watch! 2 suggestions!  1. An option to switch between the white background by day and the black one at night!  2. An option to randomize between some preselectable colors (5/7 should be enough) everytime I tilt to view! Will keep the novelty factor going.. Will keep it fresh!   Great work Florian! Yummy material design goodness! üòç Thanx so much. This is now my default watch face!",

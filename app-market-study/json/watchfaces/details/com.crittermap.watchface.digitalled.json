        "I like this watch face, but it is not displaying my steps correctly. I can walk 200 steps and it will show up as well over 1000 steps. I can check my steps in Google fit and it displays correctly there. I think the face looks much better when Style Outline is checked. I wish the font was slightly bigger as it's a little hard to read. Access the settings for this  face via the Android Wear app.",
        "One of the few digital faces that show the digital seconds; my reason for getting it.   The font could be heavier for more easy readability.  Color selection is off.  What shows as yellow in photos and on selection screen in AndroidWear App shows as orange on the actual watch face.   I think my usual face will still be Glance on my Zenwatch 2 (this is the Glance face that came with the Zenwatch software). Only if I need seconds display will I use this or another digital seconds face.",
        "I cannot find the app on my phone..says it is installed...it is no where",
        "Love the style, but not my favorite face I have an Asus ZenWatch and I love the look and the color options, but wish the font on the square style faces was a little larger.",
        "Great I only bought this to support Nathan and the team with their fantastic BCN work, but I'm very pleased with it. Thanks again guys!",
        "Good face Great face, though im having issues with it showing step data from Google Fit."

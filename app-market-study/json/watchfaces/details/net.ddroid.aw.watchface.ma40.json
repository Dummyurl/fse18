        "Why does it start off in black and White mode!!? What is it about this particular watchface that (apparently) requires the flicker from black and white to the actual (cool looking) watch face. I have a bunch of watchfaces from this dev and they don't do this. Just this one and one other one, the A41 for Moto 360 watchface. Considering a person mostly only looks at their watch for a fraction of a second, the actual non b&w version rarely gets seen.",

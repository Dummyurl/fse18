        "Good watchface with full-color ambient mode and hourly vibration, too bad no manual weather location. Update 1: -1 for developer reply. Conversion from € to €? Seems developer doesn't understand concept of user review and uses developer reply to attack reviews. Not cool, I paid for the app. All mentioned features are available elsewhere. Update 2: - 1 for unsolicited notification ads.",

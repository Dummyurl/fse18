    "description": "Finally, a simple watchface that shows the time with round bars. I designed this watch because I was tired of my Google Now cards coming up and blocking the time on so many beautiful watch faces, making them unusable. I added a slight angle to the watch numbers so you can see them when you lift your wrist but don't bring it directly in front of your face.I searched a bit on the Play Store for an app that allowed you to display the time in a simple manner like this, but couldn't find anything that wasn't busy or trying to do too many things, so I made my own, I hope you like it!Tested with my Moto 360, it SHOULD display nicely on other watches, let me know if there are display issues.This project has been rewritten to use the Android Wear Watch Face API, this does break compatibility with Wear devices that aren't updated to 5.0W. Hopefully this isn't an issue as everyone should have gotten that update about a week ago, but let me know if this doesn't work for you.Possible future features:Editable time angleKeywords: Android Wear, Circle Watch, Watchface",

Will donate as soon as I can open the application. And also rate a 5 after it works again. Thanks! = ) update: uninstalled old version and reinstalled and it now works. Hope that helps others with issue.",

        "Orientation I appreciate this info on my wrist! I have a Moto 360. I just wish it looked better like it does on a square shaped watch. The alignment of the text is not so great looking on the round display.",
        "As soon as I got this my watch resartedðŸ˜¢",
        "I really like it, the developer is great I really like the basic design and simple design.  I would happily pay for a version that I can make green or even add a background to if I wanted. The developer is very responsive to change requests.",
        "Scryb Nice",
        "Awesome. Only issues are, as in the description, notifications obscure the watch too much, and the \"t\" on Checkpoint is occasionally truncated on the LG G Watch when certain digits are showing on the countdown.",
        "Love it But please make it green!"

        "Winner! Very funky watch face. We'll recommended to anybody who wants something different.",
        "Looks neat on the Moto360 I used it for a day because it looks cool and minimalist. I stopped using it because my watch had trouble waking up, only while using this watch face. I'm not sure if it's Orbital's fault or not; I just see that the problem goes away when I use a different face.",
        "Cool, but buggy... When I put this on my moto 360, it wouldn't turn on, it looks great, though.",
        "Pretty cool app Would love to see more colors in the future.",
        "Love it!"

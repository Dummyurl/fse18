        "I like the watch face, but thought there was a glitch initially, and gave a 3 star review, but since, the devoper  got back and explained what I was doing wrong. Thank you and I really glad he did, since I find this a very sharp looking and practical watch face. Worth every penny of the dollar it costs.",
        "Looks Great,  but very buggy Looks great but keeps killing the battery and freezing on my moto 360. Will have to uninstall unfortunately",
        "Awesome face This is a unique watch face with some of the smoothest animations I've ever seen. Battery life is great. Developer is very quick and helpful with email responses."

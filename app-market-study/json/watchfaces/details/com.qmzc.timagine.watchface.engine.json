        "Really Nice But! On my LG R Watch Urban the graphics does not fill the clocks display. It's a five star rating if that would be corrected plus the ability to do other colors ;-) Also us that are not constrained by the Moto 360's 'flat tire' would be nice if we could utilize that part for something. Maybe the pedometer? Also a 24 hour setting would be really nice for us not on the am/pm side of things :-)",
        "very cool... hi. I meant maybe a tap active area to pop up day of week/date as I think showing on main display might be tricky..cheers",
        "By far the best watch face I absolutely love this thing and even the features are free sure you do not get detailed information about steps and battery but you do get an Idea and the phone battery didn't work but I still absolutely love it.",
        "Small face is hard to read on my Smartwatch 3, plus the card preview covers up the face instead of staying below it."

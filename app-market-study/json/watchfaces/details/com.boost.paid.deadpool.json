        "Need help! Having problems with this on my Smartwatch 3 since I upgraded my phone to Oreo. Every time I install to my watch it remove itself.",
        "Really great app especially the preview option!",
        "Can only access one of the faces and cannot change settings. Otherwise great app",
        "Almost There I really like this watch face. It's very polished. The only thing I would like to see implemented is the ability to change the date and battery level. I would like to be able to check my phone battery and check the current temperature. The watch battery is too easy to check and seems like a waste of notification space.",
        "Nice Is nice but it annoys me that the time is down the bottom so that notifications cover it up. Would REALLY love the option to have the ambient version as the watch for the whole time, is that possible?"

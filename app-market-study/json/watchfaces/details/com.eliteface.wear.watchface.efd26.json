        "Fun for Halloween! I like the watch face and the animations. The menu needs to look less like an ad and more like a menu. I tried to remove the year but the option doesn't work. Also, I'd like to see the seconds of the time removable. Thank you for such a cool watch face!",
        "The battery says NO My Huawei watch can usually last 1.5 to 2 days when I use original watch faces. With this one, my watch battery drops from 100% to 0 in 4 hours. Poor performance. Design is cool though.",
        "So cool To have showing, something as cool but,  I digress, Ok apple didn't make anything like it. They should have,  I want more theme packs!",
        "Great but no animation on LG urbane Love the look but the animations are not working on the lg urbane",
        "You have to pay for animation Settings are clunky and difficult to follow. No animation unless you pay.",
        "Creepy Cool Excellent Halloween Watch! Smooth animations and looks awesome!! Premium version is only a dollar and change to activate animations. So very cool for so little cost!! üéÉüëç‚åöüòé"

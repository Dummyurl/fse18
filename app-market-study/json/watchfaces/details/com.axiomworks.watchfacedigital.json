        "Awsome Fluid animation, oddly satisfying textures, nice colors. Although being able to customize those colors would gain a fifth star!",
        "Great start Full ambient mode and a date option would get a fifth star.",
        "A mixed bag 3 stars because most are blurry (by design,  I  think). 5 stars for the ones that aren't. The red LCD with green bkgd is a frequent go-to watch face.",
        "A few suggestions 1. Add an option to display the date. 2. Make the seconds smaller.",
        "Amazing Probably one of the best watch faces in my opinion. Simple and a marvel to look at. Keep it up !!!",
        "Interesting!"

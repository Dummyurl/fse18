        "I really want to rate it good but.. The watchface is crashing randomly through my day on my Huawei Watch. Already crashed 6 times in less than 8 hours. The battery meter is not accurate at all and sometimes weather does not update... It has the potential but has many bugs too.",
        "Fresh design, really looks great on my LG Urbane. The _one_ problem I'm having, however, is the lack of Fahrenheit conversion.",
        "Good looking watch face with a lot of issues. Love the watch face and design. However force closes frequently, and the battery metres does not sync.",
        "Awesome, but... Battery meter not accurate and temperature not changeable to Fahrenheit",
        "Could be better Nice clean design, but phone/watch battery meters are Not showing correct percentage.",
        "Great design, no features Please let me disable weather or change the unit."

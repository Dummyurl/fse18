        "Simple and Easy to Read While there are many minimal watch faces, some are perhaps a bit too minimal and make it a chore to read the time. This has found a great balance and has found its way to being my main watch face. I would love to be able to choose the color of the outer and inner ring separately though.",
        "Love the face with one issue The ambient mode does not show anything on my Gear Live. It goes grey for a second, then the display goes black. Other than that issue, I love this face.",
        "Love the design of this but ambient mode not working (Asus Zenwatch and Nexus 5) just goes grey then blank screen, see another reviewer has same problem but with different setup. Idea of having nice design is to show it off, don't want blank screen so not using ðŸ˜© hope it can get fixed soon, until then 4* for design but can't give 5* until can use it (know it's my choice not to but I want to! â˜º).",
        "I love it It reminds me of the digimon crest of light (and courage).  Since I use that at a screensaver, I LOVE having that on my watch",
        "Really like this style, any chance the 4 small dots are going to turn into more precise minutes?"

        "Cool looking but info not updating Watch face looks great, however weather and SMS count stuck or not updating. I updated my rating after reinstall, still  temperature stuck at n/a , and not updating SMS count update: 6/23/16 after OS update to 1.5 started getting updates on screen",
        "Doesn't drain battery on moto 360 Considering how complex thus gave looks I feared it'd drain like crazy. No issues. Props for reminding me of the metro ui just a bit",
        "Semi Useable watchface Has everything I need for my \"at work\" watchface. Really only usable during the day as its WAY too bright and in your face for nighttime use. Would bump it up another couple of stars if I could change the font and the colors to my liking. Maybe some subtle grays or subdued colors.",
        "Looks great, but battery hog This looks awesome on my Sony Smart Watch 3. Great aambient mode, highly readable, bright flat colours. Definitely worth it, a big favourite, until I compared battery life with the standard Sony watch faces - super square uses  maybe 1/3 more. :(",
        "Big and bold Really nice but needs pedometer to synch with the Google fit data as I'm getting 2 different step totals",
        "Simple I love it Looks great on the SW3"

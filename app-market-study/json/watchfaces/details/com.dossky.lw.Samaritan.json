        "Amazing!! This guy is a genius! I hope you can make one for The Machine aswell! That would be insane. Keep up the good work. Hopefully in next update we can run it under lockscreen aswell",
        "Very nice, but could be improved I'm loving the wall paper but as previous comments mentioned would be awesome to input your own lines and the line goes through the time on my moto 360. Fix those and it'll be 5 starts...",
        "Perfect just android wear support pls Dont stop support because this is awsome wallpaper.  Just if you can make smartwatch face with words and clock pls :)",
        "Brilliant Huge huge fan of the show. Absolutely love this app. I wish I could set it as my lock screen though. Would love for someone to try and use my phone only to see 's are being watched' appear. The look on their face would be amazing",
        "Very cool, but... Could be much cooler with built in search functionality. Wonder if it would be possible to integrate with google to perform phone tasks. Just like using S voice on samsung, but without the voice, just the text.",
        "This is very cool. I'm a huge fan of the show so this just made my day.  Looking forward to more updates though...is it possible to get a clock for the phone itself w/out the Android wear?  Something that we could use say for an alarm clock?"

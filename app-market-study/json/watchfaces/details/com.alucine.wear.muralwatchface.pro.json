        "Cj Jones Excellent watchface, easily the best in the Playstore. Only wish I could switch photos more frequently than 30 min, but that's a minor quibble. The find my phone feature doesn't seem to work on my 360/Note4 but that's not a big deal to me either.  *edit* Find my phone is working now.",
        "Levy Rubbish not worth the money. Does not shuffle photos on the watch and can't change my favorite telephone numbers. Need refund!",
        "Great Watch Face Options So far loving the app.   I purchased the Pro version, but at times the app doesn't recognize that.   Hopefully it'll correct itself with an update.",
        "Great! I put in preferences that I do not want to see adult content, but I keep getting soft core porn pics available. I have changed the default category for the pictures, so this is no longer a problem. Thanks for answering, and for making a great app!",
        "Excellent Liked it so much, this is the first time I've ever paid for a pro version of an app! Fast tech support. Very easy to add your own pics for the watch face. Love the one tap to bring up current appointments, steps and contacts.",
        "Mural Pro has all the features I've been looking for in a great watchface. 1) Choose of colors on the ambient display. 2) Add your own photos and choose duration between switching. 3) Multiple screens for different item. 4) Many useful features in the apps options (setup). 5) Developer responds to questions very quickly. Look over the features in the Playstore description, it's a winner!!"

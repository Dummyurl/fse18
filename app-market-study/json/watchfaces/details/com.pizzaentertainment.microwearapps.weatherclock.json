        "Beautifully designed, Utterly Useless The battery percentage is totally off. Even if you clear data, delete/reinstall, etc. The weather is good it appears. It's too beautiful of an application, and it's a PAID APP, to be screwed up like this. Emailed development team and never get any responses or confirmation they received it at the least.",

        "Beautiful Love it. Keep up the good work.",
        "Nice, 5 stars",
        "Battery life wrong. One of things I like most about my watchfaces is the battery life, this one was off by at least 15% or more. Refunded."

        "Great looking but with a few issues *using Moto G2 with LG Urbane* the watch face looks great, and ambient mode is fantastic with the simple look, however there a few issues with the face. The unread message count is just staying on constantly after message has gone, and even after restarting the watch, and in ambient mode the now cards block the bottom of the screen which let to me turning off the now card preview. If these issue were fixed, the face would easily be 5*",
        "Almost perfect, ambient cards need work This is a great looking face, but the say peek cards show in ambient mode isn't good. The background of the card is full black, covering everything. It makes the watch look like it has a huge flat tire, or like something's wrong. It doesn't look good at all. Ideally, I'd like to see the card background be semi transparent so the watch face still shows through. But even fully transparent would look better than what it is now.",
        "Option to turn off weather? Got this beautiful watchface but uninstalling because no option to to either manually enter weather location or to turn off weather widget.  Please create this option as having GPS running on my phone as it drains the batery. If the weather widget can be turned off or switched off or to another widget function I would buy almost all the Rich watch faces.",
        "Fix it and it is my daily watch face Was using futuristic for last few months but I like this one even more. I had a hard time seeing the battery levels with futuristic but the gauges on this one are easy. I really like the look of it. Two issues, temperature is unreadable font AND missed call icon doesn't clear after clearing on phone.",
        "Minor bug Would be five stars if not for a bug where the SMS indicator keeps showing 1 unread message. Lost another two stars for not updating since 2015 and the SMS indicator bug has been mentioned by other users for over a year.",
        "Just shy of great... Probably my favorite watch face right now,  but indeed hindered by the fact that it 'sometimes' shows still having messages when I have none. Please fix?"
